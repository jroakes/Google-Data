Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to systems and methods for recording text narratives and images about events and, more particularly, to systems and methods for organizing the recorded text narratives and images using tags that are defined with respect to characters depicted in the text narratives and images.
- Tags have become a popular tool for organizing content.
- a tag is a keyword that is defined by the user for classifying the content.
- a user may define multiple tags for an object.
- Tags are often associated with web pages or images.
- tags One major feature of tags is that it is user-defined. As a result, objects that cannot be parsed by a computer and automatically indexed, like images, can be indexed in accordance with user-defined tags. In addition, unlike hierarchical categorization schemes or computer generated indexing schemes, classification by tags can be highly personalized.
- tags for organizing images is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 2006/0064639.
- images are organized by tagging them with informative keywords defined by the user and grouping images together into conceptual photo albums.
- a selected group of images is then published into a photo book that is made available over the Internet or published as individual image prints.
- a tag may be defined as public or private.
- a public tag is shared with other users and is linked with other users who have used the same tag, so that all objects that are associated this tag may be accessed through this tag.
- the sharing of public tags has been a major reason behind the expansive use of tags.
- Some of the popular web services that provide for public sharing of user-defined tags include TechnoratiTM, del.icio.us, and FlickrTM.
- a private tag is not shared with other users. Only the user who created the private tag may use it to access the objects associated with private tag. Private tags are useful in allowing a user to organize information in accordance with his or her personalized classification scheme.
- tags creates an inherently ambiguous system.
- objects associated with the tag “apple” may include web pages and images relating to fruits or web pages and images relating to the computer company.
- objects associated with the tag “windows” may include web pages and images relating to openings provided in structures or web pages and images relating to a computer operating system.
- Embodiments of the present invention employ tags to organize text narratives and images about events that are being maintained in a computer system, and also provide a computer system and method for using tagged information in novel ways.
- tagged information is used in the process of inviting prospective users to the computer system.
- tagged information is used in the process of helping users recollect and reconstruct their life stories.
- character tags are tags that are defined with respect to those persons that are depicted in the text narratives and images.
- Each character tag is associated with either a user profile that is created when a user registers with the computer system or a pseudo-profile.
- a pseudo-profile typically includes a person's name, and may also include the person's e-mail address and phone number.
- a pseudo-profile for a person is created by a user when the user does not know if the person has a user profile in the computer system.
- the computer system examines if a pseudo-profile has been created by the user for the prospective user. If so, the character tag associated with this pseudo-profile is used to retrieve text narratives and images that have been indexed with this character tag. When the invitation e-mail is sent out to the prospective user, the retrieved stories and images are made available to the prospective user for viewing.
- text narratives and images that have been indexed with various tags including character tags may enable collaborative storytelling by helping users recollect and reconstruct their life stories.
- the computer system searches the content database for potential matching events that have been depicted by other users. If a potential match is found, the computer system transmits the relevant content to the user. The potential match may be determined based on matches of location and date of the events and characters depicted in the events.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a networked computer environment in which systems and methods according to embodiments of the present invention may be implemented.

- the server computer 110 is programmed to operate as a network server that communicates with the client computers 120 .
- the server computer 110 is programmed as a web server that communicates with the client computers 120 using the TCP/IP protocol, and hosts a web site that can be accessed by the client computers 120 .
- the client computers 120 are programmed to execute web browser programs and access the web pages managed by the server computer 110 by specifying a uniform resource locator (URL) for the server computer 110 into the browser.
- URL uniform resource locator
- the server computer 110 manages the contents stored in the mass storage unit 113 using a relational database software.
- the contents include profile data of the registered users of the web site.
- the profile data specify: user ID, password, name, e-mail, address including zip code, gender, marital status, date of birth, occupation, a pointer to an image file, various permission settings, and other similar data.
- the contents further include interview questions, multimedia files such as image files, video files, audio files and flash animation files, life stories posted by the users, commentaries made to the posted life stories, user-defined private circle data, and such other data needed by the server computer 110 to process data received from the users and render web pages requested by the users.
- users are respectively operating the client computers 120 that are connected to the server computer 110 over the Internet. Also, web pages that are displayed to a user are transmitted from the server computer 110 to that user's client computer 120 and processed by the web browser program stored in that user's client computer 120 for display through the monitor of that user's client computer 120 .
- FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of a web page that is generated by the server computer 110 and transmitted to a user for display when the user accesses the web site managed by the server computer 110 , and logs in using his or her user ID and password.
- the web page identifies the web site “OurStory” and the user who logged in with the user's name (Jane Johnson) and the user's image.
- the user can access her life stories by accessing the My Story hyperlink provided in a navigation section 210 of the web page.
- Other hyperlinks are provided on the web page to allow the user to view and change her profile (Profile hyperlink) and the account settings (Settings hyperlink).
- the web site permits a single registered user to keep multiple profiles and maintain life stories for each person, group, and sometimes fictional characters, represented in the profiles. This feature may be used in situations where it is preferred to write the life stories from a third person point of view, or for a group of people (e.g., the Smith family or the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team) or a fictional character, or where the subject of the life stories is not computer savvy.
- the Switch Profile hyperlink is provided to users who are maintaining multiple profiles to allow such users to switch to another profile and view and manage the life stories of the person, group, or fictional character represented in the other profile.
- the web page further provides various other graphical user interface (GUI) elements. They include a navigation section 210 , a question section 220 , an image gallery 230 , an inbox 240 , and a collaboration section 250 .
- GUI graphical user interface

- the question section 220 also provides question navigation hyperlinks “Previous” and “Next” using which the user can turn to the previous question or the next question that is in the queue of questions that have been posed to this user.
- the input of the answer followed by a click on the Preview button causes the display of a preview web page similar to the one shown in FIG. 3F , using which the user can either publish the answer as a life story or cancel it.
- the server computer 110 saves the answer and the associated image in the mass storage unit 113 . Further, in response to either the publishing or canceling action, the next question in the queue is displayed to the user. The user may also delete a question from the queue of questions by clicking on the “Delete” hyperlink. In response to this action, the next question in the queue is displayed to the user.
- the image gallery 230 provides the user with a pictorial snapshot of the more recent activities by persons who are connected to the user or by those who belong to a special group defined by the user, e.g., the user's immediate family or the user's closest friends.
- the activities that are tracked by the image gallery 230 include recent posts of life stories by the connected users or members of the special group and recent comments made by them to the user's life stories.
- the image gallery 230 may also include recent instructional, informational, and inspirational posts submitted by other users and system generated content that are posted to encourage users to post their life stories.
- a “thread” consists of a post and any comments made concerning the post.
- the inbox 240 displays messages generated by the web site in response to actions taken by the other users of the web site.
- the messages include notices of actions taken by other users (e.g., “You have been added to group Johnson Family”) and summaries of tasks that the user has been asked to complete (e.g., “Approval required on new post from Father” and “Connection Request from David Johnson”).
- An icon is displayed alongside each message to help the user quickly identify the content of the message.
- the collaboration section 250 provides hyperlinks to a web page used to post a life story on behalf of another user and a web page used to ask questions to another user.
- the identity of the other user is displayed in this section along with that person's image. Only those users who have given the user sufficient access rights will appear in this section. In the example given here, Jane Johnson has the right to post stories on behalf of Stephen Myers, and Jane Johnson has the right to ask Louis Chang questions.
- FIG. 3A is a schematic representation of a GUI that is used for posting life stories.
- This GUI includes input fields for the title, the date, and the word description for the post. It also includes hyperlinks to web pages for adding media to the post (Media), identifying persons or groups who are part of the story (People), and specifying additional information such as locations and keywords (Organization).
- the media that is added may be any of the following: (i) images that the user uploaded, (ii) images others have uploaded and shared with the user, (iii) images that are retrieved from an image search conducted on the web based on the context of the post, (iv) images from third party photo sharing sites, (v) video files, (vi) audio files, and (vii) flash animation files.
- FIGS. 3B and 3C are schematic representations of the web page for adding media to the post.

- the web page of FIG. 3C provides the user with the option of selecting one of the images retrieved from an Internet image search.
- the query for the Internet image search is automatically generated from the text narrative of the post using a conventional contextual search query generator.
- FIG. 3D is a schematic representation of the web page for marking the post with character tags, which are tags that are defined with respect to those persons that are depicted in the text narratives and images.
- Each character tag is associated with either a user profile or a pseudo-profile.
- a pseudo-profile typically includes a person's name, and may also include the person's e-mail address and phone number.
- a pseudo-profile for a person is created by a user when the user does not know if the person has a user profile.
- FIG. 3D shows, on the left hand side, a list of users who are connected to the user and have user profiles. If any of these users are depicted in the post, the boxes next to their names are checked to indicate the user's intention to mark the post with tags associated with their user profiles.
- the user has the option of entering the person's name and affiliation (e.g., friend or family) in the Characters input field.
- the “Add” button is selected by the user, pseudo-profiles are created for those persons named in the Characters input field.
- the pseudo-profile includes the name of the character and affiliation of this character to the user who created it.
- a post may also be tagged with the location depicted in the post and keywords defined by the user.
- the web page for inputting this data is shown schematically in FIG. 3E .
- the post is tagged with the location and keywords entered by the user.
- the table below shows conceptually how the server computer 110 keeps track of the different tags that are associated with different posts or objects.
- the starred names under the column, “Character Tags,” represent the persons for whom pseudo-profiles have been created.
- the user When the user selects the Add button or the Cancel button from the media, people, and organization web pages, shown schematically in FIGS. 3B-C , 3 D, and 3 E, respectively, the user is returned to the web page of 3 A.
- the user clicks on the Preview button, in response to which a Preview Post web page like the one shown in FIG. 3F is displayed to the user.
- the user can specify permissions levels for viewing and commenting on this post on this web page.
- a public permissions level allows any user to view and comment on this post.
- a restricted permissions level allows only those users who are in the groups that have been checked to view and comment on this post.
- the data relating to this post including the word description, the attached media file, the permissions level settings, and other data specified using the web pages accessed through the Media, People and Organization hyperlinks, are transmitted to the server computer 110 along with data that identifies the person who is the subject of this life story.
- the identifying data may be the user ID of the person submitting the life story or the user ID of the person on behalf of whom the life story is submitted. In the case where a single user is maintaining multiple profiles and their stories and the user is submitting a story for one of these profiles, the identifying data may be an ID corresponding to that profile.
- FIG. 4 is a schematic representation of the web page that is generated by the server computer 110 and transmitted to a user for display when the user selects the People hyperlink from the navigation section 210 .
- the web page provides hyperlinks to web pages for defining new private circles, and populating them with users (Create New Circles), managing invitations (Invite New Users), and performing searches of other registered users of the web site (Search Users). It also includes an image gallery of users who are connected to the user, and characters created by the user.
- a connection to the user by another user exists or can be made by: (i) the user was invited by the other user or invited the other user onto the web site; or (ii) the user places the other user into one of his or her circles.
- the users shown in the Connections window of the web page in FIG. 4 represent all users of the web site that are connected to the user.
- the View drop-down menu includes selections of user-defined private circles.
- the members that are displayed in the Connections window may be changed based on the selection made using the View drop-down menu. Also, once the display has changed to a selected private circle, other users may be added to the private circle through the Add hyperlink.
- the View hyperlink accesses the My Story web page of this user.
- the Edit hyperlink allows this user's displayed name or image to be changed.
- the Use hyperlink accesses the GUI of FIG. 3A using which a life story may be posted on behalf of this user.
- the users shown in the Characters window of the web page in FIG. 4 represent those persons for whom pseudo-profiles have been created.
- An image may or may not be available. If an image is not available, an Upload Image hyperlink is displayed.
- an Edit hyperlink appears at the bottom of the user's name. The Edit hyperlink is accessed to edit the name of the character, upload an image, or to edit or enter other pseudo-profile data, e.g., e-mail address and telephone number.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram that illustrates the method steps carried out by the server computer 110 in response to a search request that contains character tags.
- User A is submitting the search request and, in response, the server computer 110 will search all life stories that User A is permitted to access.
- the search query submitted by User A is received by the server computer 110 (step 510 ) and then parsed (step 512 ) so as to extract the one or more character tags specified in the search query.
- the server computer 110 finds and retrieves those life stories accessible by User A that have been tagged with the character tags extracted from the search query.
- the server computer 110 prepares a web page including the retrieved life stories and transmits the web page to the user who submitted the search query.
- the search conducted in FIG. 5 may be narrowed in various ways.
- the search may be limited to the life stories that User A has submitted.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram that illustrates the method steps carried out by the server computer 110 in response to a request to issue an invitation.
- User A is submitting the request to issue an invitation to a character named Jay Smith.
- the server computer 110 Upon receiving this request (step 610 ), the server computer 110 first searches User A's character list to see if User A has created a pseudo-profile for Jay Smith (step 612 ). If so, the flow proceeds to step 614 , where the server computer 110 performs a search for all life stories submitted by User A that are tagged with the character tag for Jay Smith.
- step 616 the server computer 110 prepares an invitation e-mail to Jay Smith and includes in the invitation e-mail hyperlinks to the life stories that the search returned in step 614 .
- the invitation e-mail may contain the life stories that the search returned in step 614 . If User A has not created a pseudo-profile for Jay Smith, the search step in 614 is bypassed and the invitation e-mail is sent to Jay Smith without any life story content.
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram that illustrates the method steps carried out by the server computer 110 to enable a collaborative storytelling process between two users.
- User A is recounting an event and the server computer 110 searches events recounted by other users to see if the event recounted by User A potentially matches any of the events recounted by other users. If there is a potential match, a web page is prepared including all or portion of the content relating to the matching event that another user has posted, and transmitted to User A.
- Step 710 of the process illustrated in FIG. 7 represents the storing and indexing by the server computer 110 of content relating to various events that has been input by other users.
- the server computer 110 receives content inputs relating to a particular event from User A.
- the particular event recounted by User A is then compared with the events recounted by the other users for a potential match in step 714 .
- the algorithm used for determining whether there is a potential match is described in conjunction with FIG. 8 . If a potential match is found, a web page including some or all of the content relating to this event as input by another user is prepared and transmitted to User A (step 716 ). If a potential match is not found, step 716 is bypassed and the process ends.
- FIG. 8 is a flow diagram that illustrates the method steps carried out by the server computer 110 to determine whether there is a potential match between two events.
- the two events are Event A and Event B
- content relating to Event A is input by User A
- content relating to Event B is input by User B.
- the process begins with step 810 , where the content relating to Event A is compared with the content relating to Event B.
- the dates and the location of the two events are compared (steps 812 and 814 ), and characters depicted in the two events are compared to see if there is at least one common character depicted in both events (step 816 ).
- the characters depicted in the two events may be compared by examining the names, e-mail addresses, and/or telephone numbers associated with the characters. If there is a match of the dates and location and there is at least one common character depicted in both events, it is determined that the two events potentially match (step 818 ). Otherwise, it is determined that the two events do not match (step 820 ).
