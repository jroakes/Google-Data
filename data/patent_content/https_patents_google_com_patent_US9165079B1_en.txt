Definitions
- This specification relates generally to information retrieval, particularly to modifying access controls in a search index.
- Search engines identify resources (e.g., images, audio, video, Web pages, text, documents) that are relevant to a user's needs and present information about the resources in a manner that is useful to the user.
- a search engine may be used to conduct a search of a source of data, e.g., the Internet, a social network, a local data source, non-networked content, or the like.
- a search engine receives a search query from a user, consults an appropriate search index to identify subject matter relevant to the search query, obtains snippets of the relevant subject matter, ranks the snippets, and output the snippets for presentation in a Web browser.
- An example of a technique for use with a search index includes the following operations: identifying a first group that has a specified number of entities or more; associating a first group restrict with the first group, where a group restrict includes data associated with two or more members of a group; assigning the first group restrict to one or more items of content in a search index that the members of the group can access; identifying a second group associated with a second group restrict, where the second group has fewer than the specified number of entities; and assigning searcher restricts for entities in the second group to one or more items of content in the search index, where the searcher restricts include data associated with a searcher.
- the second group restrict may be removed from the search index or from items of content in the search index to which searcher restricts for entities in the second group are assigned.
- the one or more items of content to which group restricts are assigned, and the one or more items of content to which searcher restricts are assigned includes public content.
- the public content may include information available from at least one unrestricted resource.
- the one or more items of content to which group restricts are assigned, and the one or more items of content to which searcher restricts are assigned includes private content.
- the private content may include information available from at least one restricted resource.
- An example of an operation that may be used with the foregoing technique includes updating a restrict table to reflect assignment of searcher restricts for entities in the second group.
- the restrict table may be accessible to determine which restricts to include in a search query.
- Examples of operations that may be used with the foregoing technique also include: selecting the specified number to achieve a balance between search query complexity and search index complexity; and determining the first group based on social connection among nodes of a social graph.
- Examples of operations that may be used with the foregoing technique also include: obtaining a search query, where the search query includes a group restrict and a searcher restrict; matching the group restrict to a corresponding group restrict associated with content in the search index, and matching the searcher restrict to a corresponding searcher restrict associated with content in the search index; and retrieving, from the search index, content in the search index that is associated with the corresponding group restrict, and content in the search index that is associated with the searcher restrict.
- Another example of a technique for use with a search index includes the following operations: storing content in a search index in computer memory; and storing access control lists (ACL) in association with corresponding items of content, where the ACL that corresponds to each item of content includes restricts for entities that are permitted access to the item of content, where the restricts include at least one of a searcher restrict corresponding to an entity who is permitted access to the item of content and a group restrict corresponding to a group of entities that are permitted access to the item of content.
- the operations also include modifying an ACL for an item of content in the search index because a number of entities contained in a group identified by a group restrict in the search index is less than a specified number.
- the ACL may be modified to replace the group restrict for entities in the group with corresponding entity searcher restricts.
- Examples of operations that may be used with the foregoing technique also include updating the search index so that the search index reflects modification of the ACL.
- the index may be updated within a specified period of time following modification.
- the index may be updated in response to the modification of the ACL.
- An example of an operation that may be used with the foregoing technique includes updating a restrict table to reflect modification of the ACL.
- the restrict table may be accessible to determine which restricts to include in a search query.
- Advantages of employing group restricts and searcher restricts as described in the examples above may include, e.g., decreasing the amount of information included the search query (e.g., the number of group restricts) or the amount of information contained the search index (e.g., the number of searcher restricts). As a result, performance degradation resulting from an amount of data associated with search queries and indices can be reduced.
- the systems and techniques described herein or parts thereof may be implemented as a computer program product that includes instructions that are stored on one or more non-transitory machine-readable storage media, and that are executable on one or more processing devices.
- the systems and techniques described herein or parts thereof may be implemented as an apparatus, method, or electronic system that may include one or more processing devices and memory to store executable instructions to implement the stated functions.

- FIG. 8 is a conceptual view of an example of a social graph.
- FIG. 9 shows examples of computing devices on which the processes described herein, or portions thereof, may be implemented.
- a restriction in a search context, includes data that associates a property, e.g., accessibility, to electronic content (or simply “content”) in a search index.
- a restriction includes data that associates a property, e.g., accessibility, to electronic content (or simply “content”) in a search index.
- one or more restricts can be included with the query (e.g., a textual or image query).
- a search engine matches restrict(s) included in the search query to restrict(s) associated with content in the search index. When a match is found, the content is deemed accessible to the searcher.
- the processes described herein associate (e.g., tag) content with restricts in a manner that may reduce the number of restricts that are included with a search query, or that may reduce the number of restricts that are associated with content in a search index.
- the processes include storing electronic content in a search index in computer memory, and storing access control lists (ACLs) with items of the electronic content.
- the ACL for each item of electronic content includes restricts for entities that are permitted access to the item.
- the restricts include one or more of the following: a searcher restrict that corresponds to (e.g., identifies) an entity (e.g., an individual, company, or singular item) who is permitted access to the item of content, and a group restrict that corresponds to (e.g., identifies) a group of entities (e.g., individuals or other groups) that are permitted access to the item of content.
- a group itself may be an entity (and, thus, a member of a group), in which case a group restrict may identify multiple groups that are permitted to access an item of content.
- the ACL may be modified when a number of entities contained in a group identified by a group restrict in is less than a specified number (e.g., 50 to 250). Specifically, the ACL may be modified to replace the group restrict, in that case, with corresponding individual searcher restricts.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram that shows, conceptually, an example process described herein for expanding group restricts in a search index 100 .
- Search index 100 is stored in computer memory in, e.g., a server or other hardware.
- Search index 100 includes electronic content 102 , 104 , 106 , e.g., indexed documents, images, video, audio.
- the electronic content may be from a private network and/or from a public network.
- the public and private content may be combined in a single search index or the two may be stored in separate search indexes.
- An ACL may be associated with each item of public and private content. Alternatively, ACLs may be associated with items of private content only. In the example of FIG. 1 , the content items are private content.
- Content item 102 is associated with ACL 108 ;
- content item 104 is associated with ACL 110 ;
- content item 106 is associated with ACL 112 , and so forth.
- ACL 112 includes searcher restricts 113 and 114 and group restricts 115 , 116 and 117 , along with others (not shown).
- the searcher restricts include data that is used to identify entities (e.g., a person, company, service, etc.) who are permitted to access the corresponding content item.
- the group restricts 115 , 116 and 117 include data that is associated with groups of entities that are permitted to access the corresponding content item.
- a group restrict identifies a specific group, which may include a number of entities, e.g. five, ten, 100, 1000, and so forth.
- entities who are associated with a group restrict may have some feature(s) in common that make it appropriate to grant them access to the same resource, e.g., content item (e.g., web page, video, audio, microblog posts, social network posts, endorsement, profile, and the like).
- content item e.g., web page, video, audio, microblog posts, social network posts, endorsement, profile, and the like.
- searchers who have become part of a social networking service may have access to a relatively large set of content items in the social networking service, whereas searchers who are not part of the service may not have such extensive access.
- a user inputs a search query to a search engine to conduct a search of index 100 .
- the search query may include text, images, or other content on which a search can be based.
- Incorporated automatically into the search query are: (i) the searcher restrict for that user, and (ii) group restrict(s) for groups that the user is a member of, if existing. These restricts in the search query are matched to corresponding restricts in the search index 100 in order to identify documents in the search index that the user is permitted to access. These documents may be identified by the search engine, and search results thereof presented to the user.
- expanding includes listing individual searcher restricts from the group in an ACL. Expanding groups, however, can increase the size of the search index. For example, some groups may have thousands or even millions of members. Expanding such groups for each item of content in a search index increases the size of the search index. For example, ten thousand items of content may be associated with the same group restrict. That group restrict may be a relatively small amount of data. The corresponding group, however, may have a million members. If the group restricts were expanded, then those ten thousand items of content would each need to be tagged with searcher restricts for each of the million members.
- group restrict 115 is for M (e.g., 30) entities 120 , each having a corresponding searcher restrict 121 , 122 . . . 123 . Since M is less than a specified number (e.g., 50 to 250) 125 , group restrict 115 is expanded in ACL 112 in the search index. For example, as shown by arrow 122 in FIG. 1 , the individual searcher restricts 120 for members of a group represented by group restrict 115 are incorporated, individually, into ACL 112 . In this example, group restrict 115 is also removed from ACL 112 ; although this need not be the case in each instance, as explained below.
- the amount of information included the search query (e.g., the number of group restricts) can be decreased.
- performance degradation resulting from an amount of data associated with search queries and indices can be reduced.
- a data structure e.g., a restrict table
- Other types of data structures are possible, e.g., one or more data structures that include pointers, sets of tables, or other data.
- a restrict table is associated with each individual searcher, and includes a list of groups to which the searcher belongs, among other information.
- the restrict table is updated accordingly, e.g., to add or remove the appropriate group restricts. The updating may occur automatically and as soon as the user is added to, or removed from, the group.
- restricts for groups in the restrict table are incorporated into the search query automatically, in some implementations.
- that group is typically removed from the corresponding user's restrict table.
- the group restrict will not be used to identify documents to which the user is permitted access. Rather, the user's searcher restrict will be used to identify those documents. This is possible because, in this example, instances of that group have been expanded into individual searcher restricts. In other examples, instances of that group need not be expanded.
- searcher restricts are added to a search index for entities who are members of more than a specified number of groups (e.g., more than 10 to 30 groups).
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example system for generating search indexes containing public content and private content.
- FIG. 2 shows an example of a system 200 that can be used to search for private content 252 and public content 250 .
- private content can include access-restricted content. Access to the private content may be limited by searcher and/or group restrict(s) associated with that content. Owners of private content may have the option to prevent having their private content indexed and accessed.
- Public content generally, refers to content to which access is not restricted.
- System 200 includes server 202 .
- Server 202 includes content processor 206 which, in some examples, is a crawling engine.
- Content processor 206 is configured to determine private content 252 from sources 244 , 246 , 248 , including, e.g., social networking Web sites, picture hosting Web sites, online e-mail providers, and so forth, that content processor 206 is authorized by users to access.
- sources 244 , 246 , 248 including, e.g., social networking Web sites, picture hosting Web sites, online e-mail providers, and so forth, that content processor 206 is authorized by users to access.
- users can enable/disable access to their private content, e.g., users can prevent their private content from being accessed.
- private content 252 includes a collection of items, e.g., items 216 , 218 , 220 .
- Content processor 206 may be configured to crawl sources 244 , 246 , 248 of private content to retrieve items 216 , 218 , 220 .
- sources 244 , 246 , 248 may send items 216 , 218 , 220 to content processor 206 , e.g., at pre-defined time intervals and/or when sources 244 , 246 , 248 obtain new items, including items that were not previously sent to content processor 206 .
- System 200 also includes account information repository 210 .
- Account information repository 210 is configured to store information for accessing accounts associated with sources 244 , 246 , 248 .
- a user is provided with the option of specifying which private content may be determined by the content processor and/or of specifying that only public content 250 be searched for a user.
- content processor 206 may be configured to translate content in items 216 , 218 , 220 to a normalized format.
- normalization includes reformatting disparate types of content items into a standardized structure.
- content processor 206 generates normalized items 260 , 262 264 by normalizing the content of items 216 , 218 , 220 .
- Content processor 206 groups together normalized items 260 , 262 , 264 into a collection, namely, normalized private content 212 .
- normalized private content 212 is sent to other modules in server 202 as a data feed, e.g., rather than individually sending normalized items 260 , 262 , 264 .
- Index Server 202 also includes an index generator 214 .
- Index generator 214 is configured to index private content 252 and to index public content 250 .
- Index generator 214 is also configured to update these indexes with new information, including new content and new information about restrictions (e.g., restricts) on access to the indexed content.
- Server 202 also includes search engine 215 for searching indexed private and public content.
- Search engine 215 may include, e.g., a crawling engine to crawl content, an indexing engine to index crawled content, and a ranking engine to rank content in the index (not shown).
- content processor 206 may be part of the crawling engine and index generator 214 may be part of the indexing engine of search engine 215 (as depicted graphically by the dotted line in FIG. 2 ).
- content processor 206 and index generator are separate from, e.g., outside of, search engine 215 .
- index generator 214 generates private content index 226 , which indexes private content 252 .
- index generator 214 uses normalized items 260 , 262 , 264 , index generator 214 generates corresponding index items, e.g. 228 , and stores the index items in private content index 226 .
- Each indexed item includes a content identifier 230 and an ACL 232 .
- Content identifier 230 includes, e.g., portions of an item of private content that index generator 214 has determined are relevant for identifying and/or for searching the item of private content, information describing the item, keywords for the item, and/or a unique identifier for the item.
- An ACL e.g. 232
- the ACL includes searcher restricts identifying entities who are authorized to access the corresponding item of content (here, 228 ) and/or group restrict(s) identifying groups of entities who are authorized to access the corresponding item of content.
- index generator 214 identifies users and groups that are permitted to access corresponding content items in the search index. This information may be obtained, e.g., from the items themselves or from accounts or other information that are accessible, e.g. on a social networking service. For example, a sender of a content item is typically permitted future access to that content item. Likewise, a group of entities associated with a same account of a social networking service may be permitted access to the same information.
- Index generator 214 incorporates the appropriate individual and/or group restricts into ACL 232 .
- Items 216 , 218 , 220 of private content 252 may include sensitive and/or confidential information (collectively referred to herein as confidential information, without limitation, for purposes of convenience).
- item 216 includes such confidential information.
- index generator 214 When generating content identifier 230 of index item 228 , index generator 214 includes at least a portion of the confidential information in content identifier 230 . To promote secure storage of the confidential information in index item 228 , index generator 214 may encrypt content identifier 230 using an encryption key, namely, key 242 .
- search engine 215 Prior to including index item 228 in a search, search engine 215 may, optionally, determine that a user requesting the search is permitted access to confidential information in content identifier 230 .
- content identifier 230 of index item 228 may be associated with a wrapped key (not shown).
- a wrapped key includes an encrypted key.
- server 202 sends the wrapped key to another security system (not shown).
- the security system sends the unwrapped key to server 202 .
- the unwrapped key is used by search engine 215 to decrypt content identifier 230 .
- index generator 214 also generates public content index 234 for public content 250 , including, e.g., publicly accessible Web pages, publicly accessible Web sites, publicly accessible documents, and other publicly accessible information. Index generator 214 may generate public content index 234 by crawling the World Wide Web and indexing Web pages. Items of public content may have associated ACLs indicating, e.g., that there are no restrictions on access. In cases where access to public content is restricted, appropriate restricts may be incorporated into those ACLs. Alternatively, some Items of public content need not include ACLs.
- index generator 214 may generate a single index for indexing private content 252 and public content 250 , e.g., rather than generating separate indexes 226 and 234 .
- index generator 214 may generate individual private and public content indexes for users of system 200 , e.g., rather than generating private and public content indexes 226 and 234 , which may index private content 252 and public content 250 .
- index generator 214 generates an index (not shown) indexing items of private content that are accessible to a particular user.
- index generator 214 also generates another, different index (not shown) indexing items of public content that are also accessible to the particular user.
- system 200 also includes client device 204 .
- client device 204 Using client device 204 , a user (not shown), submits a search query 222 to server 202 .
- search query 222 includes one or more search terms. Appropriate searcher and/or group restricts are incorporated automatically into the search query, and are sent to the search engine along with the search query.
- Search engine 215 receives search query 222 .
- search engine 215 searches both private content index 226 and public content index 234 .
- search engine 215 determines which items 216 , 218 , 220 of private content 252 the user has permission to access.
- search query 222 includes a searcher restrict specifying an identity of the user submitting search query 222 , along with group restrict(s) for groups for which the user is a member, if existing.
- Search engine 215 scans ACLs of the index items in private content index 226 to determine which of items 216 , 218 , 220 of private content 252 are accessible to the user submitting search query 222 .
- items that are accessible to the user include those items having corresponding restricts (in their associated ACLs) that match the searcher restrict and the group restrict(s), if existing, in the user's search query.
- search engine 215 determines a relevancy of item 216 to search query 222 .
- search engine 215 determines a relevance score for item 216 using content identifier 230 and search terms included in search query 222 .
- a relevance score includes a measure of likelihood to be responsive to a search query.
- Search engine 215 may identify items 216 , 218 , 220 of private content 252 as relevant to search query 222 .
- Search engine 215 generates search results for items 216 , 218 , 220 .
- a search result includes information containing content from an item of information, e.g., a snippet, and a reference to a location of the item of information.
- a reference may include a link and/or a pointer from one item of information to another item of information.
- Search engine 215 also searches public content index 234 for items of public content 250 that may be relevant to search query 222 . For items of public content identified as relevant to search query 222 , search engine 215 also generates search results for the items of public content 250 .
- Search engine 215 generates search results 224 by combining search results for items of private content 252 with search results for items of public content 250 that are relevant to search query 222 .
- Search engine 215 ranks search results 224 in accordance with relevance of search results 224 to search query 222 , and sends the ranked search results 224 to client device 204 .

- Process 400 may be performed, e.g., by index generator 214 .
- Process 400 stores ( 401 ) electronic content in a search index.
- the electronic content may include index items, e.g. 228 , that correspond to received private content items.
- the electronic content may also include items of public content 250 .
- the public and private content items may be stored in a same search index or in different search indexes, as explained herein.
- Process 400 stores ( 402 ) an ACL, e.g. 232 , in association with, at least, each item of private content in the search index.
- access to private content items may be restricted for some entities (e.g., entities and groups).
- An ACL may include searcher restrict(s), which identify entities who are authorized to access the corresponding content item; and group restrict(s), which identify groups of entities that are authorized to access the corresponding content item. Search queries that do not have restricts that match these restricts in the ACL will not typically identify the associated content item.
- Process 400 modifies ( 403 ) ACLs in the search index based on one or more criteria in an attempt to achieve an appropriate relationship (e.g., balance) between search query complexity and search index complexity.
- process 400 may modify ( 403 ) the ACLs by expanding group restricts in the ACLs.
- expanding the group restricts can mean adding searcher restricts corresponding to the group restricts to the ACLs. This expansion process is explained below with respect to FIG. 5 .
- Process 400 may also modify ( 403 ) the ACLs to ensure that users will not perform searching using more than a specified number of group restricts. This process is explained below with respect to FIG. 6 .
- Process 400 refreshes (e.g., updates) ( 404 ) the search index following modification ( 403 ) of the ACLs. For example, process 400 makes updates to the search index that are necessitated by the expanded group restricts.
- Process 400 also updates ( 405 ) restrict tables for users to reflect changes to restricts in the search index. For example, process 400 may remove, from user restrict tables, group restricts that have been expanded.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart showing an example process for determining which restricts to modify in the search index.
- FIG. 5 shows a process 500 showing an example of how a search index can be modified ( 403 ) or generated.
- Process 500 may be performed, e.g., by index generator 214 .
- Process 500 identifies ( 501 ) a first group that has a specified number of entities or more than the specified number. For example, process 500 may consult a database, which may be stored in the search index or elsewhere, to identify which group restricts are for groups exceeding (e.g., having greater than or equal to) the specified number of entities. In this example, that number is between 50 and 250; however, the number may be selected manually or automatically to achieve an appropriate balance between search query complexity and search index complexity. For example, the number could be on the order of 10's, 100's, 1000's and so forth.
- process 500 assigns ( 502 ) a first group restrict for the first group to appropriate item(s) of electronic content in the search index.
- Members of the first group are authorized to access the electronic content so tagged with that group restrict.
- members of the group will have that group restrict added to their corresponding restrict table. For example, each time search index refreshes (e.g., the search index is updated to include new information), appropriate restricts are issued to the user (e.g., the restricts are associated with the user's online profile).
- a separate database may contain a list of groups of which entities are members. The system identifies members of groups and issues, to those members restrict tables, appropriate group restricts.
- process 500 may take no action. This is because the first group restrict is not expanded in the search index.
- Process 500 identifies ( 503 ) a second group that corresponds to a second group restrict in the search index. This second group is determined to have less than the specified number of entities. To identify the second group, process 500 may consult a database, which may be stored in the search index or elsewhere, to identify which group restricts are for groups having less than the specified number of entities. Since the second group has less than the specified number of entities, process 500 expands the second group in the search index. In this context, expanding the group restrict may include replacing the second group restrict with searcher restricts for members of the second group, or it may include augmenting the search index to include searcher restricts for members of the second group while leaving the second group restrict in the search index. In cases where the group restrict is replaced, the group restrict may effectively be eliminated from the search index, or at least from items of content in the search index to which searcher restricts for entities in the second group are assigned.
- Process 500 assigns ( 504 ) searcher restricts for entities in the second group to items of electronic content in the search index.
- the searcher restricts are added to the content item's corresponding ACL; however, other ways of assigning (also called “tagging”) the searcher restricts to the content item may be used.
- pointers or other data structures may be used to associate searcher restricts with corresponding content items.
- John is a member of a first group having 10 members.
- the number of entities in a group that would trigger expansion is 50 (e.g., groups with less than 50 members are expanded).
- John's restrict table includes, at minimum, John's searcher restrict and a first group restrict for the first group.
- the 10 members' searcher restricts including John's searcher restrict, are incorporated into appropriate ACLs in the search index. For example, at each instance where the group restrict is found, the 10 members' searcher restricts are added. Furthermore, the first group restrict is removed from Johns' restrict table.
- John's searcher restrict is retrieved from John's restrict table and is incorporated into his search query.
- the first group restrict is no longer in John's restrict table and is, therefore, not retrieved for incorporation into the search query. This will not affect the search results that John retrieves from the index, since John's searcher restrict is tagged to appropriate ACLs.
- electronic content corresponding to those ACLs will be identified as accessible to John through his searcher restrict. Thus, that content remains accessible to John without the group restrict that was expanded.
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart showing an example process for determining which restricts to modify in the search index.
- FIG. 6 shows a process 600 showing an example of how a search index can be modified ( 403 ) or generated.
- Process 600 may be performed, e.g., by index generator 214 .
- Process 600 identifies ( 601 ) first entities who are members a specified number of groups or less than that specified number of groups. For example, process 600 may consult a database, which may be stored in the search index or elsewhere, to identify those entities. In this example, that number is between 10 and 50; however, the number may be selected manually or automatically to achieve an appropriate balance between search query complexity and search index complexity. For example, the number could be on the order of 10's, 100's, 1000's and so forth
- process 600 assigns ( 602 ) first group restricts corresponding to the first entities to one or more items of electronic content in the search index. If the search index already includes the appropriate group restricts, and no updates or other modifications are necessary, process 600 may take no action at this point.
- Process 600 identifies ( 603 ) second entities who are members of more than the specified number of groups (e.g., members of more than, e.g., 10 groups).
- process 600 assigns ( 604 ) searcher restricts corresponding to the second entities to appropriate items of electronic content in the search index. For example, process 600 adds, to the ACL for each appropriate item of electronic content, a searcher restrict for each entity who is a member of more than, e.g., 10 groups.
- group restricts are not removed from the search index (since other members of the group, who are not members of more than, e.g., 10 groups, may still access the content through a group restrict).
- the second entities' restrict tables are updated to remove the corresponding group restricts. So, accessibility of content will be determined by searcher restrict, not group restrict. This process is advantageous in that it can reduce the number of group restricts that are transmitted with a search query for a category of users.
- the maximum number of groups to which a user may belong, and not trigger operation 604 may be 10.
- a searcher Jane
- ACLs containing group restricts for groups that Jane is a member of will also include, separately, Jane's searcher restrict.
- FIG. 7 shows an example of a search index modified in accordance with the process of FIG. 6 .
- Jane is a member of groups 1 and 3 .
- Restricts therefor are included in ACLs 701 , 703 and 704 , but not in ACLs 702 and 705 .
- Process 600 therefore incorporates Jane's searcher restrict into ACLs 701 , 703 and 704 , thereby enabling Jane to access the corresponding content items using her searcher restrict, and not requiring Jane to include the group restricts in the search query.
- Jane's restrict table will not be updated to include the group restricts for the 200 groups, or a portion thereof, of which Jane is a member. Accordingly, when Jane conducts a search, her searcher restrict (and not group restricts) will be used by the search engine to identify which content that Jane is permitted to access. Accordingly, in this example, process 600 reduces the number of group restricts that must be included in a search query.
- process 600 may only be performed to the extent that the number of groups exceeds the specified number.
- process 600 may only incorporate Jane's searcher restrict into ACLs that include group restricts for 190 of the groups, and not in the remaining ACLs, leaving her with group-based access to the remaining 10 groups. In this case, Jane's restrict table is modified accordingly.
- access to documents need not be limited by constructs, e.g., the restricts described herein. Rather, documents that match a query may be retrieved from a search index, and those documents may be filtered using one or more criteria that identify which documents that a user is permitted to access. A system similar to this may be used, for example, for smaller search indexes and/or in systems having sufficient parallel processing capabilities.
- a table or other data structure that represents documents having a certain property may be used to specify which entities have access to which electronic documents.
- data may include bits in an encryption key used to access the document.
- electronic content of a social network that can be accessed by its members can be tagged with appropriate restricts.
- blog posts messages (e-mail, text, tweets, posts), comments, images, video, audio, and more can be tagged.
- a group, to which a group restrict is assigned may be based on an entity's social graph information.
- a group may be defined based on a proximity to a node (e.g., an individual) in a social graph.
- entities having a direct connection to an entity may be grouped, entities within two nodes of an entity (e.g., an indirect relationship—a contact of a contact, for example) may be grouped and so on.
- Group restricts may be suggested on this basis.
- FIG. 8 is a conceptual view of an example of a social graph.
- FIG. 8 shows sources of information for a social graph.
- a user's social graph is a collection of connections (e.g., users, resources, etc.) identified as having a relationship to the user 802 within some degree of separation.
- the user's social graph can include people and particular content at different degrees of separation.
- the social graph of a user can include contacts, contacts of contacts (e.g., as defined by a user, social graphing site, or other metric), the user's social circle, people followed by the user (e.g., subscribed blogs, feeds, or Web sites), co-workers, and other specifically identified content of interest to the user (e.g., particular Web sites).
- Contact on a social graph may be direct or indirect.
- a direct connection may be unilateral or bilateral.
- Members of a social graph are not limited to people, but rather may include, e.g., companies, services, or other entities to which a connection can be made.
- Diagram 800 shows a user 802 and the different connections that are possible to extend the user's social graph to people and content both within a system and across one or more external networks.
- the user can have a profile or contacts list that includes a set of identified contacts, a set of links to external resources (e.g., Web pages), and subscriptions to content of a system (e.g., a system that provides various content and applications including e-mail, chat, video, photo albums, feeds, or blogs).
- a system e.g., a system that provides various content and applications including e-mail, chat, video, photo albums, feeds, or blogs.
- blogs that include links to a user's contacts may be part of the user's social graph.
- Each of these groups can be connected to other users or resources at another degree of separation from the user.
- contacts of the user each may have their own profile that includes links to resources as well as contacts of the respective contacts.
- a user may be connected to a social networking account. That social networking account may reference an article in a newspaper. A social connection, therefore, may be established between the user and the author of the article.
- the connections to a user within a specified number of degrees of separation can be considered the social graph of the user. Membership and degree of separation in the social graph may be based on other factors, including a frequency of interaction. For example, a frequency of interaction by the user may be, e.g., how often the user visits a particular social networking site) or a type of interaction may be, e.g., endorsing, selecting, or not selecting items associated with contacts. As interaction changes, the relationship of a particular contact in the social graph can also dynamically change. Thus, the social graph can be dynamic rather than static.
- Members of a social networking service or others can designate particular resources as endorsed, claim resources, share resources, quote URLs, or otherwise indicate an interest or liking of content, e.g., a particular resource, Web page, or search result.
- an application, widget, or scripting can be provided in search results pages, Web pages, or within a browser application that allows a user to indicate liking, sharing, or other evaluation of an associated resource or search result.
- the user can mark the particular resource, Web site, or search results to indicate endorsement or other evaluation (e.g., though a browser control or user interface element presented with the associated content).
