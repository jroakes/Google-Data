Definitions
- Computer systems employ various techniques in order to provide improved user interfaces.
- One such technique is the ability to receive various forms of input in addition to physical inputs such as those from a controller, keyboard, and/or mouse.
- a system may have the ability to receive a voice-based input.
- voice-based input often require the user to say specific keywords and commands, which may not be intuitive when communicating with the system.
- these systems may employ a delay before responding to a voice-based input in order to confirm that the user's intended command is completed. These delays, however, may be frustrating in instances where a user expects an immediate feedback. Accordingly, traditional voice-based input systems often provide an unsatisfying user experience.
- a computer-implemented method for a device to interpret a voice-based input may include detecting a presence of one or more users within a field-of-view of a capture device and receiving a speech command. The method may also include determining that a first user among the detected one or more users is a source of the received speech command based on detecting a first touchless gesture performed by the first user and determining one or more identities of the detected one or more users. In addition, the method may include disambiguating a word in the received speech command based on the determined one or more identities and performing an action based on the disambiguated speech command.
- a computer-implemented method for a device to interpret a voice-based input may include determining one or more identities of one or more users within a field-of-view of a capture device and receiving a speech command.
- the method may also include disambiguating a word in the received speech command based on the determined one or more identities and performing an action based on the disambiguated speech command.
- the device may be in communication with a microphone and a capture device and may include a processor.
- the processor may be configured to detect a presence of one or more users within a field-of-view of the capture device and receive, via the microphone, a speech command.
- the processor may also be configured to determine that a first user among the detected one or more users is a source of the received speech command based on detecting a first touchless gesture performed by the first user and determine one or more identities of the detected one or more users.
- the processor may be configured to disambiguate a word in the received speech command based on the determined one or more identities and perform an action based on the disambiguated speech command.

- FIG. 9 shows an example of a user providing a speech command that may be disambiguated according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter.
- the present disclosure improves a user interface by allowing the user to intuitively provide speech commands with the aid of gestures.
- the user may delimit the commencement and end of a command thereby allowing the system to provide an immediate response.
- gestures may be detected in order to determine a source of a provided speech command, and accordingly, user-specific actions may be performed based on the identity of the source.
- the system may disambiguate one or more words of the speech command.
- the system may disambiguate the word “my” based on the identity of the source of the command in order to open the appropriate calendar.
- the system may also disambiguate other personal pronouns of a speech command.
- a user may provide a speech command and a gesture pointing to another user.
- the system may disambiguate commands such as “him” or “her” by determining the user corresponding to “him” or “her” based on identifying the user that is referenced. Accordingly, the systems and techniques described herein provide an improved user experience by allowing the user to communicate using natural language techniques.

- gestures may be recognized based on information such as a distance of movement (either absolute or relative to the size of the user), a threshold velocity of the movement, a confidence rating, and other criteria.
- the criteria for detecting a gesture may vary between applications and between contexts of a single application including variance over time.
- the gesture may include movements within a three-dimensional environment, and accordingly, the gestures may include components of movement along one or more axes.

- FIG. 4 shows a flow diagram of a device interpreting a voice-based input according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter.
- the device may detect a presence of one or more users. Detecting may include the device performing the actual detection and/or the device receiving and indication that one or more users have been detected by the capture device. This may include determining whether one or more users are within a field-of-view of a capture device (e.g. capture device 19 ) and/or whether one or more users are within a general vicinity of the device (e.g. present within a room). Users may interact with the device actively (e.g. provide a speech command) or may be passive participants in an interaction (e.g. referenced by a speech command).
- a capture device e.g. capture device 19
- a general vicinity of the device e.g. present within a room.
- Users may interact with the device actively (e.g. provide a speech command) or may be passive participants in an interaction (e.g. referenced by a speech command).
- the device may detect a user (e.g. particular shapes that may correspond to a user) based on detecting motion (e.g. via a motion detector that may be part of or separate from the capture device), sound or a particular speech command, and/or another form of stimulus.
- the device may activate the capture device (if not already activated).
- the device may detect the presence of a user based on a speech input, and in response, the device may activate the capture device.
- the device may initiate gesture detection. As described above, gesture detection may track a position of a user or particular features (e.g.
- a field-of-view as described herein may include an area perceptible by one or more capture devices (e.g. perceptible visual area).
- a vicinity as described herein may include the field-of-view plus an additional area in which the device may presume the user is located. For example, a user that was in the field-of-view and temporarily moves outside the field-of-view (e.g. moves to another area of the room) may still be determined to be within the vicinity based on characteristics such as a timing threshold, detected audio input (e.g. a particular voice or speech command), and/or other characteristics.
- the device may determine one or more identities (e.g.
- the device may attempt to identify the one or more detected users within the field-of-view and remember (e.g. store) this information in order to interpret a subsequent speech command as described further herein.
- the device may attempt to identify the one or more detected users in response to receiving the speech command.
- the device may perform a recognition function only after receiving a speech command that may need to be disambiguated.
- the device may receive a speech command from a user.
- a speech command may include various forms of speech input and may be received via one or more microphones.
- a speech command may include any predefined “action” words and/or commands.
- the speech command may also include speech input for dictation purposes such as voice-to-text functions.
- the device may be configured to interpret a speech command and responsively perform one or more actions.
- the speech command may include “play video X,” and in response, the device may initiate a playback of video X.
- the device may be configured to interpret natural forms of language. For example, a user may wish to communicate with the device in a natural manner and by using everyday words and phrases.
- pronouns are words that may be substituted for nouns in a sentence.
- a personal pronoun may include the words as summarized below in Table 1.
- the personal pronoun may include a first, second, or third person pronoun, which may be subjective, objective, or possessive.
- these pronouns may be singular or plural.
- a singular first-person possessive pronoun includes “my,” or “mine.”
- a potentially ambiguous word as described herein may include any word or phrase in a speech command that may have one or more logical interpretations based on the use of the word in the command, and where it may not be possible to determine the intended interpretation without additional information such as a gesture.
- the word “that” may be potentially ambiguous because it is not clear from the command itself which file is intended to be opened by the user.
- the phrase “first photo” in the command “open the first photo in the set” may be potentially ambiguous in the context of a photo editing program that has access to multiple sets of photographs, where the user has not otherwise selected one of the sets.
- Other examples of potentially ambiguous words are provided herein.
- Implementations of the presently disclosed subject matter allow for disambiguation of such words without additional input from the user such as by determining user identities, and/or in conjunction with gestures that the user may perform while giving the command. Accordingly, a user interacting with the device may provide speech commands in a more natural manner.
- the device may determine that a first user among the detected one or more users is a source of the received speech command. By determining the source of the speech command, the device may determine additional contextual information in order to process the command. For example, as described above, multiple users may be within the field-of-view, and the device may determine a source of the speech command in order to disambiguate the speech command. This determination may be based on detecting that a first touchless gesture is performed by the first user.
- the performed gesture may include any detectable movement or a predefined input gesture.
- the device may provide a gesture interface and predefined gesture inputs may initiate commands (e.g. “open,” “play,” “sleep,” “share,” etc.).
- the detected gesture may be performed contemporaneously with the speech command.
- a contemporaneous gesture may include a gesture performed before, during, or after a speech command.
- a contemporaneous gesture performed before or after the speech command may be detected based on being performed within a predefined time threshold of the speech command. Such a threshold may be defined by a person of ordinary skill in the art such that the gesture may be presumed to be connected to the speech command and/or intended to provide context to the speech command.
- the detected gesture may provide parameters for a speech command such as delimiting parameters.
- the gesture may include a predefined gesture that initiates a speech command.
- FIG. 5 shows an example of a gesture delimiting the commencement of a speech command according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter.
- a raise hand gesture 50 may provide an indication of the commencement of a speech command. Accordingly, the device may begin “listening” for a speech command upon detection of such a gesture.
- the gesture initiating a speech command may be in addition to, or used as an alternative to, the use of a particular “hot word” such as “start,” “begin,” “activate,” etc.
- other gestures may be performed such as a raise finger gesture, or other gestures to provide an indication to the device to commence “listening” for a speech command (e.g. process the audio input that may be received from a microphone).
- a particular gesture may signal that the speech command is completed, and thus, provide an indication for the device to cease listening, or adjust the threshold at which the device recognizes a speech input (e.g. adjust a sensitivity of one or more microphones).
- FIG. 6 shows an example of a gesture delimiting the end of a speech command according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter.
- a lower hand gesture 60 (or hand lowering, drop hand, etc.) may provide an indication of the end of a speech commend.
- the device is immediately aware of the end of a command, and thus, may stop “listening” for a speech command. As a result, the device may be able to respond immediately to the intended speech command.
- This provides an improvement over traditional voice-based systems, which are susceptible to a user experience drawback based on the speed at which these systems may respond to a speech input. For example, traditional systems often delay or determine that a speech input is complete only after a certain time has elapsed.
- implementations described herein may improve the overall user experience by providing an efficient technique to accelerate the process of interpreting speech commands.
- the device may determine one or more identities of the detected one or more users by performing a recognition function.
- An identity of a user may include, for example, a user or a unique user account, both of which may be associated with user information. For example, this information may include a name, preferences, user history, demographic information, and other information that may be stored in association with a user account.
- a gesture may be detected and this gesture may also provide additional contextual information to identify a subject or an object that may be referenced in a speech command.
- the device may detect a referencing gesture supplementing a speech command (e.g. a gesture contemporaneous with a speech command).
- the device may detect a touchless gesture performed by a user that includes a pointing gesture to themselves, another user, or an object.
- a user may point to a device while providing a command that may include potentially ambiguous terms such as a subject or object (including an indirect object) of a sentence.
- a subject or object of the sentence may include a pronoun or a name.
- the first user may point to a second user and provide a speech command such as “share this picture with him.”
- the device may determine the second user being referenced and may determine the identity of the second user by performing a recognition function.
- identities of users may be determined before receiving the speech command. In such an instance, it may be determined which identity corresponds to the second user based on a position of the user (e.g. relative to the first user), or other suitable technique.
- FIG. 7 shows an example of a user providing a speech command and a gesture referencing a user according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter.
- the example in FIG. 7 includes three users John 70 , Stacy 72 , and Boris 74 within the field-of-view of the capture device.
- John 20 may provide a speech command and perform a pointing gesture referencing another user within a field-of-view of the capture device.
- the speech command may include a pronoun (e.g. “him”), and accordingly, the device may determine which user corresponds to “him,” based on the pointing gesture, which in this example is Boris 74 .
- a pronoun e.g. “him”
- FIG. 8 shows an example of a user providing a speech command and a gesture referencing an object according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter.
- a user may provide a speech command and contemporaneously point to an object.
- the device may identify the object and perform a corresponding action.
- the example in FIG. 8 includes an object, which in this case is a lamp 80 .
- the user 20 may point to the lamp 80 and provide the speech command “turn it on.”
- the device may send an instruction, through a network (e.g. wireless home network), for the lamp 80 to turn on.
- Speech commands may also include a subject of a sentence as the potentially ambiguous word.
- the above example may be applicable for scenarios in which the command includes “this,” that,” “those,” “these,” etc.
- the speech command may include “turn that on.”
- the user may include a name in the speech command and the device may determine which of the users corresponds to the name.
- FIG. 9 shows an example of a user providing a speech command that may be disambiguated according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter.
- John 70 may provide the speech command “share this picture with Stacy” without an accompanying gesture.
- the device may determine which of the users in the field-of-view (or vicinity) corresponds to Stacy.
- the device may identity Stacy 72 after determining the identities of the other user in the field-of-view (e.g. Boris 74 ).
- John 70 may provide the speech command “share this picture with everyone,” and in response, the device may share the picture to all other users within the field-of-view (or vicinity), which in this case would include Stacy 72 and Boris 74 . Similar terms such as “everybody,” “everything,” “all,” etc. may also be used.
- the device may account for the number of users within the room. For example, in a situation where only John 70 and Stacy 72 are within a field-of-view, the device in response to John's command “forward this email to her,” may deduct that “her” refers to Stacy since she is the only other user detected within the field-of-view. It should be noted that it may not be necessary for the user to remain within the field-of-view of the capture device when the device performs an action. For example, the device may remember if one or more users were within the field-of-view of the capture device in order to determine contextual information.
- a speech command such as “share with everyone” may include users that may not be currently within the field-of-view, but may be within a vicinity (e.g. within the same room or venue).
- the field-of-view may include the field-of-views of multiple capture devices.
- capture devices may be positioned in various rooms, and accordingly, the field-of-view may encompass these various rooms.
- the device may perform a recognition function.
- the recognition function may include any suitable techniques such as facial recognition and/or voice recognition.
- facial recognition known techniques may be used including methods that recognize a face based on a shape, skin color, relative positioning of facial features, etc.
- voice recognition known techniques may be used such as determining whether a “voiceprint” or a template of the voice matches stored voice information associated with a user.
- the device may determine one or more identities of one or more users in response to receiving the speech command. Accordingly, in such a situation, the recognition may be in response to the substance of the speech command. For example, the device may perform the recognition function in response to a potentially ambiguous speech command. Accordingly, in an implementation, the device may only perform the recognition function when necessary for disambiguation.
- this information may be stored on the device or may be accessed from a remote source. For example, the device may communicate with a server (e.g. server 20 ) to retrieve identity information (e.g. user information such as name, preferences, etc.) when determining a user identity.
- identity information e.g. user information such as name, preferences, etc.
- the device may disambiguate a portion of the received speech command based on the determined one or more identities.
- disambiguating is defined broadly to include providing additional information and/or context to a word, and accordingly, may involve determining a precise (or more precise) meaning for one or more words in a speech input.
- the device may disambiguate a subject (e.g. a personal pronoun), an object (e.g. a component in communication with the device), and/or other words of a speech command.
- the device may perform an action based on the disambiguated speech command.
- the device may perform (e.g. execute) various actions that may control the device.
- Particular “action” words may be predefined by a voice-based interface for the device.
- action words may include, but are not limited to, words related to control of the device (e.g., turn on or off, louder, softer, increase, decrease, mute, output, clear, erase, brighten, darken, etc.), communications (e.g., e-mail, mail, call, contact, send, receive, get, post, tweet, text, etc.), document processing (e.g., open, load, close, edit, save, undo, replace, delete, insert, format, etc.), searches (e.g., find, search, look for, locate, etc.), content delivery (e.g., show, play, display), and/or other action words.
- words related to control of the device e.g., turn on or off, louder, softer, increase, decrease, mute, output, clear, erase, brighten, darken, etc.
- communications e.g., e-mail, mail, call, contact, send, receive, get, post, tweet, text, etc.
- document processing e.g.
- the system may provide users with the ability to control and/or set preferences related to the collection of such data.
- certain information may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored and/or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user may be provided with the option to remain anonymous or not be identified through a recognition function as described herein.
- implementations may include or be embodied in the form of computer-implemented process and an apparatus for practicing that process.
- Implementations may also be embodied in the form of a computer-readable storage containing instructions embodied in a non-transitory and tangible storage and/or memory, wherein, when the instructions are loaded into and executed by a computer (or processor), the computer becomes an apparatus for practicing implementations of the disclosed subject matter.
- references to “one implementation,” “an implementation,” “an example implementation,” and the like, indicate that the implementation described may include a particular feature, but every implementation may not necessarily include the feature. Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same implementation. Further, when a particular feature is described in connection with an implementation, such feature may be included in other implementations whether or not explicitly described.
- the term “substantially” may be used herein in association with a claim recitation and may be interpreted as “as nearly as practicable,” “within technical limitations,” and the like. Terms such as first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, and these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms may be used distinguish one element from another. For example, a first gesture may be termed a second gesture, and, similarly, a second gesture may be termed a first gesture.
