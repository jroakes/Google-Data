- wearable computing devices described herein such as wearable computing device 110 of FIG. 1 , wearable computing device 210 of FIG. 2 and/or wearable computing device 710 of FIG. 7 may, in some embodiments, be head-mounted eyeglasses devices, also referred to as wearable heads-up displays or head-mounted displays.
- a head-mounted display is an electronic device that is worn on a user's head and, when so worn, secures at least one electronic display within a viewable field of at least one of the user's eyes, regardless of the position or orientation of the user's head.
- a wearable heads-up display is a head-mounted display that enables the user to see displayed content but also does not prevent the user from being able to see their external environment. Examples of wearable heads-up displays include: the Google Glass®, the Optinvent Ora®, the Epson Moverio®, and the Microsoft Hololens® just to name a few.
- a wearable heads-up display is an important factor in its design. When it comes to face-worn devices, however, users also care a lot about aesthetics. This is clearly highlighted by the immensity of the eyeglass (including sunglass) frame industry. Independent of their performance limitations, many of the aforementioned examples of wearable heads-up displays have struggled to find traction in consumer markets because, at least in part, they lack fashion appeal. Most wearable heads-up displays presented to date are bulky to enable adequate display performance and, as a result, appear very unnatural on a user's face compared to the sleeker and streamlined look of typical eyeglass and sunglass lenses.
- a traditional eyeglasses frame is problematic when correct alignment of optical components carried by the eyeglasses frame is a necessity for a high quality display. Because traditional eyeglasses have hinges where the arms meet the rest of the frame, any optical components carried on the arms may move relative to the rest of the frame or to the eye of the user while being worn, resulting in loss of or distortion of the display. There is a need in the art for means to successfully integrate electronic components into smaller frames in order to achieve the inconspicuous form factor and fashion appeal expected of the eyeglass frame industry while still maintaining a high display quality.
- the design form factor and location of an antenna within an electronic device is important because the location of the antenna relative to other components, both electronic and non-electronic, within the device impacts the functionality of the antenna. In some cases, interference from other components within the device significantly reduces the range, signal strength, and overall connectivity capabilities of the antenna, thus preventing the antenna from effectively connecting or communicating with other electronic devices. In many cases, a similar result occurs depending on the distance and orientation of the antenna relative to an external device with which the antenna is communicating.
- a wearable heads-up display may be provided in the form of eyeglasses frames and eyeglasses frames assemblies carrying an antenna for inter-device connectivity.
- Such glasses may include a minimal form factor that is aesthetically pleasing and an antenna design that enables superior range, signal strength, and overall connectivity capabilities of the antenna.

Abstract
Description
- This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/740176, filed 2 Oct. 2018, the content of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.
- The present systems, devices, and methods generally relate to wearable computing devices capable of network communications.
- Electronic devices are commonplace throughout most of the world today. Advancements in integrated circuit technology have enabled the development of electronic devices that are sufficiently small and lightweight to be carried by the user. Such “portable” electronic devices may include on-board power supplies (such as batteries or other power storage systems) and may be “wireless” (i.e., designed to operate without any wire-connections to other, non-portable electronic systems); however, a small and lightweight electronic device may still be considered portable even if it includes a wire-connection to a non-portable electronic system. For example, a microphone may be considered a portable electronic device whether it is operated wirelessly or through a wire-connection.
- The convenience afforded by the portability of electronic devices has fostered a huge industry. Smartphones, audio players, laptop computers, tablet computers, and e-book readers are all examples of portable electronic devices. However, the convenience of being able to carry a portable electronic device has also introduced the inconvenience of encumbering the user's hands with the device itself. This problem is addressed by making an electronic device not only portable, but wearable.
- A wearable electronic device is any portable electronic device that a user can carry without physically grasping, clutching, or otherwise holding onto the device with their hands. For example, a wearable electronic device may be attached or coupled to the user by a strap or straps, a band or bands, a clip or clips, an adhesive, a pin and clasp, an article of clothing, tension or elastic support, an interference fit, an ergonomic form, etc. Examples of wearable electronic devices include digital wristwatches, electronic armbands, electronic rings, electronic ankle-bracelets or “anklets,” head-mounted electronic display units, hearing aids, and so on.
- Because they are worn on the body of the user, visible to others, and generally present for long periods of time, form factor (i.e., size, geometry, and appearance) is a major design consideration in wearable electronic devices.

FIG. 7 , there is illustrated a schematic block diagram of an example delegated network access system for a wearable device.System 700 generally has awearable computing device 710—which may be an implementation ofwearable computing device 110 ofFIG. 1 orwearable computing device 210 ofFIG. 2 , with a platform architecture as described with reference toFIG. 6A —and ahost computing device 740—which may be an implementation ofhost computing device 140 ofFIG. 1 orhost computing device 440 ofFIG. 4 , with a platform architecture as described with reference toFIG. 6B . - Since
wearable computing device 710 is equipped with only a personal area network interface, software programs executed bywearable computing device 710 that desire data communications (e.g., with remote computing device 180) may create data packets using a specialized communications library, also called a companion service library, which allows for initial transmission of data via the personal area network interface to thehost computing device 740; thehost computing device 740 can receive these data transmissions and, using the companion service library, re-transmit them to the network on behalf of thewearable computing device 710. Likewise,host computing device 740 can receive transmissions from the network for delivery towearable computing device 710. -
Wearable computing device 710 may have acontroller device 720, such ascontroller device 120 ofFIG. 1 . Similarly,host computing device 740 may connect to anetwork 760, such asnetwork 160 ofFIG. 1 , and aremote computing device 780, such asremote computing device 180 ofFIG. 1 . -
Host computing device 740 can provide a number of services that are executed by a processor of thehost computing device 740. In particular,host computing device 740 may have a host personalarea network service 750, ahost routing service 755, and anetwork service 785.Host computing device 740 may also have a variety of other applications and services, shown here as 795 and described elsewhere herein. - The
host routing service 755 operates to receive data from the host personalarea network service 750, decode or de-encapsulate the data, determine a destination on a network, format or encapsulate the data for transmission via the network, and forward the encapsulated data to thenetwork service 785 for eventual transmission via the network. - Similarly, the
host routing service 755 operates to receive “reply” data fromnetwork service 785, decode or de-encapsulate the reply data, determine a destination on the personal area network, format or encapsulate the reply data for transmission via the personal area network, and forward the encapsulated reply data to the host personalarea network service 750 for eventual transmission via the personal area network.Data routing service 730 ofwearable computing device 710 may, upon receiving the reply data, determine which application or service is the intended recipient and forward the reply data accordingly. - Generally,
host routing service 755 may implement a host data communications endpoint by calling functions from the companion service library to handle data routing to or from the host device. As noted above, a corresponding companion service library may also be used by the client data communications endpoint inapplication 724 orproxy service 726. Adata routing service 730 ofwearable computing device 710 may also make use of the companion service library. - Generally, the companion service library may have related server and client libraries.
- The client library may have of a set of APIs and functions that act as an abstraction layer for a subset of the common Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) networking functions. Specifically, the client library may provide APIs and functions for creating, binding, opening and closing TCP sockets, as well as performing Domain Name System (DNS) queries and domain name resolution. Using the client library functions, the abstracted, open, TCP connections can be emulated with local UNIX domain sockets, which are functionally equivalent at the application layer.
- The server library may have a set of APIs, functions and callbacks that can be used to provide a server thread to autonomously manage the connection lifecycle and communications between the various applications or proxy servers that implement client data communication endpoints, and the
data routing service 730, which integrates with the server library. The API of the server library facilitates client remote procedure call (RPC) calls for TCP socket operations, as requested by the clients. The callbacks and callouts allow thedata routing service 730 to frame RPC requests and socket data when sending it to thehost computing device 740, and de-frame command responses and socket data coming from thehost computing device 740 before returning it to the client application via the companion service library functions. - In the case of
data routing service 730, the server library API functions may be used to frame or de-frame client RPC calls using a protocol buffer messaging protocol, which can be common to both thewearable computing device 710 andhost computing device 740. - Host personal
area network service 750 operates to receive and transmit data over the wireless interface (e.g.,wireless communication interface 441 of host computing device 440) and betweenhost routing service 755 and other applications and services ofhost computing device 740. In particular, host personalarea network service 750 may communicate with a personalarea network service 735 ofwearable computing device 710 via a general personal area network (e.g., Bluetooth™) or over a low-power personal area network (e.g., Bluetooth™ LE), or both. In some cases, the personal area network service determines which of the general personal area network and low-power personal area network to use for each data packet it transmits, based on a type of the data packet or a session type. - Similarly,
network service 785 operates to receive and transmit data over the network interface (e.g.,communication interface 445 of host computing device 440) and betweenhost routing service 755 and other applications and services ofhost computing device 740. - As noted,
wearable computing device 710 has a personalarea network service 735, adata routing service 730, anapplication 724 and aproxy service 726. -
Application 724 may be a software application that is interactive and therefore makes use of a framework such as Qt, and implements a client data communications endpoint for networked communication viahost computing device 740. In particular, the client data communications endpoint allows the application to exchange one or more data messages withdata routing service 730 for eventual transmission (or reception) viahost computing device 740. - In some cases, the wearable computing device may be provided with applications or
frameworks 725 that are not configured or programmed to directly make use of a client data communications endpoint. For example, theapplications 725 may be legacy applications or provided by a third-party, and therefore are not configured to take advantage of the client data communications endpoint. In such cases, aproxy service 726 may be provided.Proxy service 726 can be a system service of the wearable computing device that has an instance of the client data communications endpoint (CSL), coupled with a proxy server implementation, which may be bound to a local domain socket. The proxy server implementation may be, for example, an HTTP 1.1 CONNECT method proxy. Accordingly,proxy server 726 implements a client data communications endpoint for networked communication viahost computing device 740. In particular, the client data communications endpoint allows certain applications to exchange one or more data messages withdata routing service 730 for eventual transmission (or reception) viahost computing device 740, even when the application itself is not specifically configured for the client data communications endpoint. - In operation, an application or framework can be configured to use the proxy server to connect to the locally-bound
proxy service 726. This allows the application or framework establish an HTTP tunnel, or a secure HTTPS tunnel, to thenetwork 160, viadata routing service 750, while abstracting all details of the wearable computing device's PAN and client data communications endpoint away from the application. -
Data routing service 730 implements functions from the communications library to provide an intermediate communications node that receives the one or more data messages from the client data communications endpoint, encapsulates the one or more data messages, and routes the one or more data messages to the host data communications endpoint ofhost routing service 755 via the personalarea network service 735, or vice versa. - The client data communications endpoint may implement a socket interface, such as local UNIX domain sockets or TCP sockets or, in at least some embodiments, a hybrid socket interface that allows for both local UNIX domain sockets and/or TCP sockets in a single interface.
- The host data communications endpoint may implement a corresponding socket interface, enabling sockets opened by an
application program 724 orproxy service 726 ofwearable computing device 710 to have endpoints onwearable computing device 710 andhost computing device 740. - Personal
area network service 735 interacts with a wireless communication interface to communicatively couple the data routing service and the host routing service via a general or low-power personal area network. The general PAN may be, for example, a Bluetooth™ PAN. The low-power PAN may be, for example, a Bluetooth™ LE PAN. -
Controller device 720 is generally capable of communicating with thewearable computing device 710 via a low-power personal area network. Personalarea network service 735 receives one or more control messages from thecontroller device 720 via the low-power personal area network and relays the one or more control messages to the data routing service, which can transmit the one or more control messages to an application program or service, where it can be interpreted as input. - As described elsewhere herein, the host computing device can assist the wearable computing device to communicate over a network, such as the Internet, by routing communications received over a personal area network to the network, and vice versa.
- However, in some cases, the personal area network connection for some devices may be periodic or time-limited. For example, the host computing device, or the wearable computing device, or both, may periodically disable their personal area network interfaces, e.g., to conserve battery.
- In some cases, the operating system of the host computing device may force disablement of the personal area network interface, for example, because of restrictions on the host communications service. In such cases, the wearable computing device may attempt to establish personal area network connection by taking advantage of a low-power personal area network, which may be more readily available. However, in many cases, the low-power personal area network may not be suitable for sustained connections and data transmission due to, e.g., lower data rates than a general personal area network connection. At least some of the described embodiments illustrate methods for allowing the wearable computing device to first initiate a low-power personal area network link, and then use this link to call for the host computing device to enable its general personal area network interface for subsequent linking.

FIGS. 8A to 8C , there are illustrated simplified process flow diagrams for methods of wirelessly coupling a wearable computing device to a host computing device. Methods 800 a, 800 b, and 800 c may be performed by a host computing device, such ashost computing device 140 ofsystem 100 depicted inFIG. 1 orhost computing device 440 ofFIG. 4 , and a wearable computing device, such aswearable computing device 110 ofsystem 100 depicted inFIG. 1 orwearable computing device 210 ofFIG. 2 . - As described elsewhere herein, the host computing device generally has a host processor, a host memory and at least one host wireless communication interface. The host wireless communication interface is generally capable of communication via a low-power personal area network, a general personal area network, or both. The host processor can be configured to carry out portions of the methods 800 a, 800 b, and 800 c depicted as being performed by the host computing device.
- Likewise, and as described elsewhere herein, the wearable computing device generally has a device processor, a device memory and at least one device wireless communication interface. The device wireless communication interface is generally capable of communication via the low-power personal area network, the general personal area network, or both. The device processor configured to carry out portions of the methods 800 a, 800 b, and 800 c depicted as being performed by the wearable computing device.
- In at least some implementations or embodiments, wireless coupling may be a multi-stage process. For example, in an iOS device, wireless coupling may involve a pre-authorization stage that occurs via a low-power personal area network, such as method 800 a. Method 800 a begins at 802, with the host computing device entering a mode in which it listens on one or both of its personal area network interfaces (e.g., general and low-power) for advertisement packets.
- At 804, the wearable computing device transmits an advertisement packet on the low-power personal area network, such as a Bluetooth™ LE personal area network. In some cases, the wearable computing device may periodically and repeatedly transmit the advertisement packet. In some embodiments, the advertisement packet may contain a Generic Access Profile (GAP) as defined by the Bluetooth™ LE protocol. In at least some implementations or embodiments, the advertisement packet may define the services of a device to which the wearable computing device wishes to connect (e.g., a mobile handset that supports delegated communications), and may contain a request for the recipient device to initiate the further coupling process.
- At 806, the host computing device receives the transmitted advertisement packet via the low-power personal area network and processes the advertisement packet to determine that it can offer the requested services.
- In response to the advertisement packet, at 808, the host computing device transmits a connection attempt packet to the wearable computing device. In some cases, the host computing device may first attempt to determine if a connection strength is above a connection strength threshold (e.g., to determine if the wearable computing device is “close enough”) prior to transmitting the connection attempt packet. In some cases, the host computing device may also first prompt a user to confirm whether to proceed with transmitting the connection attempt packet (e.g., so that the user can confirm that the wearable computing device belongs to the user).
- At 810, the wearable computing device receives the connection attempt packet and, optionally, ceases transmission of further advertisement packets for the duration of the low-power personal area network connection, or if a general personal area network connection is later established, for the duration of the general personal area network connection.
- At 812, the wearable computing device confirms that the connection attempt was successful by transmitting a success message to the host computing device.
- At 814, the host computing device receives the success message.
- In some cases, the exchange of connection attempt confirmations and success messages may be referred to as pre-pairing (or in some cases, simply pairing) via the low-power personal area network.
- At 816, the wearable computing device initiates service discovery by transmitting a request to the host computing device.
- The wearable computing device receives the request at 818 and transmits a services list to the host computing device in response.
- At 820, the wearable computing device registers for notifications from the host computing device and, at 822, the host computing device receives the registration request and processes it to begin notifying the wearable computing device of characteristic updates.
- At 824, the host computing device determines that a characteristic has been updated (or sends an initial characteristic or characteristics), and transmits a characteristics notification to the wearable computing device. Characteristics may be considered as, for example, containers for user data, also referred to as attributes, which are stored and maintained as part of the services offered by the host computing device.
- The wearable computing device receives the characteristics at 826 and processes them as needed. In some cases, the wearable computing device may wish to write characteristics, in which case it may do so by transmitting a write characteristics message to the host computing device in response, at 828. The host computing device receives and processes the characteristics list at 830.
- The wearable computing device may return to 820, and the host computing device may return to 822, as additional characteristics are read and written. Characteristic reading and writing may be used to carry out a pre-authorization routine, which can be a prelude to establishing a general personal area network connection.
- Upon completion of the pre-authorization routine, in which the wearable computing device may obtain the necessary keys and authorizations to continue with establishing a personal area network connection, the wearable computing device and the host computing device may switch to a general personal area network coupling method, as shown in
FIG. 8B orFIG. 8C . - In some embodiments, the wearable computing device may write a characteristic that can be used to call and activate an application program resident on the host computing device. The application program, when called, may activate the general personal area network interface and place it into a pairing ready mode.
- Following execution of method 800a, the wearable computing device and host computing device are coupled via a low-power personal area network and ready for pairing via a general personal area network. The wearable computing device and host computing device may initiate pairing via the general personal area network, such as a Bluetooth™ personal area network (as distinguished from Bluetooth™ LE), and as described further in method 800 b or 800 c.
- Referring now specifically to
FIG. 8B , this is illustrated a process flow diagram of an example method of continuing method 800 a ofFIG. 8A . The wearable computing device continues from node A of method 800 a, and the host computing device continues from node B of method 800 a. - At 840, the wearable computing device activates its general personal area network interface, if it is not already active. Likewise, at 842, the host computing device activates its general personal area network interface, if it is not already active. In some embodiments, the wireless coupling between the wearable computing device and host computing device may begin at this stage, i.e., without the pre-authorization of method 800 a. For example, in host computing devices that use the Android operating system, the wireless coupling may begin directly with Bluetooth Classic connection.
- At 844, the wearable computing device attempts to establish a link with the host computing device via the general personal area network. At 846, the link is established with the host computing device.
- At 848, the wearable computing device attempts to establish a channel via the previously established link. At 850, the channel is established.
- In response to establishment of the channel, the host computing device may request a services list at 852. The wearable computing device receives the request at 854 and processes the request.
- At 856, the wearable computing device transmits a services list in response to the services list request, which is received by the host computing device at 858.
- In some cases, such as when the host computing device uses the Android operating system, the wearable computing device and host computing device may be fully coupled or paired at this stage, and may begin to exchange data, at 860 and 862, according to the services agreed upon previously.
- In some other cases, such as when the host computing device uses the iOS operating system, further acts may be used to complete wireless coupling. In such cases, the host computing device may write a protected characteristic at 859, which may be received and read at 861. The wearable computing device may begin a bonding key exchange at 863, with the host computing device completing the key exchange at 865. Thereafter, the wearable computing device may repeat acts 841 (i.e., 844 to 856) using the newly acquired keys. Similarly, the host computing device may repeat acts 843 (i.e., 846 to 858) to complete pairing and begin exchanging data at 860 and 862.

In some embodiments, the wireless coupling between the wearable computing device and host computing device may begin at this stage, i.e., without the pre-authorization of method 800 a. For example, in host computing devices that use the Android operating system, the wireless coupling may begin directly with Bluetooth Classic connection.

FIGS. 9A and 9B , there are illustrated a simplified process flow diagram of a method of facilitating communication between a wearable computing device and a remote network via a host computing device connected to the remote network. Methods 900a and 900b may be performed by a host computing device, such ashost computing device 740 ofsystem 700 depicted inFIG. 7 , and a wearable computing device, such aswearable computing device 710 ofsystem 700 depicted inFIG. 7 . - As described elsewhere herein, the host computing device generally has a host processor, a host memory and at least one host wireless communication interface. The host wireless communication interface is generally capable of communication via a low-power personal area network, a general personal area network, or both. As described herein, the host computing device may execute a host routing service which provides a host data communications endpoint. The host processor can be configured to carry out portions of the methods 900 a and 900 b depicted as being performed by the host computing device.
- Likewise, and as described elsewhere herein, the wearable computing device generally has a device processor, a device memory and at least one device wireless communication interface. As described herein, the wearable computing device may execute a data routing service, and may execute application programs which interface with a client data communications endpoint. The device wireless communication interface is generally capable of communication via the low-power personal area network, the general personal area network, or both. The device processor configured to carry out portions of the methods 900 a and 900 b depicted as being performed by the wearable computing device.
- Method 900 a begins with the wearable computing device providing the client data communications endpoint at 902 and data routing service at 904. Similarly, the host computing device provides the host data communications endpoint at 906 and host routing service at 908.
- At 910, the host computing device receives a data packet from the network and forwards the data to the host routing service. The data packet may be formatted according to an Internet Protocol.
- At 912, the host routing service analyzes the data packet and determines that the destination of the packet is the wearable computing device.
- In response, at 914, the host routing service encapsulates the packet using a transport protocol and addresses the encapsulated packet to the wearable computing device. When encapsulating, each packet may be associated with a connection identifier, which can be unique for each discrete socket that is accessing the physical channel. In this way, packets can be transmitted and received for multiple discrete sockets concurrently, while still being delivered over a single physical channel. In some cases, encapsulation may be performed using Google Protocol buffers. However, in some cases, the transport protocol may enable the transmission of arbitrary data outside of Protocol buffer messages, which can facilitate companion service library operation.
- At 916, the host routing service transmits the encapsulated packet to the host personal area network service, which transmits the encapsulated packet to a counterpart service of the wearable computing device via the personal area network.
- At 930, the personal area network service of the wearable computing device receives the encapsulated packet and forwards it to the data routing service.
- At 932, the data routing service de-encapsulates the packet and determines a local destination.
- At 940, the wearable computing device determines the destination application (or proxy service) for the de-encapsulated packet and, at 942, the de-encapsulated packet is forwarded to the destination. Finally, upon receiving the de-encapsulated packet, the companion service library of the destination application can then deliver the packet to the local destination at 944. Generally, the local destination is an application program that can receive the data packet and process it as desired.
- Method 900 a may be performed substantially in reverse when the direction of data transmission is from the wearable computing device to the network.
- Method 900 b begins with the wearable computing device providing the client data communications endpoint at 902 and data routing service at 904. Similarly, the host computing device provides the host data communications endpoint at 906 and host routing service at 908.
- At 950, an application program executed by the wearable computing device generates a data packet and interfaces with a client data communications endpoint to transmit the packet.
- At 952, the data packet is transmitted to the data routing service, which determines a destination for the data packet at 954. The data routing service can, in some cases, use a priority queuing mechanism to allow for certain types of data traffic to be given priority over less important traffic. For example, over-the-air software updates or analytics data may be given lower priority than real-time navigation data.
- At 956, the data routing service encapsulates the packet in a transport protocol and forwards the encapsulated packet to the wearable computing device personal area network service at 958.
- At 960, the personal area network service transmits the encapsulated packet to the host computing device, via the personal area network.
- At 962, the personal area network service of the host computing device receives the encapsulated packet. The encapsulated packet is de-encapsulated by the host routing service at 964 and its network destination is determined.
- Optionally, at 966, the packet may be formatted according to an Internet Protocol, if it is not already so formatted.
- At 968, the packet is forwarded to a network service, where it is then transmitted via the communications interface to the network and its eventual destination, such as a remote computing device.
- Method 900 b may be performed substantially in reverse when the direction of data transmission is from the wearable computing device to the network.
- The client data communications endpoint and the host data communications endpoint described herein each may be implementations of a client-side and a host-side socket interface, respectively. Both socket interfaces may be implementations of Unix-style sockets, Internet sockets, or both.

FIG. 10A , shown therein is a perspective view of aring body member 1002 of a controller device, such ascontroller device 120, according to one embodiment. Thering body member 1002 can be worn around a user's finger. The shape of thering body member 1002 is shown for illustrative purposes and is not limited to the illustrated shape. Other shapes can be used. For example, thering body member 1002 can have a general shape of a circular band, a helix, or a spiral. Thering body member 1002 can have any appropriate shape that allows the ring body member to remain positioned around the user's finger. - A

FIGS. 10B and 10C , shown therein is a perspective view and a block diagram representation of anelectronic circuit 1010 housed within thering body member 1002 shown inFIG. 10A , according to one embodiment. - In some implementations or embodiments, the
electronic circuit 1010 shown inFIGS. 10A and 10B can be mounted on a flexible printed circuit board (PCB) 1012. In some embodiments, some or all of theelectronic circuit 1010 can be mounted on a reinforcement member for increasing the stiffness of the apparatus. For example, the reinforcement member can be formed of a metallic material. - The
electronic circuit 1010 can include acommunication interface 1040, afirst arm 1020 and asecond arm 1050 of a radiofrequency antenna. When thecommunication interface 1040 is located between thefirst arm 1020 and thesecond arm 1050, causing a disconnect between thefirst arm 1020 and thesecond arm 1050, the electronic circuit can form a dipole antenna. Thefirst arm 1020 is connected to anRF feed 1030. Thesecond arm 1050 includes aground patch 1052 mounted on aground plane surface 1054. That is, thesecond arm 1050 is connected to ground. - The
communication interface 1040 can be facilitate communication via a communication network. Thecommunication interface 1040 can be a Bluetooth™ Low Energy chip having a signal frequency of about 2400 MHz to about 2500 MHz.

In some embodiments, the harvester unit can harvest energy from direct impact. In some embodiments, the harvester unit can harvest energy from vibrations. In some embodiments, the harvester unit can be an electrodynamic harvester unit. The additional electronic components can also include an AC-DC converter (not shown). The additional

wearable computing device 110 ofFIG. 1 ,wearable computing device 210 ofFIG. 2 and/orwearable computing device 710 ofFIG. 7 may, in some embodiments, be head-mounted eyeglasses devices, also referred to as wearable heads-up displays or head-mounted displays. - A head-mounted display is an electronic device that is worn on a user's head and, when so worn, secures at least one electronic display within a viewable field of at least one of the user's eyes, regardless of the position or orientation of the user's head. A wearable heads-up display is a head-mounted display that enables the user to see displayed content but also does not prevent the user from being able to see their external environment. Examples of wearable heads-up displays include: the Google Glass®, the Optinvent Ora®, the Epson Moverio®, and the Microsoft Hololens® just to name a few.
- The optical performance of a wearable heads-up display is an important factor in its design. When it comes to face-worn devices, however, users also care a lot about aesthetics. This is clearly highlighted by the immensity of the eyeglass (including sunglass) frame industry. Independent of their performance limitations, many of the aforementioned examples of wearable heads-up displays have struggled to find traction in consumer markets because, at least in part, they lack fashion appeal. Most wearable heads-up displays presented to date are bulky to enable adequate display performance and, as a result, appear very unnatural on a user's face compared to the sleeker and streamlined look of typical eyeglass and sunglass lenses. However, a traditional eyeglasses frame is problematic when correct alignment of optical components carried by the eyeglasses frame is a necessity for a high quality display. Because traditional eyeglasses have hinges where the arms meet the rest of the frame, any optical components carried on the arms may move relative to the rest of the frame or to the eye of the user while being worn, resulting in loss of or distortion of the display. There is a need in the art for means to successfully integrate electronic components into smaller frames in order to achieve the inconspicuous form factor and fashion appeal expected of the eyeglass frame industry while still maintaining a high display quality.
- Another important factor in the design of electronic devices, including wearable heads-up displays, is the integration of components that allow for communication between devices. Examples of systems that integrate such inter-device connectivity are smart phones, watches, and headphones with Bluetooth® radio antennas. However, the design form factor and location of an antenna within an electronic device is important because the location of the antenna relative to other components, both electronic and non-electronic, within the device impacts the functionality of the antenna. In some cases, interference from other components within the device significantly reduces the range, signal strength, and overall connectivity capabilities of the antenna, thus preventing the antenna from effectively connecting or communicating with other electronic devices. In many cases, a similar result occurs depending on the distance and orientation of the antenna relative to an external device with which the antenna is communicating. As such, there remains a need in the art for integrating radio antennas into a compact, aesthetically-pleasing form factor for a wearable heads-up display in order to maximize connectivity, range, and signal strength of the antenna, regardless of the position of an external device relative to the antenna over a given range.
- In at least some embodiments, a wearable heads-up display may be provided in the form of eyeglasses frames and eyeglasses frames assemblies carrying an antenna for inter-device connectivity. Such glasses may include a minimal form factor that is aesthetically pleasing and an antenna design that enables superior range, signal strength, and overall connectivity capabilities of the antenna.

First arm 1218 includes afirst frame portion 1220 and afirst temple portion 1222.Temple portion 1222 is hollow and has afirst aperture 1236 at the front to allow for components of a wearable heads-up display to be inserted throughfirst aperture 1236 and placed within eyewear, forexample eyeglasses 1100, as described herein.First frame portion 1220 is preferably stiff and inflexible such that whenfirst frame portion 1220 is coupled to thefront eyeglass frame 1102,first arm 1218 maintains a fixed position relative to thefront eyeglass frame 1102.First frame portion 1220 andfirst temple portion 1222 may be formed as a single, unitary, integral component or may be two components which are combined to makefirst arm 1218. In the implementation illustrated inFIG. 12 ,first frame portion 1220 is attached tofirst temple portion 1222 with screws but other fasteners may be used (e.g., bolts, rivets, adhesive, epoxy, etc.). -
First arm 1218 further includes afirst hinge 1224, which separates thefirst temple portion 1222 into a firstanterior part 1222 a and afirst posterior part 1222 b. However, in some implementations, thefirst arm 1218 does not include thefirst hinge 1224, in which case the anterior andposter parts temple portion 1222. - In
FIG. 12 , aradio 1240 is housed within thefirst arm 1218, and preferably within thefirst temple portion 1222 and even more preferably within the firstanterior part 1222 a of thefirst temple portion 1222. In some implementations, theradio 1240 may be coupled to a printed circuit board (not shown) housed in thefirst temple portion 1222, in which case, theradio 1240 is in electrical communication with electrically conductive traces of the printed circuit board (not shown). In an implementation, theradio 1240 can take the form of a transmitter and, or, receiver, or a transmitter. An antenna, represented by dashedlines 1242, is electrically coupled to and in electrical communication with theradio 1240. Theradio 1240 and antenna(s) are operable to provide wireless communications in the radio frequency and, or microwave frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. - In an implementation, the
antenna 1242 extends from theradio 1240 in the firstanterior portion 1222 a, through the firstanterior portion 1222 a to at least thefirst posterior portion 1222 b. In other implementations, theantenna 1242 extends through thefirst hinge 1224 toward adistal end 1244 of thefirst arm 1218, while in other implementations, thefirst hinge 1224 is not present and thus theantenna 1242 extends through thefirst arm 1218 toward thedistal end 1244 of thefirst arm 1218 without passing through thehinge 1224. In still further implementations, theantenna 1242 extends from theradio 1240 to terminate proximate thedistal end 1244 of thefirst arm 1218. While theantenna 1242 is illustrated inFIG. 12 as a dashed line, theantenna 1242 can be a variety of geometric shapes with varying cross sections. - For example, in various implementations, the
antenna 1242 has a circular, ovular, triangular, rectangular, or square cross section along its length. In addition, in certain other implementations, theantenna 1242 changes size along its length, for example, a dimension between outer surfaces of theantenna 1242 proximate theradio 1240 may be greater than, equal to, or less than, a dimension between outer surfaces of theantenna 1242 proximate thedistal end 1244. Still further, theantenna 1242 can change size and or shape along its length, such that in an implementation, theantenna 1242 is continuously tapered along at least a portion of its length or all of its length, while in other implementations, a greatest dimension between exterior surfaces of theantenna 1242 along its length changes multiple times, such as in a “step-down” configuration. Still further, theantenna 1242 can include different cross sections along its length along with one or more transitions, for example, a portion of theantenna 1242 proximate theradio 1240 may have a square cross section, a portion of theantenna 1242 proximate its mid-point may have a triangular cross section, and a portion of theantenna 1242 proximate thedistal end 1244 may have a circular cross section. Accordingly, implementations of the present disclosure encompass a wide variety of shapes and configurations of theantenna 1242. - In other alternative implementations of the antenna, represented by dashed
lines 1238, theantenna 1238 extends from theradio 1240 to terminate in, or proximate to, thefirst aperture 1236. In an implementation where theantenna 1238 terminates in thefirst aperture 1236, theantenna 1238 occupies a portion of, or substantially all of, thefirst aperture 1236 and may have a substantially rectangular shape, although other geometric shapes are possible. For example,antenna 1238 may be a circle, a square, an oval, a triangle, a trapezoid, a pentagon, a hexagon, or an octagon, among others. Further, theantenna 1238 may be connected toradio 1240 with a portion of theantenna 1238 having any of the above shapes, features or configurations disclosed above with reference to the implementation of the antenna represented by dashedlines 1242. - In addition, implementations of the present disclosure include an antenna, a power source, and an electrically conductive path or wire placed in various locations within a front frame of eyewear. For example,
FIG. 13A is a perspective view of an exemplary implementation ofeyeglasses 1300, which may be, in an implementation, substantially similar in structure toeyeglasses 1100, having anantenna 1301 incorporated in theeyeglasses 1300.FIG. 13B is a perspective view of theantenna 1301 showing features of theantenna 1301 in more detail. For ease of recognition in the drawings,eyeglasses 1300 are represented by dashed lines and certain internal features, such as the frame portions and apertures ofarms eyeglasses 1300. - The
eyeglasses 1300 include first andsecond arms front eyeglass frame 1302. Thefront eyeglass frame 1302 includes afirst rim 1304 and asecond rim 1310 securely physically coupled by abridge 1316. Aradio 1340 is housed internally in afirst temple portion 1322 of thefirst arm 1318, and preferably within a firstanterior portion 1322 a of thefirst temple portion 1322 of thefirst arm 1318. Theradio 1340 is electrically coupled to, or in electrical communication with theantenna 1301, which passes internally through theeyeglasses 1300 and front eyeglass frames 1302 of theeyeglasses 1300 as discussed below. - The
antenna 1301 extends from theradio 1340 at least proximate thefirst temple portion 1322 and the first frame portion (not shown) of thefirst arm 1318, through the first aperture (not shown) and along at least a portion of thefirst rim 1304. In an implementation, theantenna 1301 terminates at any location within thefirst rim 1304, while in the implementation illustrated inFIG. 13A , theantenna 1301 extends from theradio 1340 in thefirst arm 1318 along a first upperperipheral portion 1306 of thefirst rim 1304 to terminate proximate thebridge 1316. In a further implementation, theantenna 1301 terminates in thebridge 1316, or in other words, a seconddistal end 1309 is a terminal end ofantenna 1301 and is positioned internally within thebridge 1316 when the eyeglasses are in an operational or assembled state. In this configuration, afirst portion 1303 of theantenna 1301 is housed at least partially in thefirst temple portion 1322 of thefirst arm 1318 and a second andthird portion antenna 1301 are housed at least partially in thefirst frame 1304, and more preferably within the first upperperipheral portion 1306 of thefirst frame 1304. - Although not specifically shown, the
antenna 1301 can extend beyond thebridge 1316 to terminate within thesecond rim 1310. For example, in an implementation, theantenna 1301 extends from theradio 1340, through the first upperperipheral portion 1306 of thefirst rim 1304, through thebridge 1316 to terminate within either a second upperperipheral portion 1312 or a second lowerperipheral portion 1314 of thesecond rim 1310. Theantenna 1301 can pass internally from theradio 1340, through the first aperture (not shown) of thefirst arm 1318 to at least a first lowerperipheral portion 1308 of the first rim. In such an implementation, theantenna 1301 terminates within the first lowerperipheral portion 1308, within thebridge 1316 as above, or beyond thebridge 1316 to a location within thesecond rim 1310. In implementations where theantenna 1301 passes through the first lowerperipheral portion 1308 of thefirst rim 1304 and extends beyond thebridge 1316, theantenna 1301 can terminate within the second upperperipheral portion 1312 or the second lowerperipheral portion 1314 of thesecond rim 1310. It is even possible, in an implementation, to extend the antenna from thefirst arm 1318, through thefirst rim 1304, thebridge 1316, and thesecond rim 1310 to terminate within thesecond arm 1326. -
FIG. 13A further illustrates apower source 1346 a. In a preferred implementation, thepower source 1346 a is housed internally within asecond temple portion 1328 of thesecond arm 1326, and more preferably within a secondanterior portion 1328 a of thesecond temple portion 1328 of thesecond arm 1326. Thepower source 1346 a may be a portable power source, such as a battery or a supercapacitor (i.e., capacitor with capacitance on the order of 0.01 F or greater). In addition, where thepower source 1346 a is a battery, the battery can be rechargeable (i.e., a user inserts an external charging cord intoglasses 1300 to charge the battery comprising thepower source 1346 a), or replaceable (i.e., theglasses 1300 include a removable cover for removing and replacing the battery or batteries comprising thepower source 1346 a). In implementations where thepower source 1346 a is one or more replaceable batteries, circuitry may be housed within either of thearms second temple portions radio 1340. In other words, the circuity is communicatively coupleable to the replaceable battery or batteries comprising thepower source 1346 a. However, in implementations where thepower source 1346 a is a rechargeable battery or a supercapacitor, the same or substantially similar circuity may be present to connect thepower source 1346 a to theradio 1340. Thepower source 1346 a is electrically coupled to theradio 1340 bywire 1348 a to transmit electric current from thepower source 1346 a to power theradio 1340, as well as any other electronic components housed within thefirst temple portion 1322 of thefirst arm 1318. - In an implementation, the
wire 1348 a passes internally from thepower source 1346 a housed within thesecond temple portion 1328, through a second aperture (not shown) in thesecond arm 1326, thesecond rim 1310, thebridge 1316, thefirst rim 1304, the first aperture (not shown) to theradio 1340 in thefirst temple portion 1322. As with theantenna 1301, thewire 1348 a can pass through any of the elements of thefront eyeglass frame 1302, irrespective of the location of theantenna 1301. For example, in various implementations thewire 1348 a passes internally through the second upperperipheral portion 1312 of thesecond rim 1310, thebridge 1316, and the first upperperipheral portion 1306 of thefirst rim 1304. In other implementations, thewire 1348 a passes through the second lowerperipheral portion 1314, thebridge 1316, and the first upperperipheral portion 1306 of thefirst rim 1304. In alternative implementations, thewire 1348 a passes through the second upperperipheral portion 1312, thebridge 1316, and the first lowerperipheral portion 1308. Accordingly, implementations of the present disclosure are not limited by the path of thewire 1348 a through thefront eyeglass frame 1302. - In other variations, the power source and wire are located within the
first temple portion 1318 along with theradio 1340, as represented by dashedlines wire 1348 b preferably does not pass through any portion of thefront eyeglass frame 1302. Rather, thepower source 1346 b is housed proximate theradio 1340 and electrically coupled toradio 1340 bywire 1348 b. It may even be possible to include thepower source 1346 b within a firstanterior portion 1322 b of thefirst temple portion 1322 or a secondanterior portion 1328 b of thesecond temple portion 1328. In other words, in an implementation, thepower source 1346 b is located within the firstanterior portion 1322 b proximate adistal end 1344 of thefirst arm 1318 or within the secondanterior portion 1328 b of thesecond temple portion 1328. -
FIG. 13B is a perspective view of theantenna 1301. In other words,FIG. 13B illustrates an implementation of theantenna 1301 that is capable of extending through various parts of thefront eyeglass frame 1302 as described with reference toFIG. 13A . With continuing reference toFIGS. 13A-B , theantenna 1301 includes thefirst portion 1303, thesecond portion 1305, and thethird portion 1307 extending between first and second distal ends 1317 and 1309. Theantenna 1301 is preferably a single, unitary, integral piece comprised ofportions first portion 1300 is substantially perpendicular tosecond portion 1305 andthird portion 1307 is substantially perpendicular tosecond portion 1305. Theantenna 1301 andportions first arm 1318, through the first aperture (not shown) and into thefront eyeglass frame 1302. Theantenna 1301 further includes opposingsurfaces surfaces connector 1315 is coupled to theantenna 1301, or formed as a single, unitary, integral component of theantenna 1301, proximate the firstdistal end 1317 for enabling connection with theradio 1340. - In addition, implementations of the present disclosure include the
antenna 1301 having a variety of geometric shapes and orientations. For example, in various implementations, theantenna 1301 has a circular, ovular, triangular, rectangular, or square cross section along its length, or along at least a portion of its length. In addition, in certain other implementations, theantenna 1301 changes size along its length, for example, a dimension betweenouter surfaces antenna 1301 proximate the firstdistal end 1317 may be greater than, equal to, or less than, a dimension betweenouter surfaces antenna 1301 proximate thedistal end 1317. Additionally or alternatively, theantenna 1301 can change shape along its length, such that in an implementation, theantenna 1301 is continuously tapered along at least a portion of its length or all of its length, while in other implementations, a greatest dimension betweenexterior surfaces antenna 1301 along its length changes multiple times, such as in a “step-down” configuration (i.e., a first dimension betweenouter surfaces antenna 1301 can include different cross sections along its length along with one or more transitions, for example, thefirst portion 1303 of theantenna 1301 proximate the firstdistal end 1317 may have a square cross section, thesecond portion 1305 may have a triangular cross section, and thethird portion 1307 may have a circular cross section. - In other implementations, the
antenna 1301 may include one or more curved or bent portions along its length, as well as portions which are substantially flat and planar. For example, a height of theantenna 1301 relative to the firstdistal end 1317 may increase from the firstdistal end 1317 to thefirst portion 1303 and remain relatively constant through thefirst portion 1303, increase in thesecond portion 1305 and remain constant in thesecond portion 1305, and remain constant in thethird portion 1307 relative to an upper portion of thesecond portion 1305. In other implementations, the opposite may be true (i.e., the firstdistal end 1317 is the highest point relative to other portions of the antenna 1301). In still further implementations, each of theportions distal ends FIG. 13B , the seconddistal end 1309 is angled and of a lower height relative to a highest point of thethird portion 1307. Accordingly, implementations of the present disclosure encompass a wide variety of shapes and configurations of theantenna 1301. As such, implementations of the present disclosure include theantenna 1301 having any potential geometric shape and configuration to correspond to implementations of theeyeglasses 1300. - In an implementation, the
antenna 1301 is electrically coupled to theradio 1340 and operative to wirelessly transmit radio frequency signals that embody an established wireless communication protocol, for example, without limitation: Bluetooth®, Bluetooth® Low-Energy, Bluetooth Smart®, ZigBee®, WiFi®, Near-Field Communication (NFC), or the like. Such protocols typically employ radio frequency signals in the range of 1 GHz to 10 GHz (with the exception of NFC, which operates in the 10 MHz-20 MHz range) and may include pairing or otherwise establishing a wireless communicative link between an apparatus, such as a wearable heads-up display carrying theantenna 1301, and another external electronic device. -
FIG. 14A is a perspective view of an alternative exemplary implementation ofeyeglasses 1400, which may be, in an implementation, substantially similar in structure toeyeglasses 1100, having anantenna 1401 incorporated in theeyeglasses 1400.FIG. 14B is a perspective view of theantenna 1401 showing features of theantenna 1401 in more detail. For ease of recognition in the drawings,eyeglasses 1400 are represented by dashed lines and certain internal features, such as the frame portions and apertures ofarms eyeglasses 1400. - The
eyeglasses 1400 include first andsecond arms front eyeglass frame 1402. Thefront eyeglass frame 1402 includes afirst rim 1404 having a first upperperipheral portion 1406 and a first lowerperipheral portion 1408 and asecond rim 1410 having a second upperperipheral portion 1412 and a second lowerperipheral portion 1414. Thefirst rim 1404 is securely physically coupled to thesecond rim 1410 by abridge 1416. Thefirst arm 1418 includes afirst temple portion 1422, which may be separated into a firstanterior portion 1422 a and afirst posterior portion 1422 b by ahinge 1424, as described herein. Similarly, thesecond arm 1426 includes asecond temple portion 1428, which may include a secondanterior portion 1428 a. - In the illustrated implementation, a
radio 1440 is housed within thefirst temple portion 1422 of thefirst arm 1418, and more preferably, within the firstanterior portion 1422 a, although it may also be possible to house theradio 1440 in afirst posterior portion 1422 b of thefirst temple portion 1422. In the illustrated implementation, theantenna 1401 is communicatively coupled to theradio 1440 and extends internally along at least a portion of thefirst rim 1404. In other implementations, theantenna 1401 extends internally from theradio 1440, through part of thefirst temple portion 1422, through the first aperture (not shown), and along the first lowerperipheral portion 1408 to terminate proximate thebridge 1416. In other words, in this implementation, a seconddistal end 1411 of theantenna 1401 is located within thefirst rim 1404, and more specifically proximate the first lowerperipheral portion 1408 and thebridge 1416. - It is also possible for the
antenna 1401 to extend along the first lowerperipheral portion 1408 and beyond thebridge 1416 to terminate in either the second upperperipheral portion 1412 or the second lowerperipheral portion 1414. Similarly, it is possible for theantenna 1401 to extend along at least a portion of the first upperperipheral portion 1406 to terminate proximate thebridge 1416, within thebridge 1416, or terminate beyond thebridge 1416 in either the second upperperipheral portion 1412 or the second lowerperipheral portion 1414, although not specifically shown. Further, in an implementation, theantenna 1401 extends around only thefirst rim 1404, such that theantenna 1401 extends along the first lowerperipheral portion 1408 to terminate with the first upperperipheral portion 1406. Accordingly, theantenna 1401 may extend along any portion of thefront eyeglass frame 1402 and terminate with the same, or a different portion of any part of thefront eyeglass frame 1402. - In the illustrated implementation, the
antenna 1401 includes afirst portion 1403,second portion 1405, andthird portion 1407. Thefirst portion 1403 is located at least partially within thefirst temple portion 1422, thesecond portion 1405 is located at least partially in thefirst rim 1404, and thethird portion 1407 is located at least partially within the first lowerperipheral portion 1408 of thefirst rim 1404. -
FIG. 14A also illustrates apower source 1446 a, which may be a portable power source, such as a battery or a supercapacitor, as above. The power source 4 r 46 a is electrically coupled to theradio 1440 by a first electricallyconductive path 1447 a extending along a portion of thesecond rim 1410, thebridge 1416, and a portion of thefirst rim 1404. In other implementations, the first electricallyconductive path 1447 a passes internally along the second lowerperipheral portion 1414, thebridge 1416 and the first upperperipheral portion 1406 of thefirst rim 1404, while in further alternative implementations, the first electricallyconductive path 1447 a passes internally along the second lowerperipheral portion 1414 of thesecond rim 1410, thebridge 1416, and the first lowerperipheral portion 1408 of thefirst rim 1404. The first electricallyconductive path 1447 a may also pass internally along the second upperperipheral portion 1412, thebridge 1416, and the first upperperipheral portion 1406 of thefirst rim 1404. - In addition, it is possible to have the power source, represented by dashed
lines 1446 b, located in thefirst temple portion 1422, which is to say that thepower source 1446 b can be located in thesame arm 1418 as other electronic components, such as theradio 1440, or display producing components, and a second electricallyconductive path 1447 b electrically couples theradio 1440 to thepower source 1446 b. In this case, the second electricallyconductive path 1447 b extends along at least a portion of thefirst arm 1418, or more preferably, along at least a portion of thefirst temple portion 1422 and does not necessarily extend along any portion of thefront eyeglass frame 1402. Further, the first and second electricallyconductive paths conductive paths antenna 1401 within theeyeglasses 1400. Rather, any of the locations of the antennas 1142,1301 and 1401 may be used along with any combination of the electricallyconductive paths eyeglasses 1400. - At least one of the
arms temple portions arms front eyeglass frame 1402 may be formed of various materials, for example various plastics (i.e., zylonite or cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate propionate, nylon, blended nylon, castor oil-based plastics) or metals (i.e., stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, monel, flexon, beryllium, and alloys of any of the above in combination with other metals), among others. Further, although theantenna 1401 andradio 1440 are illustrated herein as being housed in thefirst temple portion 1422, theantenna 1401 andradio 1440 can be housed in thesecond temple portion 1428, or in other locations with theeyeglasses 1400. -
FIG. 14B is a perspective view of theantenna 1401. In other words,FIG. 14B illustrates an implementation of theantenna 1401 that is capable of extending through various parts of thefront eyeglass frame 1402 as described with reference toFIG. 14A . With continuing reference toFIGS. 14A-B , the antenna includes thefirst portion 1403, thesecond portion 1405, and thethird portion 1407. Preferably, theantenna 1401 is formed as a single, unitary, integral component comprised ofportions distal end 1409 and a seconddistal end 1411. In an implementation, thesecond portion 1405 is substantially perpendicular to thethird portion 1407. Theantenna 1401 andportions first arm 1418, through the first aperture (not shown) and into thefront eyeglass frame 1402. Theantenna 1401 further includes aconnector 1412 proximate the first distal end 4009 for enabling connection with theradio 1440. - In addition, implementations of the present disclosure include the
antenna 1401 having a variety of geometric shapes and orientations. For example, in various implementations, theantenna 1401 has a circular, ovular, triangular, rectangular, or square cross section along its length, or along at least a portion of its length. In addition, in certain other implementations, theantenna 1401 changes size along its length, for example, a dimension between outermost surfaces of theantenna 1401 proximate the firstdistal end 1409 may be greater than, equal to, or less than, a dimension between outermost surfaces of theantenna 1401 proximate the seconddistal end 1411. Still further, theantenna 1401 can change shape along its length, such that in an implementation, theantenna 1401 is continuously tapered along at least a portion of its length or all of its length, while in other implementations, a greatest dimension between outermost surfaces of theantenna 1401 along its length changes multiple times, such as in a “step-down” or a “step-up” configuration (i.e., a first dimension between outermost surfaces is greater than or less than a second dimension, which is greater than or less than a third dimension, and so on). Still further, theantenna 1401 can include different cross sections along its length along with one or more transitions, for example, thefirst portion 1403 of theantenna 1401 proximate the firstdistal end 1409 may have a square cross section, thesecond portion 1405 may have a triangular cross section, and thethird portion 1407 may have a circular cross section. - In other implementations, the
antenna 1401 may include one or more curved or bent portions along its length, as well as portions which are substantially flat and planar. For example, a height of theantenna 1401 relative to the firstdistal end 1409 may increase from the firstdistal end 1409 to thefirst portion 1403 and remain relatively constant through thefirst portion 1403, increase in thesecond portion 1405 and remain constant in thesecond portion 1405, and remain constant in thethird portion 1407. In the illustrated implementation, the opposite may be true. For example, the firstdistal end 1409 is the highest point relative to other portions of theantenna 1401. In still further implementations, each of theportions distal ends antenna 1401. As such, implementations of the present disclosure include theantenna 1401 having any potential geometric shape and configuration to correspond to implementations of theeyeglasses 1400. - In an implementation, the
antenna 1401 is electrically coupled to theradio 1440 and operative to wirelessly transmit radio frequency signals that embody an established wireless communication protocol, for example, without limitation: Bluetooth®, Bluetooth® Low-Energy, Bluetooth Smart®, ZigBee®, WiFi®, Near-Field Communication (NFC), or the like. Such protocols typically employ radio frequency signals in the range of 1 GHz to 10 GHz (with the exception of NFC, which operates in the 10 MHz-20 MHz range) and may include pairing or otherwise establishing a wireless communicative link between an apparatus, such as a wearable heads-up display carrying theantenna 1401, and another external electronic device. - The various implementations described herein provide a compact, aesthetically pleasing glasses form factor that includes an antenna and a radio for enabling inter-device connectivity. Further, because a location, orientation and position of the antenna is adjustable relative to other electrical components, such as a power source and an electrically conductive path, interference between the antenna and other components within the eyeglass is minimized. As a result, implementations of the present disclosure allow for optimization of the connectivity, range, and signal strength of the antenna when transmitting or receiving signals from other electronic devices. In particular, implementations of the present disclosure enable optimal connectivity, range, and signal strength characteristics for the antenna and the radio regardless of the position of an external device within a given range.
- Referring now to
FIG. 15 , there is illustrated a schematic block diagram of an example architecture of a system providing microservices to a wearable computing device.System 1500 generally has awearable computing device 1510—which may be an implementation ofwearable computing device 110 ofsystem 100 depicted inFIG. 1 ,wearable computing device 210 ofFIG. 2 , and/orwearable computing device 710 ofFIG. 7 ; ahost computing device 1540—which may be an implementation ofhost computing device 140 ofsystem 100 depicted inFIG. 1 and/orhost computing device 440 ofFIG. 4 ; and at least oneremote computing device 1580—which may be an implementation ofremote computing device 180 ofsystem 100 depicted inFIG. 1 and/orremote computing device 580 ofFIG. 5 . Optionally, thesystem 1500 can further include a controller device (not shown inFIG. 15 )—which may be an implementation ofcontroller device 120 ofsystem 100 depicted inFIG. 1 ,controller device 320 ofFIG. 3 , and/orcontroller device 720 ofFIG. 7 . - As described elsewhere herein, the
