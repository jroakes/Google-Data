- the invention generally relates to a system and method for an information vault and, more particularly, to a system and method for an information vault and controlling access to the information vault.
- Unrecoverable loss of data is familiar to nearly everyone. Important documents, images, and financial information are frequently lost not only for individuals but small organizations as well as large. Unrecoverable loss may undermine a business' future to continue or operate.
- business processes e.g., charging, shipping
- information is valuable.
- the illicit use of information could cause a financial loss to the owner or confer an unfair advantage to another party.
- organizations collect personal information and preferences and sell them on the open market as phone lists, market research, or the like.
- the individual who owns this information i.e., the person themselves
- the information compilers or middlemen essentially take an individual's information and sell the information. Not only does the individual not get compensated for the middlemen's and advertisers' use of the information but are also indiscriminately solicited or spammed as a result.
- the current common solution involves each “second party”, i.e., the entities an individual may give personal information to, “to promise” via privacy policies that are long and difficult to read, to not compromise or sell information. It is common knowledge that these policies are then either ignored or having been slyly worded, the private personal information is shared with others. Or, the private information is merely stolen by outsiders or insiders at any of the thousands of entities that store personal information.
- American Express has implemented a “Private Payment” service where a user obtains a special card number (requested in real-time by a user at the Amex web site) to use for a web purchase so that no one ever sees an individual's real card number. This number looks like an Amex card number and has an expiration date of a month or so.
- each of these implementations has not addressed allowing an owner of the information to control access to the personal data and to enable value to flow to the owner of the personal information.
- a secure information repository system comprising data storage for securely storing encrypted information associated with an account holder and a deposit system for securely depositing encrypted information into the data storage.
- the system also comprises an information access system for accessing the encrypted information stored in the data storage, an information withdrawal system for removing the encrypted information stored in the data storage and a tracking system for logging a deposit to the data storage, a withdrawal from the data storage, a deletion to the data storage, an account creation, an account deletion or an access to the data storage.
- a system for a protected information repository comprises an information vault having data storage.
- the information vault comprises a means for securely creating an account in the information vault, a means for securely depositing information in the information vault, a means for accessing information in the information vault and a means for charging for transactional activity involving the information.
- a method of providing an information repository comprises accessing an information vault to perform a transaction involving a secured item of information stored in the information vault, authenticating an identity of an entity performing the accessing, executing the transaction when the identity of the entity is authenticated and logging the transaction.
- a method of charging for personal information comprises depositing personal data by an owner into an information vault, establishing a contract with at least one entity and the owner to enable access to the personal data by the at least one entity, accessing the personal data by the at least one entity according to terms of the contract and charging a fee for accessing the personal data.
- a computer program product comprising a computer usable medium having readable program code embodied in the medium.
- the computer program product includes at least one component to access an information vault to perform a transaction involving a secured item of information stored in the information vault, authenticate an identity of an entity performing the accessing, execute the transaction when the identity of the entity is authenticated and log the transaction.

- This invention is, generally, in one embodiment, directed to a system and method for providing an information vault so that individual owners of personal data may control and manage the access and dissemination of the personal data.
- the system and method also provides for the owner of the personal data to receive compensation for the use of the personal data, thus, in effect, the personal data becomes a valuable commodity analogous to money.
- the invention provides a business model that allows competitive, unbiased trusted third parties whose business is protecting the information analogous to how a commercial bank protects money.
- the system and method of the invention provides a trusted storage of personal data, thereby minimizing the number of copies that may be in existence.
- Second party access to the trusted storage of personal data may be made on-demand, as required for commerce, with a process for assessing fees for accesses.
- FIG. 1 is an exemplary overview of an embodiment of the invention.
- An “Information Vault”, generally denoted by reference numeral 100 provides for an information infrastructure patterned somewhat after the currency model of the world's financial infrastructure, for example.
- the vault 100 employs current data storage 105 and security technologies to provide a secure storage mechanism for user's information, such as for example, name, address, phone numbers, medical records, credit card information, demographic information, or similar personal data. Certain information may be encrypted by the owner to make the data totally private, even from the vault, as denoted by reference numeral 115 .
- a computer system 120 e.g., a personal computer
- a set of services 110 are provided, built on the vault's secure storage, to allow users to create accounts, deposit information in any form, and read or remove the information.
- Information may be stored in the vault encrypted by the vault and optionally, users may encrypt the information with their own private key.
- vault services 110 are provided to allow a user to specify conditions, in a secure way via technologies of the existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), so that a second party 125 may have read access to certain, sharable portions of the user's information. All accesses typically use the first and second party's public keys as identification. To share information with a second party, a contract data token specifying the two parties' public keys may be created and digitally signed by the first party's private key to ensure that access to private information is not propagated beyond the second party.
- This feature of the invention allows a migration away from the current approach of users providing second party entities (e.g. online web merchants) their personal information and thereafter compelled to trust the merchants to securely protect the information from compromise.
- second party entities e.g. online web merchants
- the user provides the second party 125 permission to read an agreed upon set of personal information.
- the information is thereafter always available to the second party (at least until cancellation or recasting of the contract), there is no longer any need for the second party to store the user's personal information within its own databases.
- the information vault 100 significantly contributes to the elimination of the escalating dangers of identity theft.
- the system may also allow second parties to request certain processing or services which may significantly eliminate the need for the second party 125 to ever see the personal information of the first party. Provision is also made in the system for a user to specify personal information (e.g., my consumer preferences and demographics) that the vault may make publicly available for commercial purposes such as marketing data consumers 140 , with proceeds going to the user/owner, or otherwise, made publicly available for free for charitable or scientific purposes 145 .
- personal information e.g., my consumer preferences and demographics
- FIG. 1 shows that the invention is based on, and does not replace, the financial network for payments (e.g., banking 150 ) for information vault services or Certificate Authorities 155 of the PKI for certificate and key verifications.
- the interface to the bank 150 may include interfaces to financial networks for debits and payments for vault transactions and services.
- the invention may also provide audit logs 160 of transactions.
- the invention therefore, establishes the concept of information as “money” or “currency” itself.
- the invention is capable of providing underlying technology and business processes for providing an information vault, exchange and processing system that include in embodiments:
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a physical information vault architecture.
- the Information Vault 100 comprises a typical three tier networking architecture.
- a user via user computer 120 , and second party or parties 125 may access the Information Vault 100 with a secure connection over the Internet 200 or similar connection
- the first tier layer 205 facing the open network is the DMZ (i.e., popularly referred to as the “demilitarized zone”) or presentation tier.
- This layer sits behind a firewall/network dispatcher 210 and includes multiple HTTP Servers 215 , possibly geographically separated for high availability reasons.
- This first tier layer 205 accepts requests from outside users and provides presentation level services for the requests. Service requests are passed on to the application services layer of the vault services.
- the vault services layer 225 handles the business logic for the system, as described below.
- One or more databases 230 within the layer keep metadata and a mapping between uses and their associated information.
- a request is made through a third firewall/network dispatcher 240 to the Vault Layer 245 .
- the Vault Layer 245 may be a highly redundant set of storage areas 250 a and 250 b , typically geographically separated.
- data may be sliced across the separated servers 255 a and 255 b so that no single compromise of security may provide access to user information.
- Other data security technologies may be applied to the information vault 100 in order to ensure integrity, as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art.
- FIG. 3 is a swim lane diagram showing steps of an embodiment of a digital certificate creation.
- “Swim lane” diagrams may be used to show the relationship between the various “actors” in the processes and to define the steps involved in the processes.
- FIG. 3 (and all the other swim lane Figures) may equally represent a high-level block diagram of components of the invention implementing the steps thereof.
- the steps of FIG. 3 (and all the other Figures employing swim lane diagrams) may be implemented on computer program code in combination with the appropriate hardware.
- This computer program code may be stored on storage media such as a diskette, hard disk, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM or tape, as well as a memory storage device or collection of memory storage devices such as read-only memory (ROM) or random access memory (RAM). Additionally, the computer program code can be transferred to a workstation over the Internet or some other type of network.
- the steps of FIG. 3 (and the other swim lane Figures) may also be implemented by the embodiments of FIGS. 1 and 2
- a lane for Trusted Third Party Identity Authenticator 305 e.g., certificate authority 155
- a lane for the party applying (applicant) for a digital certificate 310 e.g., a lane for the party applying (applicant) for a digital certificate 310
- a lane for a witness 315 e.g., the applicant completes an application for a digital certificate providing any number of identity authenticating information predetermined by the vault provider, such as biometrics, personal information (e.g., name, address, age, financial data, date of birth, or the like) and artifacts.
- a witness(s) verifies the authentication artifacts and adds a signature and witness identification to the application.
- the applicant applies to a certificate authority (e.g., certificate authority 155 ) for a certificate.
- the certificate authority processes the application and checks for completeness.
- the certificate authority interviews the witness(es) and at step 345 the witness(es) verify the application.
- the certificate authority interviews the applicant and at step 310 , the applicant verifies the application.
- the certificate authority issues a certificate and related certificate tokens and/or biometric reader devices, and management software.
- the applicant safeguards the certificate and installs the certificate, management software, and biometric reader, as appropriate.
- FIG. 4 is a swim lane diagram of an embodiment showing steps of mutual party authentication, beginning at step 415 .
- Four lanes are shown including a lane for the trusted third party identity authenticator 305 , a lane for a user (typically at a browser) 400 , a lane for vault services 405 , and a lane for the vault 410 .
- the user authenticates themselves on a personal device such as a biometric device and requests a certificate from the vault services via a browser or other technique.
- the vault service provides a certificate to the user.
- the certificate has identifying information of the information vault plus a signed hash from a trusted certificate authority (CA).
- a signature may be created by calculating a hash over the data using an algorithm that is one-way (i.e., the identifying information cannot be generated from the hash value).
- the signing entity encrypts the hash value with its private key.
- the encrypted data may be unencrypted using the public key.
- the user's PC receives the certificate and, at step 435 , using a third party identity authenticator determines the authenticity of the certificate by calculating a hash over the information vault's certificate, decrypts the signed hash value from the CA and compares the resulting two values to verify the certificate. Equal values indicate that the information vault is actually the information vault. Thus, the information vault is authenticated from the user's perspective.
- the vault services receives the user's personal certificate and, at step 445 , the authenticity of the user's personal certificate is determined in a like manner as the vault certificate and is authenticated by verifying the personal certificate.
- the personal certificate is authenticated by the third party authenticator and returned to the vault services.
- the user's machine encrypts all traffic to the information vault using the information vault's public key, and the information vault encrypts data to the user with the user's public key.
- a secure transport such as secured socket layer (SSL) communication may be employed by the vault services.
- SSL secured socket layer
- FIG. 5 is a swim lane diagram of an embodiment showing steps of creating an account.
- the user chooses to apply for an information vault account and access the information vault services supplying a personal digital certificate.
- the vault services determine the authenticity of the applicant/user, and, at step 510 , using the third party authenticator, verifies the applicant's certificate.
- the vault services prompt the user for personal and payment information.
- the user/applicant provides information for opening an account such as name, address, date of birth, social security number, payment information, joint account information, or the like.
- the vault services gather any demographic data and certificate public key to establish the applicant's account.
- the applicant's financial data is verified.
- the account is established and the user/applicant may log off.
- FIG. 6 is a swim lane diagram of an embodiment showing steps of depositing information into a user account, beginning at step 600 where the user and vault services mutually authenticate one another (e.g., the process of FIG. 4 ).
- the user may choose to deposit an item of information at the information vault.
- a prompt is issued by the vault services for identifying the information (user created or pre-generated) such as permissions, expiration time, the security level (e.g., open, secure, anonymous/lock box).
- the user's device encrypts the information with public key of the information vault which ensures that only the vault may read the information.
- the information may be transmitted to the information vault.
- the user enters data or chooses to upload binary data.
- the user may add a string of data or a binary file (binary can be any information, including, for example, a text file or video).
- the string data may include descriptive information about the information item and may describe the format of the information item itself. For private information, this field may optionally be used by the depositor to specify data format. For sharable information, the field may be set by the depositor and may be used to specify a pre-negotiated format identifier or set to a standard XML format. For commercial information, the depositor may select the type of commercial information to deposit, the associated Commercial Data Formatter (CDF) applet may be instantiated and the CDF sets the data type field accordingly.
- This string field is part of the descriptive information about the information item. It defines the access possibilities of the information item. At a minimum it can be set to: “Private”, “Sharable”, and “Commercial”.
- the settings may have the following definitions in embodiments:
- the vault services may use a one way hash algorithm to determine a hash location for the information. That is, the information may be stored on servers using a hash mechanism to create a unique identifier (handle) of the information (public key+information identifier), which may be used as the storage point for the information and remembered in the vault map 230 .
- the information may be stored encrypted when creating a user account and may be encrypted with the information vault's public key. For open or secure security levels, the information may have metadata identifying the owner, permissions, etc. This allows the information vault to retrieve the information more easily at a later time.
- the information may be saved to a storage system in encrypted bundles.
- a vault map may store the mapping between the handles and the data's corresponding location in the vault.
- a charge may be applied to the user for the storage and use of the vault services.
- An audit log may be kept of the transaction.
- the user may log off.
- FIG. 7 is a swim lane diagram of an embodiment showing steps of reading information from an account, beginning at step 700 where the user and vault services mutually authenticate one another (e.g., process of FIG. 4 ).
- a user chooses to get/read information from the vault and accesses the vault services using a browser, for example.
- a prompt is issued by the vault services for an information identifier.
- the user may enter an identifier, choose a preset identifier, or choose to “discover” any open or secure items in the information vault associated with the identifier.
- One way that the discovery process may work is for the system to determine all combinations of the user's public key and identifiers.
- the vault service may use a one way hash algorithm to determine the location of the information employing the user's public key.
- the information is retrieved by the information vault services from the vault.
- the information is decrypted with the vault's private key and encrypted with the user's public key.
- a charge may be assessed for the transaction, if appropriate.
- An audit log entry may also be created.
- the user retrieves the information.
- the user decrypts the information with a private key and at step 750 , the user may log off.
- FIG. 8 is a swim lane diagram of an embodiment showing steps of removing information from a user account, beginning at step 800 where the user and vault services mutually authenticate one another (e.g., process of FIG. 4 ).
- the user may choose to “remove” information from the vault by accessing vault services.
- the vault services prompt for identification information from the user.
- the user specifies which information to remove which may be an identifier, or choose to “discover” any open/secure items in the information vault.
- the vault services confirm the request to remove information.
- the vault services use the public key of the user and identifier to create a hash value to access the vault map to find the information and request removal of the information.
- the information is deleted from the vault.
- An audit log may be entered recording the removal.
- a charge is created as appropriate for the removal activity.
- the user may log off.
- FIG. 9 is a swim lane diagram of an embodiment showing steps of expiring information from a user account.
- the vault services periodically (e.g., on a pre-determined schedule such as daily, monthly or other time basis) or continuously as a background activity, searches through the expiration dates of stored information for all information to be expired in a certain time frame.
- a pre-determined time e.g., a week, month, or similar time basis
- users may be notified of any pending expirations. This notification may typically be an email notification or similar communication.
- the user may respond to the notification in order to disable or reset the expiration, or may allow the expiration to occur by not responding.
- the vault services locate all information that is scheduled to currently be expired at the pre-determined time.
- all information scheduled for expiration is deleted along with any associated metadata and contracts. The process may continue at step 900 .
- FIG. 10 is a swim lane diagram of an embodiment showing steps of deleting a user account, beginning at step 1000 where the user 400 and vault services 405 mutually authenticate one another (e.g., process of FIG. 4 ).
- a user may choose an account to delete.
- the vault services prompt for identification information.
- the user enters identifying information of the account.
- the vault may re-affirm the account deletion and if the user affirms the deletion, a hash is computed to determine where the information resides using the vault map.
- An audit log may also be entered to record the activity.
- all stored information associated with the specified user account may be removed and all contracts with the user's information as associated with the account may be removed. Any demographic data and financial information may also be removed as associated with the account.
- all user information associated with the account may be deleted from the vault map.
- the user may log off.
- FIG. 11 is an illustrative diagram of an embodiment of a second party contract, generally denoted by reference numeral 1100 .
- Second party access to user information may be controlled via the “contract” mechanism of this system.
- the contract 1100 is typically a data structure that may be created by the first party and given to the second party as a contract token that may be honored by the information vault 100 .
- the contract 1100 may contain information identifying the two party entities and the functional exchange agreed by the contract. For example, the contract may define whether a phone number or an address may be given to a second party. Or, the contract may allow the vault to perform other services on behalf of the parties.
- the information vault executes the required functional exchange after authenticating the integrity of the contract token and that the service requester is indeed the second party as called out in the contract.
- the contract defines the agreement between the first and second party.
- the information vault 100 typically executes this contract as the trusted third party.
- This contract 1100 may be held by the second party or deposited in the information vault 100 .
- the contract 1100 is digitally hashed and signed by the first party's private key, generally denoted by reference numeral 1120 . This allows the information vault 100 to ensure that the contract 1100 has not been altered since creation.
- the contract 1100 also includes the first party public key 1105 , the second party public key 1110 , and contract details 1115 .
- the contract details 1115 may include the agreed upon function(s) which may be read information, payment authorization, payment deposit, or similar information.
- the contract details 1115 may further include the communication security level, the time to live (e.g., an expiration date), and a usage limit count to control the number of times transactions may occur.
- FIG. 12 is a swim lane diagram of an embodiment showing steps of a second party contract fulfillment, beginning at step 1202 , where the second party 1200 and vault services 405 mutually authenticate one another (e.g., via the process of FIG. 4 ).
- a second party presents a contract 1100 to the information vault 100 for fulfillment.
- the vault services verify that the contract's token has not been modified by verifying the digital signature with the first party's public key.
- the vault services verify that the second party in the contract is the party presenting the contract to the information vault.
- the contract may be interpreted and the functions specified in the contract details executed.
- the vault services use a one way hash and the vault map to locate the associated information in the vault.
- the information is retrieved from the vault.
- any results of processing the functions of the contract are returned to the second party. Any data to be returned may be decrypted using the vault's private key and may be re-encrypted with the second party's public key. An entry into the audit log may also be made to record the access.
- any appropriate charge may be made for the transaction.
- the second party receives the information.
- the second party decrypts the information using the second party private key.
- the second party may log off.
- FIG. 13 is a swim lane diagram of an embodiment showing steps of commercial information deposit, beginning at step 1300 where the user 400 and vault services 405 mutually authenticate one another (e.g., via process of FIG. 4 ).
- the user chooses to “deposit” commercial information of a particular type into the vault.
- the user may employ a commercial data formatter applet (CDFA), typically downloaded to a user's computer, to build a commercial information item.
- CDFA when instantiated on the user's computer, guides the user to enter the appropriate information including any descriptive indexing information.
- the CDFA may prompt for an identifier (data name), expiration time, permissions, type (format), security level, keywords, owner ID (e.g., public key) and may confirm the information with the user and deposits the commercial information with the vault services.
- the vault services prepare the commercial information for storage and create the indices into a commercial information index 1320 and create a handle for the information.
- the commercial information is physically stored in the vault with the vault map updated with the mapping of the information item handle to physical storage reference.
- the indexing information obtained during the commercial data formatting step and the information item handle may be stored in the commercial information index 1320 .
- This set of tables may map the obtained indices to the commercial information item handle.
- the storing of the item in the vault, updating the vault map and the updating of the commercial information index is typically one unit of work.
- an acknowledgement of success may be passed back to the user at the browser and the user may then log off.
- the vault may store data on behalf of a first party that may be of interest to second party and made accessible to the second party (e.g., a business).
- the commercial index facilitates access to this data.
- FIG. 14 is a swim lane diagram of an embodiment showing steps of commercial access to first party information, beginning at step 1405 where the commercial second party 1400 and vault services 405 mutually authenticate one another (e.g., via process of FIG. 4 ).
- a commercial second party chooses to perform a query of the commercial information of a particular type.
- a query applet may be provided and instantiated for use by the second party commercial user.
- the query may be passed to the vault services by the query applet where the query may be executed using the commercial information index 1320 .
- the result set that meet the query criteria typically includes commercial information item handles and/or owner IDs.
- a confirmation prompt may be presented to the commercial user that may include an indication of the number of hits and actual cost to the commercial user.
- the fee structure may be based on fees to the vault and per item fees to the owners of the information.
- the vault services use the handles to determine the locations of the information via the vault map 230 .
- the vault services retrieve the information from the vault.
- information items are decrypted using the vault's private key and re-encrypted using the commercial user's public key and returned to the commercial user.
- An audit log entry may be entered recording the facts of the transaction.
- any appropriate charges to the commercial user based on vault fees and/or per item fees may be made, perhaps through the vaults financial backend interface to a bank, or the like.
- step 1450 credit to the information owner may be made for use of the information. This amount may vary significantly depending on the particular information “sold” and/or fee schedules. These fees may accumulate until a threshold is met and then the account balances may be applied to the owner.
- the commercial user retrieves the information and, at step, 1465 , the commercial user decrypts the information items using a private key.
- the commercial user may log off.
Abstract
Description
-
- a technique that allows information to be deposited in the vault;
- a controlled access method to remove this information from the vault;
- an intermediary service so that information may be effectively escrowed and then delivered to the appropriate party as needed as opposed to requiring the second party to store the information locally;
- a method to track consumers of certain information sets;
- an infrastructure that allows certain classes of information to generate income for the owner;
- a dual key safety deposit box for information such that only a specified party will be able to gain access;
- the ability to allow the repository to perform certain functions on the data of one or more parties;
- the technique and method to financially charge for the above services.
