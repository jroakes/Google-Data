Storage man position, this family position can be chosen so as to be directed to user its family, or may be used for maneuver and determine distance
The distance of the family of user.User profiles can also reflect the previous navigation request of user.
Familiarity rating engine 62 uses the description to maneuver and the specific data of user to come for each maneuver
Generation familiarity is marked.Such as, if reflecting maneuver in the past driving data of user, and if it is also determined that used
Family is close to family (such as, in 2 miles), then familiarity scoring may be the highest.In some embodiments, if familiarity is commented
Point more than certain threshold value, then familiarity rating engine 62 generates instruction user and is familiar with " being familiar with " signal and additionally of maneuver
Instruction user is unfamiliar with " being unfamiliar with " signal of maneuver.In other embodiments, familiarity rating engine 62 can be by
The scoring of " original " familiarity is sent directly to speech production system 44.
In some cases, familiarity rating engine 62 can receive and indicate driver have vehicle or renting
The signal of vehicle.Such as, referring back to Fig. 2 A, head-end unit 14 can by the information of identification (such as, VIN, at head
The machine address of the COM1 on end unit 14, serial number) it is supplied to mancarried device 10.Mancarried device 10 may determine that
The most whether it has been received by this identification information, and determines that based on this adjusting vehicle is the uncertain proposition rented.More
Specifically, mancarried device 10 can be by the identification information that will receive from head-end unit 14 and the identification in user profiles
Information is compared to make this and determines.In another embodiment, mancarried device 10 receives from other of head-end unit 14
Parameter, this other parameter indirect suggestion user may the most this vehicle of drive the cross.Such as, mancarried device 10 can by
The previous navigation request of reflection in user profiles compares with the previous routes being stored in head-end unit 14.Based on this ratio
Relatively, mancarried device 10 can adjust vehicle is the uncertain proposition rented.
If vehicle is rented, position can be classified as not by user by familiarity rating engine 62 in some cases
It is familiar with.In other words, when it is determined that generation " being familiar with " signal still " is unfamiliar with " signal, familiarity rating engine 62 can make
Determine as in several signals with this.
In addition to for " being familiar with " signals of various maneuvers and " being unfamiliar with " signal, when generating each audio instructions
Time, speech production system 44 can also receive the instruction of the current state of the head-end unit from depositor 74 and from depositor
The instruction of the current state of the vehicle of 76 such as, if the speaker of head-end unit is playing music, then vehicle head-end unit
State 74 be probably " audio frequency playback ".If coming from head-end unit currently without audio frequency, then state is probably " idle ".Separately
Outward, according to the volume of audio frequency playback, such as, " audio frequency is high " or " audio frequency is low ", it is understood that there may be individually state.Implement at some
In mode, according to the volume of audio frequency playback, play instruction can be carried out with more louder volume or more amount of bass.Such as, if head end
Unit is in " audio frequency is low " state, then speech production system 44 can generate the audio instructions of relatively amount of bass and divide to reduce driver
The heart.In the exemplary scenario of Fig. 5, vehicle head-end unit can be determined respectively for the corresponding time interval of each maneuver
State 74.Thus, head-end unit is in " idle " state for maneuver 1, " audio frequency playback " shape for maneuver 2
State, and it is back to " idle " state for maneuver 3 to maneuver 5.
Referring back to Fig. 2 A, the sensor in head-end unit 14, the biography in mancarried device 10 can be passed through respectively
The audio frequency input 24 and 32 of sensor and/or head-end unit 14 and mancarried device 10 determines the state 76 of vehicle.Such as, if
Vehicle is the most moving or be not " vehicle moves ", then the state 76 of vehicle is probably " stationary vehicle ".According to car
Speed, it is also possible to there is single state.In some embodiments, if vehicle is just to advance at utmost speed and at next
There is short distance before individual maneuver, then speech production system 44 can generate shorter route and guide.If the letter additionally, turn
One in number flashes, then the state of vehicle is also likely to be " turing indicator is opened ".In some embodiments, vehicle
State can be the combination of state of the speed of vehicle and signal for turn.
In the exemplary scenario of Fig. 5, familiarity rating engine 62 generates " being unfamiliar with " signal 64 for maneuver 1.Now,
It is " stationary vehicle " that vehicle head-end unit is in the state of " idle " state and vehicle.As a result, speech production system 44 generates
" length " corresponding with the total length text description to the maneuver 1 included at detailed route guiding 90 or complete audio frequency
Instruction 80.Such as, audio instructions 80 can be " turn left after 300 meters upper main stem ".
For maneuver 2, familiarity rating engine 62 also generates " being unfamiliar with " signal 66.But, vehicle head-end unit
State be now " audio frequency playback ", and the state of vehicle is " vehicle moves ".In this case, speech production system
System 44 determines that user has no time for the longest instruction, because vehicle moves, and user is listening music, Er Qieke
Can be not desired to be disturbed.Therefore, speech production system 44 generates short audio instruction 82, and this short audio instruction 82 eliminates to machine
Some in the text that the total length of dynamic action 2 describes.
It is said that in general, instruction can be shortened in any suitable manner, it is special that this any suitable mode is probably language
Fixed.In example embodiment, speech production system 44 is by removing nonessential information, such as, in the current location of vehicle
And the distance between the position of imminent maneuver instruction or follow the highway class after the proprietary name of highway
The instruction of type (" leading " rather than " main stem "), shortens audio instructions in due course.Such as, the detailed of maneuver 2 is described
Thin audio instructions can be " upper middle Yonge of turning right after 600 meters ", and speech production system 44 can export " central authorities in right-hand rotation "
82 are instructed as short audio.
For maneuver 3, familiarity rating engine 62 generates " being familiar with " signal 68.Such as, maneuver 3 can be as
The part of in the preferred routes of the user indicated by user profiles.When head-end unit is in " idle " state, due to
Familiarity and the vehicle of user move, and speech production system 44 generates short audio instruction 84.But, generating audio instructions
Before, next maneuver is also checked, to determine two maneuvers for a user by speech production system 44
The most familiar, it is also possible to these two maneuvers to be combined into the shortening audio instructions describing two maneuvers.
Further, familiarity rating engine 62 generates " being familiar with " signal 70 for maneuver 4.Speech production system 44 is right
The rear short audio instruction 86 generating description maneuver 4, and the interval between instruction 84 and 86 is decreased to zero.Change speech
It, short instruction 84 and 86 is combined into single instruction by speech production system 44.Such as, in conjunction with after audio instructions 84,86 permissible
It is " in right-hand rotation elm street and after 500 meters, be incorporated to No. 34 highways ".Speech production system 44 may then continue with pre-seeing additionally
Maneuver to combine more instruction potentially, until there is following maneuver: familiarity rating engine 62 is this machine
Dynamic action generates " being unfamiliar with " signal.
With continued reference to Fig. 5, speech production system 44 receives " being unfamiliar with " signal 72 for maneuver 5 and determines car
Head-end unit is in " idle " state.Speech production system 44 further determines that the turing indicator consistent with maneuver 5
It is activated (such as, by receiving the corresponding instruction from head-end unit).Such as, if maneuver 5 is included in relatively short
Carry out indicator ON of turning left and turn left in time, then speech production system 44 may determine that driver may know that and will turn
Curved, and audio instructions can be shortened.But, if maneuver 5 do not include turn, then " turing indicator unlatchings " state and
It doesn't matter for audio instructions, and be probably and just stayed from maneuver earlier.If it addition, maneuver 5 is true
Recognizing instruction, such as, " the turning left after 300 meters " after previously instruction " left-hand rotation after a mile ", then speech production system 44 is permissible
Skip this audio instructions completely.
For processing the example schematic diagram of gesture input
Referring now to Fig. 6 A and with continued reference to Fig. 1 C, 2C with for processing the skill of the gesture input in motor vehicles UI
Art, in exemplary scenario, paging gesture controller 49 processes gesture input and showing via touch screen 18 control item A to item I
Show.For the ease of illustrating, in this example, item A to item I is rendered as the identical figure of generally size and/or text element.
According to an embodiment, the size (such as, length, width) that paging gesture controller 49 receives touch screen 18 is described
Parameter, to determine that how many items in each item A to item I can be suitable for touch screen.In the example shown in Fig. 6 A, paging gesture
Controller 49 determines at most can show 3 items on touch screen 18.
Such as, each in item A to item I can be release, and it is emerging that this release describes with certain matches criteria
Interest point.As more specifically example, driver may have requested that display is along the cafe to the route selecting destination.Item A
Therefore each to item I can include the address of cafe, the photo of cafe, business hours etc..Navigation Service is applied
48 can receive and describe the data of item A to item I and data set is woven to orderly list so that item B follow item A, item C with
Item B etc..
Paging gesture controller 49 can be come item A in response to the input based on gesture received via touch screen 18
The display of subset to item I is updated.More specifically, paging gesture controller 49 is dialled in response to light or gently sweep gesture 110
Display layout 102 is updated to display layout 104, and dials gesture 112 by display layout 104 more then in response to subsequently light
New is display layout 106.It is applied to gently sweeping gesture 110 and 112 in substantially the same horizontal direction, but gently sweeps gesture
The speed of 110 is significantly larger than the speed gently sweeping gesture 112, as in fig. 6 by represented by the corresponding length of arrow 110 and 112
's.
In initial display layout 102, the set 120 of shown item includes an A, item B and item C.When user applies phase
To when the gentliest dialling gesture 110, paging gesture controller 44 determines the direction of gesture 110 and makes list advance to show bag
Include the new set 130 of a D, item E, item F.Then user applies relatively slow light gesture 112 of dialling, and paging gesture controller
44 make list advance includes the new set 140 of a G, item H and item I with display.Thus, in both cases, paging gesture controls
Device 44 guarantees in response to the light newly set dialling gesture display items, and dials the instantiation of gesture the soonest, when excessively regardless of light
To when newly gathering, item is not all had to be missed.
In this example, paging gesture controller 49 is further in view of the size of touch screen 18 or currently at touch screen 18
Upper available viewing area, determines and dials how far gesture list should advance in response to light.Similarly, if user will gently dial gesture
Put on the touch screen on mancarried device 10, then paging gesture controller 44 can be in view of the touch screen of mancarried device 10
Size determine and can show how many items every time.Thus, paging gesture controller 44 can be only by response to the lightest
Dial gesture be shown as to item: (item C, item D) and then (item A, item B), (item E, item F) and then (item C, item D) etc. travel through an A extremely
This set of item I.
In the example of Fig. 6 A, set 120,130 and 140 is non-overlapped.But, in other embodiments, these
Set can be overlapping so that the additional assurance not missing item is supplied to driver with certain controlled way.Referring to Fig. 6 B
It is discussed in greater detail this embodiment.
Referring now to Fig. 6 B and referring still to Fig. 1 C and Fig. 2 C, navigation Service 48 can show by ground via touch screen 18
Figure tile 1-A, 1-B ..., the interactive digital map of 5-G composition.Map tile can be embodied as specific scaling water
The square chart picture of certain flat fixed size.In this exemplary scenario, this series of display layout 200 includes initially showing cloth
Office 202, dial the light of gesture 210 and dial in response to light the second display layout 204 dialling gesture 210 and generate with in response to the lightest
Gesture 212 and the 3rd display layout 206 that generates.
Initial display layout 202 includes map tile array 220, and this map tile array 220 includes the first row tile 1-
A, 1-B and 1C, second row tile 2-A, 2-B and 2-C etc..In response to light group of relatively slow gesture 210, paging gesture controller
The 44 new map tile arrays 230 of display, this array only share with map tile array 220 row C (that is, map tile 1-C,
2-C ..., 5-C) and include new row D and E.Further, in response to comparatively faster light group of gesture 212, paging gesture
Controller 44 shows new map tile array 240, and this array only shares row E (that is, map watt with map tile array 230
Sheet 1-E, 2-E ..., 5-E) and include new row F and G.
Similar to the scheme of Fig. 6 A, paging gesture controller 49 in fig. 6b dials hands in response to dramatically different light of speed
Gesture makes the fixed amount that the advance of map tile array is identical, and this fixed amount depends on the size of touch screen 18.But, in the program
In, paging gesture controller 49 display continuously generate generate between result overlapping with by user will not because of light dial the fastest
And the additional assurance of the part of innocent omission numerical map is supplied to user.Additionally, driver need not try to light dial sufficiently fast
So that list is fully advanced, because paging gesture controller 49 will make map tile array advance fixed amount, even if gesture is the slowest.
It is possible if desired to each column map tile in fig. 6b to be taken as the item A to Fig. 6 A is to item similar for item I.By
This, can be considered as paging gesture controller 49 list operation with one-dimensional rather than two-dimensional array.But, if will be light
Dial gesture and vertically rather than flatly put on numerical map based on tile, then should be by the row of map tile rather than row
It is considered as limiting each.
