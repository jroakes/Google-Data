Definitions
- the invention relates generally to a method of and apparatus for coding and compressing information. More specifically, the invention relates to a method for coding and compressing digital signal data, such as digitized video images, for storage and transmission. While the following discussion refers to compression of digitized video images, it is to be understood that the invention is not restricted to video data, and may produce benefits in other fields where compression is used.
- video technology For example, one of the fields that has recently developed a need for intensive digital data handling is video technology.
- This field includes applications such as the transmission of real time video over telephone lines for teleconferencing and the use of digital video-transmission for home television viewing as well as interactive television and computer applications.
- applications such as the transmission of real time video over telephone lines for teleconferencing and the use of digital video-transmission for home television viewing as well as interactive television and computer applications.
- delta encoding One relatively simple compression scheme well known in the art is called “delta encoding”. Although primarily used in compression of digitized audio signals, several attempts have been made to apply the principle to the compression of image data. In delta encoding, a series of data values are encoded as a first value and a series of differences, or deltas, between each value and the next subsequent value. Delta encoding holds advantages when used in conjunction with lossless compression means such as Huffman coding, known in the art, which take advantage of the statistical frequency of values in a series to achieve data compression. The advantage of delta encoding arises from the fact that the frequency distribution of the differences between subsequent values in a series is often much less uniform than the distribution of the actual values, and in many cases this provides substantial gain in the compression of such data.
- delta quantization a ‘lossy’ compression process known as delta quantization.
- the quantizing function must include a means of choosing one of the allowable deltas if the actual delta is not equal to any of them; a simple and effective rule is to choose the allowable delta closest to the actual delta.
- VQ Vector Quantization
- MPEG MPEG This is a version of DCT with bidirectional motion estimation. It is very complicated, highly asymmetrical and will have digital artifacts.
- VQ is undesirable on the quality basis.
- the rest of the above technologies are simply too expensive.
- a reasonable implementation of the MPEG standard will require 3 million gates.
- a chip of this complexity is equivalent to the Intel Pentium or the DEC Alpha. Given typical yields, a 3 million gate chip is very expensive to design and manufacture.
- the inventors Rather than use complex mathematical techniques which require equally complex apparatus to implement, and which, in the opinion of many in the business of producing and distributing recorded and transmitted video material, produce unacceptable results at prohibitive cost, the inventors have combined a novel form of delta encoding with a method of image analysis to create a process that closely approximates the characteristic appearance of analog image processes, especially film.
- the visual effect of the compression process is similar, and perhaps superior to, the effects of the analog process being replaced, whether it be video tape recording, motion picture film, or video transmission via broadcast or other means.
- the compression and decompression processes can be performed relatively quickly so as to yield real time “on the fly” digital compression and decompression.
- an advantage of the present invention is that it can be implemented on a low cost custom ASIC, which could be installed in consumer products. Indeed, the present system can be implemented using less than 100,000 gates on a simple chip which is very inexpensive to fabricate.
- a method of analysis of the analog components of the video pathway including the analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog circuits used, enabling the designer of the system to establish an effective range of possible decoded values for given encoded values, termed the Decoding Range, relating to the noise level inherent in the system.
- a method and apparatus which incorporates a novel form of delta encoding, utilizing parameters based on the Decoding Range to introduce a pseudo-random element to the decoded values while maintaining these values within the Decoding Range.
- Two novel elements of the encoding process which were described in the parent application are named Asymmetric Delta Quantization and Two-Dimensional Delta Encoding. These two elements may be used separately or in conjunction to satisfy the objects of the invention. To elucidate the description of the invention, there follows a general overview of these two novel elements.
- Asymmetric Delta Quantization is similar to Delta Quantization, except that certain of the allowable deltas have different magnitudes when they are negative than the corresponding positive values. This introduces the pseudo-random element. Typically, the magnitude of the two smallest delta values allowed will differ by 1, such as ⁇ 2 and +1, or ⁇ 3 and +2, corresponding to a Decoding Range of 3 or 5 respectively.
- Asymmetric Delta Quantization includes the added benefit that the unequal delta values are chosen with non-uniform frequency, which can increase the compression level of subsequent lossless compression.
- Asymmetric delta encoding may be described in more detail as follows.
- a fixed value such as +2
- +8 will be transmitted for each delta falling in the range of greater than +5 and less than or equal to +14.
- identical fixed negative and positive values would be transmitted when the deltas fall in the respective negative and positive ranges.
- the lowest positive and negative output codes representing the lowest corresponding positive and negative ranges are unequal and preferably are different by an integer value of one.
- Two-Dimensional Delta Encoding expands the concept of delta encoding to include both horizontal and vertical axes. (Alternatively, one dimension could be temporal.)
- the Vertical Differential shall be the difference between a given input pixel value, and the decoded pixel value directly above it.
- Two-Dimensional Delta Encoding is equivalent in both dimensions; the same result is obtained whether we process from left to right in each subsequent row, or choose to process each column from top to bottom—neither axis is preferred or emphasized in any way.
- novel elements of the present invention are based on encoding of images using RGB encoding, where each pixel is represented by individual red, green and blue components. This form of image representation is the most common in consumer display devices which display digital images on a monitor or television screen.
- One novel element of the present invention is the ability to encode RGB pixels such that during the decode process, the individual R, G and B fields can be generated in a single operation. Integer wrap-around of the R, G and B fields is avoided so that standard subtraction and addition operations can be employed to operate on the three individual elements of each pixel value simultaneously.
- registers capable of containing multiple pixels are available, the same method can be applied to the encoding of multiple pixels, producing that number of pixels during decode, in a single operation.
- the encoding process ensures that no overflow conditions are ever possible at decode time for any of the individual R, G or B fields contained in any of the pixels which are simultaneously encoded in this manner.
- Two aspects of the present invention relate to the avoidance of overflow conditions within the separate fields inside pixels containing multiple individual components, such as RGB pixels. They are Encoding Lookahead and Large Deltas.
- the method of Encoding Lookahead is to modify the process by which a delta is selected for the encoding of a particular pixel, based on the effect that selected delta will have on the encoding of some predefined number of subsequent adjacent pixels.
- a pixel will be encoded such that for a predefined number of subsequent adjacent pixels, there exists at least one series of deltas which will prevent overflow of any component fields within those pixels.
- the method of Large Deltas allows for an alternate set of deltas which are larger than the normal deltas to be invoked as necessary, in order to prevent overflow of any fields within the pixel being encoded.
- Large Deltas also allows for an improvement in the accuracy of the encoded image in that the method introduces the ability to greatly reduce quantization error of pixels so encoded.
- Another novel element of the present invention concerns the manipulation of color images.
- Previous schemes including that cited in the parent application, have used the so-called Y, V, U colorspace of luminance and chromanance values to represent and manipulate images.
- the present invention uses a simplified color scheme of Luminance, Red-Green, and Blue-Green where Luminance represents the weighted addition of Red, Green and Blue, Red-Green the difference between Red and Green and Blue-Green the difference between Blue and Green.
- the Red-Green and Blue-Green components are sub-sampled at ⁇ fraction (1/16) ⁇ resolution, representing average color differences over 4 ⁇ 4 pixel blocks.
- First the Red-Green and Blue-Green components are encoded using simple Two-Dimensional Delta Encoding.
- Luminance Deltas operate on the Red, Green and Blue components of the pixel being decoded in unison.
- Color Deltas appear in the data stream, only the Red and Blue components of the pixel being decoded are affected.
- FE Fully Encoded
- IF Interframe
- Keyrows A novel element of the present invention which relates to Interframe compression is called Keyrows.
- Interframe compression methods have traditionally suffered from the fact that since interframe frames are dependent on other frames, usually the previous one, playback can only begin at a keyframe (fully encoded frame).
- Keyrows is a novel partial solution to this problem which takes advantage of the fact that Two-Dimensional Delta Encoding will reproduce correct information whenever the pixels above and to the left of the pixel being decoded are correct.
- the method of Keyrows is as follows. In every lnterframe compressed frame a row of 4 ⁇ 4 pixel blocks is designated as a Keyrow and only FE blocks are encoded for that row. In each subsequent frame, the row 4 pixels below the previous Keyrow is chosen. Even in the absence of any Keyframes, playback may begin at any frame. Within a set period dependent on the framerate and image height, the decoded frames are guaranteed to be free of defects.
- String Encoding is a statistical method of encoding that works in conjunction with the other elements described to further compress the data representing video images.
- String Encoding uses a best-match search method to represent variable length strings of symbols with other variable length strings in a fashion that allows near-optimal compression ratios and optimized playback performance.

- FIG. 5 A and FIG. 5 b are the Luminance and Chromanance Asymmetric Quantization and Symbol Tables
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of a digital computer run by software which can implement the present invention.
- the analog input signal will be considered a full bandwidth Red, Green and Blue color video signal, converted into a stream of digital values from a set of 32 possible values, i.e., there are 32 intensity levels for each of the three primary colors for each pixel or sample in the video image.
- the signal preferably does not contain the video information necessary for the maintenance of the video signal, such as timing and synchronization signals. These signals would be removed before compression, and generated locally during decompression.
- the present invention is concerned with the data portion of the signal or the portion that determines the brightness and color at each pixel or sample. It should also be understood that the present invention is not limited to video signals, but can be applied to any analog or digital signal, although certain aspects of the present invention find great advantage for video signals.
- the present invention in its representative embodiment, represents these digitized video images using RGB555 encoding, which allocates 5 bits of data each for the red, green, and blue image components.
- the resulting 15 bits may be manipulated using standard integrated circuit microprocessor technology, which typically use 16-bit or 32-bit registers. If 32-bit registers are available, the present invention may operate on pairs of pixels, producing twice the number of pixels per operation.
- the representative embodiment assumes implementation using 32-bit registers.
- FIG. 1 shows some of the general processes that are used in the practice of the Representative Embodiment of the invention.
- block 10 it is necessary to determine the noise level, or random deviation, inherent to the particular analog system in use (block 10 ).
- this deviation such as by imaging a flat card of one continuous shade.
- the digitized values would all be the same for the entire video frame; by analyzing the actual sampled values, the random deviation can be determined. For example, if the average sampled value were 100, the individual samples might represent a range of 98 to 102, resulting in a random deviation of +/ ⁇ 2.
- This random deviation indicates the acceptable range within which a sample value must be decoded to avoid a noticeable increase in the noise level of the image.
- This decoding range supplied to a system ( 12 ) which is used to select coding method parameters to match the random deviation of the system (block 12 ).
- the output of system 12 is supplied to data encoded block 14 , so that these parameters are then used to compress the data in block 14 .
- each pixel is digitized in RGB555 format; that is, there are 5 bits for red, green, and blue corresponding to each pixel. Furthermore, pixel pairs are acted upon in parallel by the use of 32-bit registers.
- the pixel format within such a register is as follows:
- FIG. 2 shows a schematic functional block diagram of a compression system for performing the method of a Representative Embodiment of the present invention and Table 2A lists the values to be generated by the system of FIG. 2 .
- a video signal containing data is input in some form (block 20 ), such as a camera, but it could be from any known source, such as a film scanner or from videotape.
- the signal is then digitized by an analog-to-digital converter (block 22 ).
- the input signal could also originate at this point from a digital source such as computer-generated animation sequences.
- a logarithmic or other correction can be performed on each pixel so that the random deviation will be constant over the entire range of possible pixel values. The result of this correction we call I, the Input pixel-pair value.
- the R, G and B components of each pixel of pixel-pair I are summed together. This is done in a weighted fashion, in order to compensate for the relative sensitivity of the human visual system to these primary colors, with G at 1/2, R at 7/24 and B at 5/24.
- the R, G and B components of Input pixel-pair values are subsampled on a block basis. Typically blocks sizes of 4 ⁇ 4, 4 ⁇ 2, 2 ⁇ 4 and 2 ⁇ 2 pixels are utilized. The processing is basically the same whichever block size is selected.
- Block 50 generates one set of subsampled values for each block, Br, Bg and Bb.
- Block 53 also produces Sc (Chroma Symbols), which are derived from the table in FIG. 5B (Chroma Delta Quantization Table).
- Sc is interleaved into the Encoded Symbol stream (at the upper left corner of each block boundary).
- a difference is generated by subtracting T (the Top pixel-pair value, which is output by the one-line delay at a block 40 ) from Ic.
- the one line delay relates to the generation of vertical delta values. This quantity is called Vi (Vertical input differential).
- Vp (Vertical previous differential, output by the one cycle delay at block 38 ) is subtracted from Vi to generate ⁇ V (delta-Vertical differential).
- ⁇ V is quantized using Asymmetric Delta Quantization, utilizing the parameters generated at block 12 , of FIG. 1 . This is accomplished by providing the actual ⁇ V to coding parameter block 12 which produces an output determined by comparing the ⁇ V field of each pixel in a pixel-pair to the list of possible deltas in the left column of FIG. 5A. A delta is chosen from the Small Deltas column with a minimum absolute value difference from the corresponding ⁇ V field. If this difference is larger than a predetermined threshold, or if the resultant Small Delta would cause a field overflow condition, then all possible combinations of Small Deltas and Large Deltas in FIG. 5A are compared to the ⁇ V field, and the combination with the minimum absolute value difference is chosen.
- deltas chosen are combined, by adding their values shifted into the appropriate Red, Green and Blue fields for each of the two pixels, into the value ⁇ Vq (delta-Vertical, quantized). If Large Deltas were used, these are similarly added into ⁇ Vq.
- the value ⁇ Vq is supplied to adder block 32 .
- Block 32 sums Vp and ⁇ Vq, generating Vo (Vertical output differential).
- Vo is summed with T to produce O (Output pixel-pair).
- Vo is also supplied to block 38 , the one cycle delay, for storage until the next horizontal pixel-pair is processed.
- O is stored for processing the next row of pixels. If a correction took place at block 24 , an inverse correction is performed on O at optional correction block 36 .
- the output is then sent to a Digital-to-Analog converter block 48 for display on a video monitor.
- lossless Symbol-to-String encoder block 44 Further lossless compression occurs at lossless Symbol-to-String encoder block 44 .
- the symbol stream S is matched against the strings in FIG. 2 B.
- the index corresponding to the longest matching string is encoded in binary form as E, the Encoded bitstream, and sent to block 46 , Storage/Transmission device.
- a pair of illegal symbols ( ⁇ 1, ⁇ 1) serves to limit the length of the previously chosen string.
- An index of 0 is then inserted into the Encoded Bitstream, and the encoding begins again at the next symbol.
- the encoded bit stream is saved to a storage device.
- the bit stream E could be transmitted for real-time video applications such as television transmission or teleconferencing.
- FIG. 3 shows a schematic functional block diagram of a decompression system utilizing the method of a Representative Embodiment of the present invention
- Table 3A lists a table of coded values which are generated at different locations on the block diagram of FIG. 3 .
- the image is processed starting with the top left pixel-pair, moving left to right and down each row until all pixel-pairs have been decompressed.
- the two delay blocks at 68 and 72 are pre-initialized to the same value used in compression (RGB 16 , 16 , 16 ).
- the encoded bit stream E is retrieved from a storage device and supplied to lossless decoder 64 .
- the bitstream could come from a data reception device in a real-time video transmission system.
- the bitstream is treated as a series of 8-bit ‘bytes’ corresponding to index numbers from 0 to 255. These indexes correspond to the symbol strings used in the Symbol-to-String Encoder, FIG. 2, block 44 .
- FIG. 3B a representative String-To-Delta Decoder Table is shown. This table is used to decode material encoded with the encoding table in FIG. 2 B.
- Each value (printed in hexadecimal notation) in the table corresponds to two encoded symbols (from 0 to 6). Each symbol corresponds to either a luminance delta as listed in FIG. 5A., or a chromanance delta as listed in FIG. 5 B.
- Chromanance deltas, dCq are retrieved from the table in FIG. 3 C and presented to Adder ( 66 ), where they are added to ⁇ Vq and Vp. Again, this only occurs at the top left corner of each 4 ⁇ 4 block of pixels. At all other pixel locations, Adder ( 66 ) simply adds ⁇ Vq and Vp.
- index 230 in the encode table indicates that the symbols 2 and 3 encode for two pixels, which make up a pixel pair. Looking at FIG. 5A, we can see that these symbols correspond to luminance deltas 2 and ⁇ 3 respectively.
- index 230 is encountered in the decoding process, we wish to add 2 to every color field for pixel 1 in the vertical delta register (Vp), and ⁇ 3 to every field corresponding to pixel 2.
- this value computes to (in hexadecimal) the number e73a1085, which is the single entry under index 230 in the decode table (FIG. 3 B).
- the chroma String to Delta Decoding table (FIG. 3C) is constructed in a similar fashion to the luma String to Delta Decoding table (FIG. 3 B). Since chroma deltas only affect R and B components, each 32 bit entry in the table in FIG. 3C contains red and blue deltas shifted into the two red fields and the two blue fields contained in that 32 bit register.
- the encoded bitstream is treated as a series of indexes into this table of 32-bit delta-pair values.
- the delta-pair is shifted to the right by one bit, and the value of the bit thus shifted out of the register is checked. If it is 1, the next index is retrieved from the bitstream and will be used to look up the next delta-pair. If an index of 0 is received, this indicates that the next delta-pair is a Large Delta, and must be added into Vp before the next pixel is decoded.
- the Large Deltas in this embodiment, are simply the Small Deltas multiplied by 5. Therefore, the delta-pair value is multiplied by 5, and added to the previous delta-pair.
- Another index is then retrieved and looked up to re-start the decoding process.
- the delta-pair termed ⁇ Vq
- ⁇ Vq the delta-pair
- Vp the delta-pair
- dCq the delta-pair
- Vo is stored in the one cycle delay at block 68 .
- Vo is summed with T (Top pixel-pair), the output from the one-line delay at block 72 .
- the output, O, of adder 70 is stored in the one-line delay for the next row. If a correction was made at block 24 (FIG. 2 ), an inverse correction is performed at optional gamma correction block 74 .
- the output is then converted into an analog video signal at digital to analog converter block 76 and sent to a video monitor for display such as at 78 .
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram showing a computer system which can enable the present invention to be run with software operating the computer.
- an IBM compatible PC with an Intel Pentium-90 processor is employed.
- Windows 3.1 from Microsoft is installed, with MultiMedia Extensions.
- Microsoft's Video For Windows Developer Kit is also installed.
- CPU 80 is connected to a bus which interconnects monitor 82 , RAM 84 , ROM 86 and a keyboard 88 .
- These elements of the IBM PC are employed to be programmed to perform the operations of the present invention.
- Another novel aspect is the ability to calculate an appropriate vertical delta for blocks encoded with Asymmetric Delta Quantization and Two-Dimensional Delta Encoding, using data from blocks in previous frames.
- a further novel aspect of this embodiment is the ability to encode images with alpha-channel information, providing partial and complete transparency as well as non-transparent pixels on a pixel by pixel basis. This allows real-time compositing of multiple, arbitrarily shaped images, including anti-aliased pixels at edge boundaries between foreground and background images.
- this invention possesses several important advantages over competing digital compression systems,
- video is not just pictures moving on the screen.
- the subjective “look” or “texture” of video and film, the grain and noise quality are extremely important to the artists working with this medium.
- Digital artifacts are obvious and unacceptable.
- the look of the image produced with the present invention is very natural and any degradation during the compression process is graceful and ‘analog’, without pixellation, jagged edges, blockiness or shower glass effects.
- Another aspect of the present invention relates to the manner in which error due to the compression process is distributed across the display to approximate the characteristic distribution of analog processes that is perceived as noise or grain analog film. This is achieved by the Two-Dimensional Delta Encoding process that tends to distribute the error downward and to the right. In this manner the error is distributed randomly in both the horizontal and vertical directions.
- a device implementing the present invention will cost less to manufacture and use than other alternatives, requiring at least an order of magnitude fewer gates in an ASIC implementation.
- the present invention will not require multiple frame buffers (other systems require 4-8 MB RAM), further reducing the cost of the final product.
- the elegance and simplicity of implementation make it possible to have a quick design cycle.
- the present invention is capable of compressing each frame of video independently. This means that true random access to any frame of video is possible: the user can instantly switch channels or interact in real time with stored video. A truly interactive non-linear environment is possible.
