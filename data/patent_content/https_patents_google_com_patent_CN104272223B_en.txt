The user equipment of the user equipment 100 of such as Fig. 1 can generally be bought, and therefore can be permitted global
Used in more country variants.Therefore, user equipment can be configured as with a variety of language and different character set to
Family shows information.Input Method Editor (or IME) is so that user can be by different language in-put to the soft of user equipment
Part application.Many language have the writing system based on Latin, such as English, Spanish and French.However, in the presence of
Many other language with the writing system based on different alphabets.For example, Russian, Bulgarian, Ukrainian and ripple
Blue pragmatic Cyrillic is write.In addition, such as the language of Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu is with corresponding alphabet
To write.In addition, some language of such as Chinese can be write with the character based on non-alphabet.
Many input equipments 104 of user equipment 100, which can be configured as to receive, input by user is based on Latin alphabet
The input of table.For example, many keyboards based on QWERTY are based only upon Latin language.As it should be appreciated, user may want to not
Using based on Latin alphabet or with language (such as Vietnam to the character that is extended based on Latin alphabet
Language) text is provided.Carry out inputting text into the second character set with what the first character set provided for this reason, IME can be configured as
Output text transliteration, the second character set correspond to output text object language.For example, user can be with based on Latin language
Alphabet the Chinese phonetic spelling of Russia's words and phrases is provided, and input text transliteration can be that be shown with Cyrillic alphabet by IME
Output text.
In order to carry out transliteration, IME can will input text from for example based on Latin using one or more Mapping standards
First character set of language transforms to the second character set, and the second character set is, for example, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic or the Chinese
Language.Mapping standard can be limited from the character in the first character set to the transliteration table of the mapping of the second character concentrated.In addition,
There may be restriction from the character in the first character set to the more than one Mapping standard of the mapping of the character in the second character set.
For example, it will be Cyrillic character based on Latin character transliteration to be used for there are at least four different Mapping standards.These
Mapping standard includes Library of Congress's standard, place name committee standard, 13652-78 standards and 16876-71 standards.Only conduct
Example, these Mapping standards are provided in table below I.

Many mappings in the mapping limited by different mappings standard can be identical.For example, Latin language arrives Cyrillic
" B " is mapped as by many Mapping standards in Mapping standardAnd " P " is mapped asHowever, Mapping standard
There are some differences each other.For example, character " TS " is mapped as by Library of Congress's Mapping standardAnd 16876-71
" C " is mapped as by standardIn some cases, the user of IME may more get used to the first Mapping standard, but IME is but
Realize the second Mapping standard.In these cases, IME, which may misread, releases input text.
In addition, Mapping standard itself may include fuzzy part.For example, according to Library of Congress's Mapping standard (Latin language
To Cyrillic), character " T " is mapped as " T " and " S " and is mapped as " C ".However, Library of Congress's Mapping standard will also
" TS " is mapped asTherefore, if user inputs " TS ", IME may not determine that user is intended to input " TC " still
It is intended to input
In addition, many language include homograph and homonym.Homonym is to pronounce identical and have the different meanings
Word.Homonym can include homonym, and homonym is identical and with different spellings the words that pronounce, such as
" break " and " brake ".When the sound pronunciation based on letter carries out transliteration and is replaced with the character from another character set
During character from character set, IME, may when user's input can correspond to the text of two or more different words
It can misread and release input text.
Therefore, it is proposed to the technology of the accuracy for improving transliteration.Although many in example provided in this article is shown
Example reference is from the transliteration based on Latin character set to Cyrillic character set, but technology disclosed herein can be applied
