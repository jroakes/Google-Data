- the conversation engine 110 can respond to a variety of requests from the client assistant 134 related to messages and return conversation-based responses via its connection with the communication network 104 .
- a conversation can include one or more relevant messages relating to a conversation topic.
- Various criteria can be used to determine which messages are part of each distinct conversation. For example, an analysis can be made of the contents of messages received and/or sent by a user. Messages whose contents are found to be related can be grouped together.
- a thread identifier found in a message header can also be used to identify related messages.
- a subject line in the message header can be used to identify related messages. The senders and recipients of the messages are participants in the conversation.
- All messages directed to a user of the information service 106 can be grouped into a plurality of conversations and presented to the user in a conversation-based format, individually or jointly.
- a conversation list view a user can see in a summary form a list of conversations in which the user participates.
- a conversation view the user can see in an expanded form one or more of messages associated with a particular conversation.
- the information service 106 can create a snippet of a conversation or a message.
- a snippet provides a user with a preview of the contents of the conversation or message without the user having to open the conversation or the message.
- the snippet can be generated from the most recent message in the conversation.
- the snippet can also be extracted from the first message (i.e., the oldest message) in the conversation.
- the snippet can also be extracted from all the messages in the conversation according to predefined heuristic rules, e.g., listing a set of keywords appearing most frequently in the conversation.
- the information service 106 can create a snippet for each conversation in the list, or for each conversation in a displayed portion of the list, the snippet including a portion of the conversation that matches user-submitted query terms.
- These snippets may be similar in one or more respects to snippets included in search results returned by a search engine, such as the Google search engine.
- a snippet can be generated for one or more messages in the conversation.
- the SMTP gateway 122 is also connected to the communication network 104 .
- the SMTP gateway 122 can be directly involved in receiving and sending messages between the information service 106 and other email systems, messaging systems or information services.
- the SMTP gateway 122 for example, transmits and receives messages using the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP).
- SMTP simple mail transfer protocol
- the SMTP gateway 122 can receive a new message from the communication network 104 and send the message to conversation engine 110 for additional processing. Additionally, the SMTP gateway 122 can receive messages from the conversation engine 110 and then transmit (via the communication network 104 ) those messages to recipient addresses specified in the messages.
- the one or more auxiliary services servers 120 can provide additional services to the conversation engine 110 .
- the auxiliary services servers 120 can, for example, include a spam detection module for detecting and processing spam and/or an attachment management module for managing the storage and retrieval of documents or other files attached to messages.
- the conversation engine 110 can be connected to the targeted information processor 124 .
- the targeted information processor 124 can provide targeted information for display to a user at client 102 .
- the targeted information processor 124 can provide, for example, advertisements and/or other information items related to content (e.g., messages or conversations) being provided to the client assistant 134 .
- the targeted information processor 124 can be connected to category information 126 which is used by the targeted information processor 124 to identify various categories as described below.
- the category information can be used to obtain, for example, category-related advertisements and/or other information.
- Category-related advertisements can be obtained, for example, from ad server 128 .
- Category-related other information can be obtained, for example, from information item server 130 .
- FIG. 1 is exemplary.
- the information service 106 contains a subset or superset of those elements illustrated in the figure.
- FIG. 1 shows the information service 106 as a number of discrete items, this figure is intended more as a functional description of the various features which may be present in the information service 106 than as a structural schematic of the various embodiments.
- items shown separately could be combined and some items could be further divided into sub-elements or parallel elements.
- some separate elements in the figure could be implemented by a single server and some single items could be implemented by one or more servers or modules.
- the actual number of servers in information service 106 and how features are allocated among the servers will vary from one implementation to another, and may depend in part on the amount of traffic that the system must handle during peak usage periods as well as during average usage periods.
- the message database 118 can be implemented using a plurality of servers if the information service 106 manages a large volume of messages associated with a large number of user accounts.
- the client 102 can include a client application 132 and client assistant 134 .
- Client application 132 can provide a window to be displayed on a displaying device (e.g., a monitor) for rendering conversations associated with a particular user.
- the conversations and messages in the conversations can be encoded using HyperText Markup Language (HTML), XML, or any other appropriate markup language or encoding scheme, and then rendered by the client application 132 .
- HTML HyperText Markup Language
- XML XML
- the information service 106 identifies conversations in the user's account in accordance with the user's request and transfers them as well as a set of display instructions back to the client 102 .
- Client assistant 134 can, in response, generate one or more forms in accordance with the display instructions, where each form can include information of some of the conversations. The forms can then be submitted to and rendered by client application 132 . In another embodiment, client assistant 134 may alternatively exist and operate in the information service 106 .
- the information service 106 and the client assistant 134 work in concert to allow a user to view, compose, send and/or search messages in a user's message account and to present the search results in a highly intuitive fashion.
- the information service 106 extracts information from a user's message account by processing messages received, sent and/or being composed by the user, and the client assistant 134 assists in rendering the information prepared by the information service 106 .
- a different division of duties between the information service 106 and the client assistant 134 can be implemented. Because many of the tasks performed by the system can be performed by either the information service 106 or the client assistant 134 or by the two working together, these two components are sometimes herein referred to jointly as the “conversation system”.
- the conversation system can provide at least two different views including a conversation list view and a conversation view as mentioned briefly above.
- a conversation list view a plurality of conversations can be displayed where each conversation can be displayed in a summary form.
- each conversation can be represented by a number of conversation elements.
- the conversation elements can include one or more of: a number indicating the number of messages in the conversation, a list of one or more of the identifiers or names of the senders of messages in the conversation, a conversation description (e.g., a subject line of the message), a date/time value of the conversation (e.g., a date/time value of the last received message in the conversation), and a snippet from one or more of the messages in the conversation.
- each conversation can be represented as a single row in the conversation list view.
- one or more messages from a conversation can be displayed.
- Each message can be displayed in one of a number of various modes, for example an expanded mode, a compacted mode, or a compressed mode.
- an expanded mode the body of the message can be displayed along with, for example, header information including names or other identifiers of the sender and the recipients of the message, a date/time value indicative of when the message is received or sent, routing information, and other properties of the message.
- An expanded mode can be used, for example, for messages which are marked as “unread.”
- a compacted mode the message body can be hidden and a snippet from the message is provided in its place. The snippet can be chosen to occupy less space than the body.
- a snippet can be chosen to occupy only one line in a display window.
- the compacted mode can be used for messages which have been read or marked as read.
- the compacted mode allows messages in a conversation view to be displayed within the same window more densely than if the expanded mode were used.
- a message can be represented with a small bar.
- the small bar can contain no message information.
- the visual effect of such a mode can be that multiple compressed messages appear like the edges of cards in a deck of cards.
- a user can toggle between the various display modes by selecting a message or using various controls in the display window.
- additional, targeted information can be displayed in the display window.
- additional, targeted information can be displayed in the display window.
- one or more advertisements relevant to, or related to, one or more of the messages in the conversation can be displayed.
- one or more other types of information can be displayed.
- Such other information can include, but is not limited to news items or links to news items, map links, phone numbers, links to product information, stock prices or links to stock prices, links to weather forecasts, web page links, dictionary entries or links to dictionary entries, images or links to images, RSS feeds or links to RSS feeds, links to blog (web log) events, links to user polls, links to files or other content on the client 102 , and other types of information.
- RSS feeds can be content distributed from various sources on a network (e.g., the Internet).
- RDF Site Summary (RSS) (and sometimes, Real Simple Syndication) is an XML-based lightweight multipurpose extensible metadata description and syndication format. RSS is typically used for distributing various types of content to a number of receivers simultaneously.
- News items can be news items from one or more sources.
- Blog events can be events generated from one or more web logs (blogs).
- User polls can be polls that the user may participate in which may come from a variety of sources.
- Stock prices can be stock prices of companies whose names or stock ticker symbols are mentioned in the conversation.
- Weather forecasts can be weather forecasts of locations like cities or states whose names are directly or indirectly referred to by a message in the conversation.
- the relevancy of the information item to a user in many ways depends on the contents of the input associated with the user.
- an advertising service returns advertisements based on text input
- the more closely aligned the text input is with a concept or category that is also associated with the returned advertisements the more relevant the returned advertisements are likely to be to the user.
- certain terms or word phrases are frequently found, but may not be useful in obtaining relevant advertisements.
- an electronic message from an on-line store notifying a customer that the product he or she ordered has been shipped might include, among other things, the product name and phrases such as “order has shipped”, “left the warehouse”, or “international air”.
- An advertising service receiving as input the entire message text including both the product name and one or more of these boilerplate-type phrases might inadvertently return advertisements related to shipping, warehouses, or international shipping. These advertisements, although relevant to the phrases, are probably of little interest to the customer, who is more interested in the product.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a process by which targeted information can be generated for one or more messages according to some embodiments of the invention.
- a conversation is identified ( 202 ).
- a conversation may be identified when a user selects a conversation to be displayed.
- a conversation can include one or more related messages.
- the identification at 202 can identify all of the messages in a conversation or selected messages in a conversation.
- Various criteria can be used when identifying selected messages in a conversation.
- messages can be identified based on the display mode of a message (e.g., identified messages are messages which are being displayed in an expanded mode).
- messages can be identified based on a time factor of a message within a conversation (e.g., the most recently received message is identified).
- the identified conversation can then be associated with one or more categories ( 204 ).
- categories include, but are not limited to, online shopping, shipping, travel, entertainment, dining, online auctions, health/beauty, taxes, real estate, computer software and hardware, and mortgages.
- the categories associated with conversations can include categories of things, activities, processes, concepts and the like. Some conversations may not be related to any category. In some instances a conversation can, therefore, have no associated category.
- a subset of the content of the conversation can then be extracted ( 206 ).
- the content of a conversation from which a subset can be extracted can include one or more of the following: a conversation description (e.g., a subject line of the message), one or more message bodies, a message sender domain, a message sender, a conversation label, one or more message labels, one or more message recipients, other message information, or information related to a conversation.
- a conversation description e.g., a subject line of the message
- the extraction can aid in obtaining information relevant to a conversation by, for example, excluding from the subset content elements in the conversation which may cause information not relevant to the pertinent portions of message to be returned from an information service (e.g., an advertisement service).
- a content element is one or more terms, such as a word or word phrase.
- one or more additional keywords can be identified ( 208 ), which can be added to the subset prior to the subset being used to obtain relevant information.
- These additional keywords can be dependent on a category identification, can increase a desired relevancy of the information returned from an information service.
- a “travel” category can be identified for an airline itinerary message to a consumer.
- travel related keywords such as “hotel” and “car rental”, when forwarding extracted content to an information service.
- the additional keywords can be content elements that are related to a category but may not be present in a message associated with the category.
- the content in the conversation can be used to determine which additional keywords are added. For example, an airline itinerary message to a consumer for an international flight may have “passport” and related, additional keywords added to the content sent to the information service, whereas an airline itinerary message for a domestic flight may not, even though both can be identified as associated with the travel category.
- the destination of a flight can be determined (e.g., by identifying or decoding a city, airport or other location code) and the name of the destination can be added to the subset.
- Information relevant to the extracted content is then obtained ( 210 ) from one or more information services (e.g., ad server 128 and/or information item server 130 ).
- the input provided to the information services can include one or more additional keywords identified at 208 .
- additional keywords can be used in place of content extracted from a conversation.
- the information obtained from the information services can be displayed with the conversation ( 214 ).
- the information service 106 can provide formatting information directing the simultaneous display of the information and the conversation in one or more transmissions to the client 102 .
- FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary process for associating a conversation with a category according to some embodiments.
- category content elements can be identified ( 302 ).
- Category content elements can be organized into lists of content elements, where each list can be associated with a category.
- each content element can comprise one or more terms.
- a category list for a category can comprise those content elements which are associated with that category.
- the number of content elements associated with a particular category are included in a conversation has reached a threshold, then it is more likely than not that the conversation belongs to that particular category.
- the percentage of content in a conversation which is associated with a particular category has reached a threshold, then that conversation belongs to the category.
- a conversation can potentially include content elements from more than one category.
- Certain metrics can be used to distinguish a most likely category from among categories that have some of their content elements present in a conversation.
- the conversation content can be compared against the category content elements ( 304 ) and the most likely category can be identified ( 306 ).
- the content of a conversation that can be compared to the category lists can be one or more of a conversation description such as the message subject, one or more message bodies, a message sender domain, a message sender, a conversation label, one or more message labels, one or more message recipients, other message information, or information related to a conversation.
- Category lists can be compared against a conversation content in a number of ways. For example, the number of times a particular content element from a category list appears in a conversation can be identified. In another example, each of the category lists and the conversation can be treated as a vector of terms and a comparison of a category list to the conversation can be a vector distance. When a conversation has messages that can include the content of a previous message (e.g., as might be found in a reply message), that previous content can be ignored.
- the most likely category to which a conversation belongs can also be determined in a number of ways. For example, a category having the most number of unique content elements present in the conversation can be identified as the most likely category.
- a category that has the highest ratio of the number of content elements which belong to that category as compared to the total number of content elements present in the conversation can be identified as the most likely category. If no content elements from any category content element list are present in the conversation, or if no metrics for any category are greater than a threshold (e.g., the number of unique content elements associated with a category list present in the conversation does not exceed a threshold), the conversation can be associated with no category.
- a threshold e.g., the number of unique content elements associated with a category list present in the conversation does not exceed a threshold
- FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary process for extracting a subset of the content from a conversation according to some embodiments.
- a category content element filter list can be identified ( 402 ).
- Each category (or each category in a subset of predefined categories) can have a filter list of content elements associated with it (i.e., a category content element filter list).
- Each filter list can comprise content elements which are associated with a particular category, but which, if included in the input provided to the information service (e.g., an ad service) may be likely to result in non-relevant information being returned.
- the information service e.g., an ad service
- a filter list for a category of “online shopping” can include the content element “receipt” and/or “your order has shipped”.
- a content subset can be created by filtering those content elements in the list from the conversation ( 404 ).
- Other content elements can also be filtered which may not be directly related to a specific category, but nonetheless may be likely to result in an information service returning information not directly relevant to the conversation.
- message header information and selected message component identifiers e.g., “To:” can be filtered from a conversations, regardless of the identified category.
- FIG. 5 illustrates another exemplary process for extracting a subset of the content from a conversation according to some embodiments.
- the process of FIG. 5 can be used alone or in combination with the process of FIG. 4 .
- a conversation can be examined to identify one or more patterns in the conversation ( 502 ).
- Messages from service providers can contain patterns within which can be embedded information specifically related to the service.
- an automated shipping notification message can include a shipping notification pattern comprising one or more labels and associated text.
- the labels can be common to many messages, but the associated text is more interesting from an information service point of view.
- the associated text can include, for example, the name of the product being shipped.
- a reservation confirmation message from an online dining reservation system can contain a pattern within which the most relevant information (e.g., the restaurant name) is embedded.
- the pattern can include, for example, the following text: “Your reservation is confirmed at”.
- an importance factor associated with one or more extracted content elements can be modified ( 506 ).
- An input to an information service e.g., ad server
- An information service can include information relating to the importance of one or more of the content elements in the input.
- an information server e.g., an ad server
- the output of the information server can be weighted toward those content elements deemed important and/or down-weighted for content elements deemed unimportant.
- One or more content elements associated with a particular part of a pattern can be accorded importance factors different from other parts of the extracted subset. For example, a content elements associated with a product name can be accorded more weight than other extracted content elements.

- an electronic document often includes one or more information entities that a reader may take further actions upon them while reading the document.
- the electronic document may be an email message that includes a new address of his or her friend who has recently relocated to a different city.
- the reader may prefer to include the new address in his or her address book immediately. Sometimes, he or she may want to obtain the driving directions to the new address. Conventionally, the reader manually copies and pastes the new address into the address book. This is tedious and error-prone.
- the electronic document and a set of predetermined information entity types are first submitted to an information entity server.
- the server is responsible for extracting from the document information entities matching the predetermined information entity types.
- the information entity server submits to one or more information item servers (e.g., ad server, map server, and weather forecast server, etc) requests corresponding to the extracted information entities to retrieve relevant information that might be of interest to the user.
- the relevant information and/or links to some of the relevant information are served to the requesting user together with the requested electronic document.

- FIG. 11 is a block diagram of an exemplary system 1100 that generates targeted information based on information entities identified in message content in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. Note that the client and network aspects of system 1100 in FIG. 11 are similar to those aspects of system 100 in FIG. 11 . Therefore, the following discussion primarily concerns the server portion of system 1100 .
- the communication network 1104 is connected to an email server 1110 on the server side.
- the email server 1110 may have a structure similar to the information service 106 shown in FIG. 1 .
- the email server 1110 is connected to an information entity server 1120 .
- the information entity server 1120 and the email server 1110 may co-exist on the same computer server. In some other cases, they may operate from different computer servers.
- the information entity server 1120 includes an information entity engine 1122 that receives requests from and sends responses to the email server 1110 .
- information entity modules 1124 , 1126 .
- Each module is responsible for identifying one or more information entities and collecting information related to the information entities from other sources. Generally speaking, these modules operate independently from each other in any order. In some embodiments, however, one module's operation may depend on the information entities identified by another module or modules.
- the information entity engine 1122 is configured to sequentially execute the modules in an order consistent with the dependencies of one or more of the modules on the prior execution of other ones of the modules.
- An information entity module may further include sub-modules: an information entity identifier ( 1124 - 2 , 1126 - 2 ) and a relevant information collector ( 1124 - 4 , 1126 - 4 ).
- the information entity identifier ( 1124 - 2 , 1126 - 2 ) is responsible for identifying any occurrences of an information entity type in an email message content and then forwarding the identified information entities to the relevant information collector ( 1124 - 4 , 1126 - 4 ).
- the corresponding information collector ( 1124 - 4 , 1126 - 4 ) makes an optional information request to one or more backend information item servers 1130 and/or advertisement servers 1140 to collect information items that are deemed relevant to the identified information entity.
- the information entity modules process the content of a message (or a set of message) in an arbitrary order, or in parallel.
- Requests to backend information item servers 1130 , 1140 may be made in parallel (e.g. during overlapping time periods), by the modules.
- requests to backend information item servers 1130 , 1140 are made sequentially by the modules 1124 , 1126 , in same order that the modules are process the content of a message.
- the modules After receiving responses to the backend requests, the modules associate the collected information items with the corresponding information entities and return the collected information items to the information entity engine 1122 .
- the information entity engine 1122 compiles the responses from the different modules and generates an ultimate response to the email server 1110 .
- FIG. 12 is a flow diagram of a process for identifying in a message content one or more information entities matching one or more predefined information entity types in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.
- the information entity server receives a message and a list of predefined information entity types ( 1202 ).
- the list may include, but is not limited to entity types corresponding to physical addresses, email addresses, common search phrases, billing statements, birthdays, predefined tasks, uncommon words or phrases, acronyms, phone numbers, object identification numbers (e.g., package shipment tracking numbers, International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN's), etc.), product names, company names, stock ticker symbols, movie titles, book titles, calendar entries, names of individuals (e.g., celebrities), city names, URLs, predefined event information, airline flight information, or any subset thereof.
- the list of entity types may include additional entity types.
- the information entity type list accompanying the message depends on the attributes of the message, such as subject, sender information, recipient information, conversation topic, etc.
- the list of information entity types is the same for all messages and is therefore known to the information entity server 1120 in advance of receiving the message.
- the following table lists examples of relevant information that may be provided, and/or potential action(s) that may be performed by clicking on link provided in connection with several types of information entities. Some embodiments of the present invention may implement only a subset of these examples.
- the server analyzes the message content based on the information entity type list ( 1204 ).
- the information entity server is responsible for analyzing the message content against every information entity type unless the email server instructs otherwise.
- the email server may determine for a particular message whether the information entity server 1120 should analyze the message to look for information entities matching a particular information entity type.
- the analysis by the information entity server includes identifying occurrences of each listed information entity type in the message content.
- An information entity module is invoked if one or more information entity types associated with the module appears in the information entity type list.
- information entity types that are closely related will be associated with the same information entity module. For example, physical address, email address and phone number are associated with a module responsible for any information entity type related to contact information.
- every invoked information entity module updates a data structure associated with the message and shared by all the modules.
- the data structure includes a list of annotations of the message being analyzed.
- the data structure has an interface that enables quick iteration by the information entity modules and quick lookup of annotations in the list of annotations. Annotations associated with a particular information entity type within a particular range of bytes of the message can be easily identified in the data structure.
- the shared data structure stores all information entities that have been found in the message so that each module can operate in a stateless mode, which simplifies the implementation of the information entity modules.
- a corresponding information entity module For each information entity identified in the message, a corresponding information entity module extracts it from the data structure ( 1206 ). Next, the information entity module submits an optional information request associated with the entity to a backend information source(s) (e.g., a map server) and retrieves related information provided by the backend information source(s) ( 1208 ). In some embodiments, the information entity module submits a search query to the backend information source(s) and the query includes at least one term corresponding to the information entity. From the query results, the information entity module selects the most relevant items and associates it with the information entity ( 1210 ).
- a backend information source(s) e.g., a map server
- the information entity server After all information entity modules have received responses to their respective requests, the information entity server generates an ultimate response containing all extracted information entities and their associated information (or a selected subset of the extracted information entities and their associated information) to the email server ( 1214 ).
- the response includes display instructions for formatting and displaying one or more of the extracted information entities and their associated information at a client device.
- an information entity module generates one or more links associated with the information entity.
- a link may contain a search query to a specific information source.
- the link could be a search query prepared for a product search engine like the Froogle search engine.
- the information entity module does not submit information requests to backend information sources. Rather, links are provided to an end user and he or she only needs to click on a link to get the relevant information.
- the information entity module generates requests as well as links for an information entity and serves both types of responses to the end user. For example, if the identified entity is an address, it may be desired to serve to the end user both a thumbnail-style map and a link to driving directions in connection with the requested email message.
- FIGS. 13A-13C , 14 A- 14 D, 15 A- 15 B and 16 contain screenshots illustrating the types of information entities that may be identified in an email message and the information and/or links that are served to an end user requesting the email message in accordance with some embodiments of the presentation.
- FIG. 13A is an exemplary screenshot of an email message including an address as well as links associated with the address and information corresponding to the address.
- the message body includes a physical address 1310 .
- This address is identified by the information entity server and extracted from the message body. The extracted address is reproduced to the right of the message body and displayed as a link 1320 to driving directions. A user clicking on this link will be directed to a map of the physical address as shown in FIG. 13B .
- this driving direction link 1320 is another link 1330 to update the contact information of the sender.
- a separate window FIG. 13C pops up with pre-populated fields 1350 derived from the message shown in FIG. 13A .
- FIG. 14A is an exemplary screenshot of an itinerary message including information entity such as city name 1440 “Cleveland, Ohio”
- information entity such as city name 1440 “Cleveland, Ohio”
- To the right of the message body are three hyperlinks 1410 , 1420 , and 1430 . These links are generated by the information entity server after identifying the city name in the message body.
- Link 1410 directs the user to a separate window ( FIG. 14B ) if he or she wants to add the flight information to his or her personal calendar. Adding the flight information to a calendar can enable the user to receive a reminder of the trip, or to share this information with other people who have access rights to the user's calendar.
- the calendar entry may include fields 1450 , 1452 , 1454 , 1456 , 1458 , at least some of which are filled with information extracted from the itinerary message ( FIG. 14A ), such as a title ( 1452 ), a location ( 1454 ), begin and end dates and/or times ( 1456 ), and a calendar entry description.
- Link 1420 directs to the user to a web page ( FIG. 14C ) including weather information for Cleveland, Ohio.
- Link 1430 directs the user to a web page ( FIG. 14D ) that includes hotel information for Cleveland, Ohio.
- the two links 1420 and 1430 essentially correspond to two search queries for different types of content. The queries may be directed to the same or different search engines or websites.
- FIG. 15A is an exemplary screenshot of an email message including a software product name “MS Access”.
- a link 1510 to a product search engine is displayed to the right of the message body.
