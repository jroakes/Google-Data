- the disclosure relates generally to the field of electronic media, and specifically to electronic book summarization.
- Reading a book involves a significant investment of time by a reader. As a result, it may take a reader many sittings over weeks, months, or even years to complete a particular book. Thus, a reader may forget important information about characters, place, items, and events within the book. Further, many readers undertake reading multiple books at the same time, making it even harder to remember what has already been read. For example, a reader may forget when reading fantasy book “The Lord of the Rings” that Galadriel is Arwen's grandmother.
- Searching back through a book to reread information can significantly add to the amount of a time a reader has to invest in reading the book. Instead of rereading portions of the book, a reader may attempt to discover the information by searching the Internet. However, this approach exposes the user to the risk of discovering information about portions of the book they haven't read, as well as the information they were looking for, as internet resources are generally sorted by entity (e.g., person, place, thing, etc.) rather than by the order in which they occur in the book.

- the summary subsystem 120 comprises an automatic summarization module 410 , a manual summarization module 420 , a presentation module 430 , and a feedback processing module 440 .
- Other embodiments of the analysis module 110 include different and/or additional modules.
- the functions may be distributed among the modules in a different manner than described herein.
- the automatic summarization module 410 applies summarization algorithms to electronic books in the literature corpus 140 to automatically generate summaries for inclusion in the summary corpus 130 .
- One such algorithm is described in “Sumatra: A system for Automatic Summary Generation” by D. H. Lie (Carp Technologies, 1998), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
- the automatic summarization module 410 generates a plurality of summaries for each electronic book in the literature corpus 140 .
- the automatic summarization module 410 considers a start point and a plurality of break points within the electronic book.
- the start point is generally the start of the electronic book, but other embodiments may use start points positioned after introductory pages, such as those containing a list of contents, forwards, and publishing information.
- Use of start points is particularly appropriate for books containing a number of independent works, such as a book of several unrelated stories, each of which may still be a number of chapters in length.
- the break points are variously defined by chapter breaks, page breaks, paragraph breaks, and the like, depending on the specific embodiment.
- the automatic summarization module 410 applies a summarization algorithm to subsets of the electronic book's content defined by the start point and one of the break points. For example, in an electronic book with three chapters where the chapter breaks are used as break points, the automatic summarization module 410 produces three summaries and stores them as part of the summary corpus 130 .
- the first summary describes chapter one, the second, chapters one and two, and the third, chapters one through three. In this manner, no matter how many chapters the user has completed, the summary corpus 130 contains a single summary describing what the reader has previously read.
- the automatic summarization module 410 rather than generating summaries based on a single start point, determines a plurality of portions of an electronic book that the user has completed. This is particularly useful for text books, where users often read the chapters out of order, or skip over chapters.
- the automatic summarization module 410 rather than producing summaries of the electronic book from a start point up to each of a plurality of break points, the automatic summarization module 410 generates summaries of all possible combinations of the portions of the electronic book.
- the automatic summarization module 410 generates seven summaries: three that describe the individual chapters; three that describe all possible combinations of two chapters from the three; and one that describes all three chapters.
- the manual summarization module 420 provides an interface for users to provide summaries of subsets of the content of electronic books.
- the interface is accessed within the cloud provider facility 110 by one or more system administrators.
- users log in from client devices 180 to access the interface remotely via network 170 .
- the manual summarization module 420 receives summaries generated by the automatic summarization module 410 and presents them to a human operator. The operator reviews the summary and is given the option to approve the summary, amend the summary, or provide an entirely new summary. Whichever option is chosen, the resulting operator approved summary is added to the summary corpus 130 .
- summaries are provided entirely by human operators using an interface provided by the manual summarization module 420 .
- an operator selects an electronic book as well as what to use to define break points (chapters, pages, paragraphs, etc.) and whether summaries should be defined from a single start point or for all possible combinations of portions of the electronic book.
- the manual summarization module 420 then prompts the operator to enter a summary for each subset of the electronic book's content, as defined by the break points.
- the presentation module 430 processes requests received from client devices 180 for a “summary-so-far.”
- the requests include an indication of a specific electronic book within the literature corpus 140 and a user's current reading position within the electronic book.
- the presentation module 430 uses the current reading position to identify the last break point the user reached and provides the corresponding summary from the summary corpus 130 for display at the client device 180 .
- the presentation module 430 uses other methods to select a summary from the summary corpus 130 .
- the presentation module 430 may provide the summary that includes the portion of the electronic book that the current reading position is within, or may do so only if the current reading position is more than halfway through the portion.
- the request for a “summary-so-far” also includes user preferences regarding summary type and format. For example, a user may configure a client device 180 to automatically request summaries that are in audio form. On receiving such a request, the presentation module 430 provides an audio summary if one is available. The user preferences further indicate whether a summary in another format should be provided if no summary in the preferred format is available, or whether the presentation module 430 should return an error to the client device 180 indicating that no summary is available. Alternatively, the presentation module 430 is configured to convert a summary into the requested type, such as by applying a text to speech algorithm.
- the feedback processing module 440 receives feedback entered via the feedback modules 320 of client devices 180 .
- the feedback received is in the form of crowd sourced ratings for summaries that the cloud provider facility 110 has provided to client devices 180 .
- the feedback processing module 440 uses machine learning techniques to adjust the summarization algorithms used by the automatic summarization module 410 based on the received feedback. Thus, the quality of summary provided by the automatic summarization module 410 is improved over time.
- the feedback processing module 440 aggregates received ratings for presentation to human operators (e.g., system administrators for the cloud provider facility 110 ). This enables the human operators to more easily identify summaries that merit improvement. Once a human operator has identified a summary in need of improvement, the manual summarization module 420 provides an interface with which the human operator can access the summary and either amend or replace it.
- human operators e.g., system administrators for the cloud provider facility 110 .
- the feedback processing module 440 utilizes feedback received from users to modify the summaries directly.
- feedback processing module 440 is configured to present the summary corpus 130 like a wiki at a client device 180 .
- a user can browse the summaries and make amendments that are automatically entered into the summary corpus 130 .
- the summary subsystem 120 of the cloud provider facility 110 sends amendments entered by a user to one or more system administrators for review. If the amendment is approved, the summary subsystem 120 enters the amendment into the summary corpus 130 .
- FIG. 5 a flowchart is shown illustrating a method 500 for providing a “summary-so-far” feature for an electronic book, according to one embodiment.
- FIG. 5 attributes the steps of the method to the summary subsystem 120 . However, some or all of the steps may be performed by other entities. In addition, some embodiments may perform the steps in parallel, perform the steps in different orders, or perform different steps.
- the summary subsystem 120 divides the electronic book into a plurality of portions. As described previously with regards to FIG. 1 , these portions can be chapters, pages, paragraphs, and the like, depending on the specific embodiment. In some embodiments dividing the electronic into a plurality of portions is merely involves reading metadata associated with the electronic book that identifies appropriate break points that have been previously determined.
- the summary subsystem 120 generates a plurality of summaries corresponding to subsets of the portions of the electronic book.
- summaries are ordinarily generated for subsets that correspond to all portions between the start of the book and one of the identified break points.
- certain types of book e.g., textbooks and collections of short stories
- the summary subsystem 120 determines which of the portions of the electronic book a user has already read. In the case of books with a single narrative described above, this can be achieved by comparing an indication of the user's current position with the positions of the break points between portions, as described above with reference to FIG. 3 . Once a break point corresponding to the current reading position has been determined, the summary subsystem 120 assumes that all portions previous to that have been read by the user, and all portions following that have not. Alternatively, in the case of books in which the reading order of the portions is less well defined, the summary system 120 relies on user data to determine which portions the user has read, as described above with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the summary subsystem 120 selects one of the plurality of summaries based on which portions the user has read. In general, the summary selected will summarize just the portions that the user has read. In some embodiments, the summary subsystem 120 provides user controls with which the user can partially or wholly override the determination made by the summary subsystem. For example, the user can elect to see a summary of the whole book, even if the user has only read the first half of the book.
- the summary subsystem 120 prepares the selected summary for presentation to the user at their client device 180 .
- preparing the summary merely comprises sending the summary via network 170 to the requesting client device 180 .

Abstract
An electronic book reader system is configured to provide a partial summarization of an electronic book, the electronic book being made up of a plurality of portions. A plurality of summaries are generated, each corresponding to a different subset of the plurality of portions of the electronic book. An indication of a specific subset of the plurality of portions that a user has read is used to select one or more of the plurality of summaries. The partial summarization is prepared from the selected one or more summaries and the partial summarization is presented to the user.
Description
- The disclosure relates generally to the field of electronic media, and specifically to electronic book summarization.
- Reading a book involves a significant investment of time by a reader. As a result, it may take a reader many sittings over weeks, months, or even years to complete a particular book. Thus, a reader may forget important information about characters, place, items, and events within the book. Further, many readers undertake reading multiple books at the same time, making it even harder to remember what has already been read. For example, a reader may forget when reading fantasy book “The Lord of the Rings” that Galadriel is Arwen's grandmother.
- Searching back through a book to reread information can significantly add to the amount of a time a reader has to invest in reading the book. Instead of rereading portions of the book, a reader may attempt to discover the information by searching the Internet. However, this approach exposes the user to the risk of discovering information about portions of the book they haven't read, as well as the information they were looking for, as internet resources are generally sorted by entity (e.g., person, place, thing, etc.) rather than by the order in which they occur in the book.
- A computer-implemented method for providing a “summary-so-far” feature for an electronic book is disclosed. In one aspect, the electronic book includes a start point and a plurality of break points and the method includes receiving a plurality of summaries, with each summary describing the content of the electronic book between the start point and a respective break point. The method further includes comparing a current reading position with the plurality of break points and selecting one of the summaries responsive to the comparing.
- In another aspect, the electronic book includes a plurality of portions and the method includes receiving a plurality of summaries where each summary corresponds to a different subset of the plurality of portions. An indication of which of the portions a user has read is also received. One of the plurality of summaries is selected based on the indication of which portions the user has read and the selected summary is prepared for presentation to the user.
- In one aspect, the comparing comprises searching between the current reading position and the start point and selecting a break point that is closest to the current reading position based on the searching. In another aspect, a subset of the plurality of summaries is created by one or more human users.
- In yet another aspect, the method further includes applying an automatic summarization algorithm to the electronic book to generate a subset of the plurality of summaries and storing the plurality of summaries in a computer-readable storage medium. In a related aspect, the method further includes receiving feedback corresponding to one or more of the summaries, and in a further related aspect the automatic summarization algorithm is a machine learning algorithm that is configured to take the feedback as input. In a further aspect, the method further includes revising the plurality of summaries responsive to user input.
- A computer system for providing a “summary-so-far” feature for an electronic book made up of a plurality of portions is also disclosed. In one aspect, the system includes a data store, a summarization module, and a presentation module. The summarization module is configured to generate a plurality of summaries and store the summaries in the data store, with each summary corresponding to a different subset of the plurality of portions.

- It would be advantageous to readers to provide a system enabling easy access to a summary of the sections of a book a reader has already been read, without exposing the reader to information about sections the reader has not read, which might spoil the reader's enjoyment of the book.
FIG. 1 shows anetworked computing environment 100 for providing such a “summary-so-far” feature for electronic books, consistent with one embodiment. Thenetworked computing environment 100 includes acloud provider facility 110 and a plurality ofclient devices 180, of which three are shown for exemplary purposes only. Theclient devices 180 and cloud provider facility are connected by anetwork 170. - The
cloud provider facility 110 makes books that can be viewed on theclient devices 180 available for purchase, licensing, rental, subscription and/or free download. In addition, thecloud provider facility 110 provides summaries of a portion of a book between a start point and a break point that the reader has already reached in the book. The break points may be chapter breaks, page breaks, paragraph breaks, and the like. For example, in one embodiment, if a user last stopped reading in the middle of chapter four of a book and requests a “summary-so-far”, thecloud provider facility 110 will provide a summary of chapters one, two and three. In other embodiments, the summary provided will include content from the book right up to the paragraph or word at which the reader previously stopped reading. - The
network 170 is typically the Internet, but can be any network, including, but not limited to, any combination of a LAN, a MAN, a WAN, a mobile, a wired or wireless network, a private network, or a virtual private network. Thecloud provider facility 110 is connected to thenetwork 170 through anetwork interface 160. - The
client devices 180 can be any computing device capable of displaying an electronic book to a user, such as desktop PCs, laptops, smartphones, PDAs, electronic book readers, and the like. As discussed above, although only threeclient devices 180 are shown, in practice there are many (e.g., millions of)client devices 180 that can communicate with and thecloud provider facility 110 using thenetwork 170. An exemplary client device is described in greater detail below, with reference toFIG. 3 . - In the illustrated embodiment, the
cloud provider facility 110 includes asummary subsystem 120, anetwork interface 160, a summary corpus 130 and a literature corpus 140. Thenetwork interface 160 enables the various components of thecloud provider facility 110 to communicate with each other internally, as well as with theclient devices 180 via thenetwork 170. Other embodiments of thecloud provider facility 110 include different and/or additional components. In addition, the functions may be distributed among the components in a different manner than described herein. - The literature corpus 140 comprises one or more data storage devices that hold a collection of electronic books that are available for access from
client devices 180. As used herein, the term electronic book should be taken to include all forms of media object with at least one narrative or experiential thread running throughout, including, but not limited to: electronic books; movies; and any other such entity. In some embodiments, metadata is embedded in all or some of the electronic books. The term metadata is used herein to encompass all data corresponding to a book that is available in thecomputing environment 100. - The summary corpus 130 comprises one or more data storage devices (which may be the same devices that make up the literature corpus 140) that hold summaries of portions of books from the literature corpus 140. In one embodiment, the summary corpus 130 contains as set of summaries for each book in the literature corpus 140. The set of summaries for a book comprises summaries describing the content of the book from a start point to each of a plurality of break points throughout the book. As described above, in different embodiments, the break points are distributed over one or more different scales, such as every chapter, every page and/or every paragraph.
- The
summary subsystem 120 generates and provides summaries-so-far for books for presentation to users at one or more of theclient devices 180. When thecloud provider facility 110 receives a request for a “summary-so-far” from aclient device 180, the summary subsystem selects a summary from the summary corpus 130 based on the specific book and a current reading position associated with the client device. The selected summary is sent vianetwork 170 to theclient device 180 for presentation. The summary subsystem is described in greater detail below, with reference toFIG. 4 . - In some embodiments, the
cloud provider facility 110 also collects and stores user data (not shown) such as a reading history associated with a user and current reading positions in one or more books. The storage of current reading positions and reading history as part of user account data enables, amongst other things, thecloud provider facility 110 to provide summary information for only portions of the book that the user has already read even if the user is using a different one of theclient devices 180. In one such embodiment, the user is notified of the intention to collect usage data and given an option to opt-out before any data is collected. - In one embodiment, if a user is re-reading some or all of a book (indicated by a current reading position at an earlier point in the book than the user's reading history indicates the user has read up to) the user is provided with an option for the “summary-so-far”to include information for all the portions the user has previously read, or only the portions prior to the current reading position.
- The entities shown in
FIG. 1 are implemented using one or more computers.FIG. 2 is a high-level block diagram illustrating anexample computer 200. Thecomputer 200 includes at least oneprocessor 202 coupled to achipset 204. Thechipset 204 includes amemory controller hub 220 and an input/output (I/O)controller hub 222. Amemory 206 and agraphics adapter 212 are coupled to thememory controller hub 220, and adisplay 218 is coupled to thegraphics adapter 212. Astorage device 208,keyboard 210, pointingdevice 214, andnetwork adapter 216 are coupled to the I/O controller hub 222. Other embodiments of thecomputer 200 have different architectures. - The
storage device 208 is a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium such as a hard drive, compact disk read-only memory (CD-ROM), DVD, or a solid-state memory device. Thememory 206 holds instructions and data used by theprocessor 202. Thepointing device 214 is a mouse, track ball, or other type of pointing device, and is used in combination with thekeyboard 210 to input data into thecomputer system 200. Thegraphics adapter 212 displays images and other information on thedisplay 218. Thenetwork adapter 216 couples thecomputer system 200 to one or more computer networks. - The
computer 200 is adapted to execute computer program modules for providing functionality described herein. As used herein, the term “module” refers to computer program logic used to provide the specified functionality. Thus, a module can be implemented in hardware, firmware, and/or software. In one embodiment, program modules are stored on thestorage device 208, loaded into thememory 206, and executed by theprocessor 202. - The types of computers used by the entities of
FIG. 1 can vary depending upon the embodiment and the processing power required by the entity. For example, thecloud provider facility 110 might comprise multiple blade servers working together to provide the functionality described herein, whereasclient devices 180 might be tablet computing devices. The computers can lack some of the components described above, such askeyboards 210,graphics adapters 212, and displays 218. -
FIG. 3 is a high-level block diagram illustrating aclient device 180 suitable for presenting an electronic book and a “summary-so-far” to a user, according to one embodiment. Theclient device 180 shown includes adisplay module 310, afeedback module 320, auser summary module 330, andlocal data storage 340. Other embodiments ofclient devices 180 include different and/or additional modules. In addition, the functions may be distributed among the modules in a different manner than described herein. - The
display module 310 receives at least part of an electronic book and presents it to the user on a screen. Alternatively, thedisplay module 310 presents the electronic book in audio form using either text to speech or a pre-recorded narration. In one embodiment, the user has pre-downloaded the electronic book from the cloud provider facility (e.g., by purchasing the electronic book from GOOGLE PLAY STORE™) and thedisplay module 310 accesses the electronic book fromlocal data storage 340. In another embodiment, thedisplay module 310 directly accesses a remote copy of the book stored in the literature corpus 140, via thenetwork 170. - The
summary module 330 processes requests made by the user via user input into theclient device 180 for a “summary-so-far” for a book currently being displayed by thedisplay module 310. In various embodiments, thesummary module 330 determines the user's current position in the electronic book by examining one or more of the following pieces of information: the portion of the electronic book currently displayed; user data inlocal data storage 340; and user data stored in thecloud provider facility 110. - In one embodiment, the
summary module 330 searches back from the current position to identify the last break point within the electronic book that the user has reached. Thesummary module 330 obtains a summary of the portions of the electronic book between the beginning of the electronic book and the identified break point from the summary corpus 130. - The summary can be in any form appropriate for presentation to the user at the
client device 180. For example, the summaries can include one or more of: text, audio recordings, pictures, videos, and the like. Thedisplay module 310 presents the summary to the user in a suitable manner for the type of content included in the summary, such as displaying text on a screen of theclient device 180 or playing audio files using one or more speakers connected to the client device. In some embodiments, thedisplay module 310 converts summaries from one format to another to present them to the user in a desired format. For example, in one such embodiment, thedisplay module 310 utilizes speech to text technology to present an audio summary to the user as written text. - The
feedback module 320 collects feedback from the user regarding summaries-so-far provided by thesummary module 330. In some embodiments, thefeedback module 320 provides user controls on a screen of aclient device 180 enabling the user to provide rating information for the summary, such as a score from a scale of 1 to 5, or a “+1” indicating a summary is of a high quality. In other embodiments, thefeedback module 320 provides user controls for the user to suggest amendments to the summary. The processing of user provided feedback is described in greater detail below with reference toFIG. 4 . - Referring now to
FIG. 4 , a high-level block diagram is shown, illustrating thesummary subsystem 120 of thecloud provider facility 110, according to one embodiment. In the embodiment shown, thesummary subsystem 120 comprises anautomatic summarization module 410, amanual summarization module 420, apresentation module 430, and afeedback processing module 440. Other embodiments of theanalysis module 110 include different and/or additional modules. In addition, the functions may be distributed among the modules in a different manner than described herein. - The
automatic summarization module 410 applies summarization algorithms to electronic books in the literature corpus 140 to automatically generate summaries for inclusion in the summary corpus 130. One such algorithm is described in “Sumatra: A system for Automatic Summary Generation” by D. H. Lie (Carp Technologies, 1998), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. - In one embodiment, the
automatic summarization module 410 generates a plurality of summaries for each electronic book in the literature corpus 140. To generate the plurality of summaries for an electronic book, theautomatic summarization module 410 considers a start point and a plurality of break points within the electronic book. The start point is generally the start of the electronic book, but other embodiments may use start points positioned after introductory pages, such as those containing a list of contents, forwards, and publishing information. Use of start points is particularly appropriate for books containing a number of independent works, such as a book of several unrelated stories, each of which may still be a number of chapters in length. As described above in reference toFIG. 1 , the break points are variously defined by chapter breaks, page breaks, paragraph breaks, and the like, depending on the specific embodiment. - The
automatic summarization module 410 applies a summarization algorithm to subsets of the electronic book's content defined by the start point and one of the break points. For example, in an electronic book with three chapters where the chapter breaks are used as break points, theautomatic summarization module 410 produces three summaries and stores them as part of the summary corpus 130. The first summary describes chapter one, the second, chapters one and two, and the third, chapters one through three. In this manner, no matter how many chapters the user has completed, the summary corpus 130 contains a single summary describing what the reader has previously read. - In an alternative embodiment, the
automatic summarization module 410, rather than generating summaries based on a single start point, determines a plurality of portions of an electronic book that the user has completed. This is particularly useful for text books, where users often read the chapters out of order, or skip over chapters. In this embodiment, rather than producing summaries of the electronic book from a start point up to each of a plurality of break points, theautomatic summarization module 410 generates summaries of all possible combinations of the portions of the electronic book. For example, in the previous example of a book where the portions are chapters and the electronic book has three chapters in total, theautomatic summarization module 410 generates seven summaries: three that describe the individual chapters; three that describe all possible combinations of two chapters from the three; and one that describes all three chapters. - The
manual summarization module 420 provides an interface for users to provide summaries of subsets of the content of electronic books. In some embodiments, the interface is accessed within thecloud provider facility 110 by one or more system administrators. In other embodiments, users log in fromclient devices 180 to access the interface remotely vianetwork 170. - In one embodiment, the
manual summarization module 420 receives summaries generated by theautomatic summarization module 410 and presents them to a human operator. The operator reviews the summary and is given the option to approve the summary, amend the summary, or provide an entirely new summary. Whichever option is chosen, the resulting operator approved summary is added to the summary corpus 130. - In another embodiment, summaries are provided entirely by human operators using an interface provided by the
manual summarization module 420. In this case, an operator selects an electronic book as well as what to use to define break points (chapters, pages, paragraphs, etc.) and whether summaries should be defined from a single start point or for all possible combinations of portions of the electronic book. Themanual summarization module 420 then prompts the operator to enter a summary for each subset of the electronic book's content, as defined by the break points. - The
presentation module 430 processes requests received fromclient devices 180 for a “summary-so-far.” In one embodiment, the requests include an indication of a specific electronic book within the literature corpus 140 and a user's current reading position within the electronic book. Thepresentation module 430 uses the current reading position to identify the last break point the user reached and provides the corresponding summary from the summary corpus 130 for display at theclient device 180. In other embodiments, thepresentation module 430 uses other methods to select a summary from the summary corpus 130. For example, thepresentation module 430 may provide the summary that includes the portion of the electronic book that the current reading position is within, or may do so only if the current reading position is more than halfway through the portion. - In another embodiment, the request for a “summary-so-far” also includes user preferences regarding summary type and format. For example, a user may configure a
client device 180 to automatically request summaries that are in audio form. On receiving such a request, thepresentation module 430 provides an audio summary if one is available. The user preferences further indicate whether a summary in another format should be provided if no summary in the preferred format is available, or whether thepresentation module 430 should return an error to theclient device 180 indicating that no summary is available. Alternatively, thepresentation module 430 is configured to convert a summary into the requested type, such as by applying a text to speech algorithm. - The
feedback processing module 440 receives feedback entered via thefeedback modules 320 ofclient devices 180. In one embodiment, the feedback received is in the form of crowd sourced ratings for summaries that thecloud provider facility 110 has provided toclient devices 180. Thefeedback processing module 440 uses machine learning techniques to adjust the summarization algorithms used by theautomatic summarization module 410 based on the received feedback. Thus, the quality of summary provided by theautomatic summarization module 410 is improved over time. - In a related embodiment, the
feedback processing module 440 aggregates received ratings for presentation to human operators (e.g., system administrators for the cloud provider facility 110). This enables the human operators to more easily identify summaries that merit improvement. Once a human operator has identified a summary in need of improvement, themanual summarization module 420 provides an interface with which the human operator can access the summary and either amend or replace it. - In other embodiments, the
feedback processing module 440 utilizes feedback received from users to modify the summaries directly. In one such embodiment,feedback processing module 440 is configured to present the summary corpus 130 like a wiki at aclient device 180. Thus, a user can browse the summaries and make amendments that are automatically entered into the summary corpus 130. In a related embodiment, thesummary subsystem 120 of thecloud provider facility 110 sends amendments entered by a user to one or more system administrators for review. If the amendment is approved, thesummary subsystem 120 enters the amendment into the summary corpus 130. - Turning now to
FIG. 5 , a flowchart is shown illustrating amethod 500 for providing a “summary-so-far” feature for an electronic book, according to one embodiment.FIG. 5 attributes the steps of the method to thesummary subsystem 120. However, some or all of the steps may be performed by other entities. In addition, some embodiments may perform the steps in parallel, perform the steps in different orders, or perform different steps. - At
step 510, thesummary subsystem 120 divides the electronic book into a plurality of portions. As described previously with regards toFIG. 1 , these portions can be chapters, pages, paragraphs, and the like, depending on the specific embodiment. In some embodiments dividing the electronic into a plurality of portions is merely involves reading metadata associated with the electronic book that identifies appropriate break points that have been previously determined. - At
step 520, thesummary subsystem 120 generates a plurality of summaries corresponding to subsets of the portions of the electronic book. For books that contain a single narrative (i.e., where it makes little sense to read the portions out of order), summaries are ordinarily generated for subsets that correspond to all portions between the start of the book and one of the identified break points. For certain types of book (e.g., textbooks and collections of short stories) it may be preferable for a user to read the portions out of order. In one embodiment, such cases are accounted for by generating summaries of all possible combinations of the identified portions. - At
step 530, thesummary subsystem 120 determines which of the portions of the electronic book a user has already read. In the case of books with a single narrative described above, this can be achieved by comparing an indication of the user's current position with the positions of the break points between portions, as described above with reference toFIG. 3 . Once a break point corresponding to the current reading position has been determined, thesummary subsystem 120 assumes that all portions previous to that have been read by the user, and all portions following that have not. Alternatively, in the case of books in which the reading order of the portions is less well defined, thesummary system 120 relies on user data to determine which portions the user has read, as described above with reference toFIG. 3 . - At
step 540, thesummary subsystem 120 selects one of the plurality of summaries based on which portions the user has read. In general, the summary selected will summarize just the portions that the user has read. In some embodiments, thesummary subsystem 120 provides user controls with which the user can partially or wholly override the determination made by the summary subsystem. For example, the user can elect to see a summary of the whole book, even if the user has only read the first half of the book. - At
step 550, thesummary subsystem 120 prepares the selected summary for presentation to the user at theirclient device 180. In some embodiments preparing the summary merely comprises sending the summary vianetwork 170 to the requestingclient device 180. In other embodiments, the summary obtained from the summary corpus 130 is processed to convert the summary into a format more appropriate for presentation at the requestingclient device 180. Such processing may include performing text to speech conversion, performing speech to text conversion, converting between file formats, changing a video aspect ratio, and any other such processing that enables more efficient presentation of the summary byclient device 180. - In this description, the term “module” refers to computational logic for providing the specified functionality. A module can be implemented in hardware, firmware, and/or software. Where the modules described herein are implemented as software, the module can be implemented as a standalone program, but can also be implemented through other means, for example as part of a larger program, as a plurality of separate programs, or as one or more statically or dynamically linked libraries. It will be understood that the named modules described herein represent one embodiment of the present invention, and other embodiments may include other modules. In addition, other embodiments may lack modules described herein and/or distribute the described functionality among the modules in a different manner. Additionally, the functionalities attributed to more than one module can be incorporated into a single module.
- In an embodiment where the modules as implemented by software, they are stored on a computer readable persistent storage device (e.g., hard disk), loaded into the memory, and executed by one or more processors included as part of a
client device 180 and/orcloud provider facility 110. Alternatively, hardware or software modules may be stored elsewhere within thenetworked computing environment 100. Thenetworked computing environment 100 includes hardware elements necessary for the operations described here, including one or more processors, high speed memory, hard disk storage and backup, network interfaces and protocols, input devices for data entry, and output devices for display, printing, or other presentations of data. - Numerous variations from the system architecture of the illustrated
computing environment 100 are possible. The components of theenvironment 100 and their respective functionalities can be combined or redistributed. For example, the literature corpus 140 can be distributed among any number of physical devices. - As used herein any reference to “one embodiment” or “an embodiment” means that a particular element, feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. The appearances of the phrase “in one embodiment” in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.
