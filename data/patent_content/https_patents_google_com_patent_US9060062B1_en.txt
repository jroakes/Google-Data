- FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary architecture diagram for the disclosed customer service techniques.
- a number of self-help systems are provided.
- the available self-help systems include online forum 120 , web server 130 , search engine 140 , and email server 150 . Each offers a different channel of communication for customer 110 .
- Online forum 120 provides a mechanism by which customers are able to, via a web browser, create and review topics relating to the product or service, often relating to issues customers have encountered. Within these topics, customers may exchange comments, such as resolutions for such issues, or further details about their issues. Additionally, customer service representatives (CSRs) and/or product developers may participate in the discussion of topics, to provide feedback or solutions to customer issues.
- CSRs customer service representatives
- Various forum systems are well known and understood in the art, including bulletin board systems.
- Web server 130 provides a web browser-accessible service by which customer 110 may review information published by the product or service provider, such as help pages directed to and addressing particular topics and issues commonly experienced by customers. Typically, such information is accessed as individual web pages, each having a unique identifier or address.
- online forum 120 and web server 130 may present information in a fairly accessible and structured manner to facilitate the location of information therein, commonly such services are supplemented with a customer-accessible search engine 140 .
- Information available via online forum 120 and web server 130 is indexed, and thereby made searchable via search engine 140 .
- search engine 140 may also allow searching through information indexed from a plurality of sources, to provide a mechanism for customer 110 to search more generally for information.
- Customer 110 typically via web browser, submits a query, typically a textual query, to search engine 140 .
- Search engine 140 identifies information items from the information it has indexed, and presents a list of results to customer 110 , with each listed result presenting a brief summary of, and a hyperlink to, its respective information item. Using the web browser, customer 110 may follow a hyperlink to review the information item (e.g., a web page available via web server 130 or a forum posting via online forum 120 ). In this way, search engine 140 provides an efficient and familiar interface that allows customer 110 to more quickly locate information helpful for resolving an issue.
- Customer 110 may also seek assistance by sending a email, which is received by email server 150 .
- emails may be processed manually by a customer service representative (CSR), and/or they may be automatically processed by a machine system that seeks to identify the issue experienced by customer 110 , and a corresponding solution for the identified issue, which is sent to customer 110 by reply email.
- CSR customer service representative
- Classifier 155 which will be discussed in more detail below, may be used to identify the issue experienced by customer 110 , or classifier 155 may utilize an issue identification rendered by another component dedicated to handling customer emails.
- Each of the self-help systems 120 , 130 , 140 , and 150 have respective classifiers 125 , 135 , 145 , and 155 .
- separate classifier systems are provided for each channel of communication, in order to accommodate unique architectural considerations for their respective self-help systems or due to specific processing applied for each channel of communication.
- a single, generally product-specific, system may perform classification for more than one, or even all, of self-help systems 120 , 130 , 140 , and 150 .
- customer 110 makes use of a self-help system, such as by viewing a particular web page via web server 130 , information regarding that usage is communicated to the respective classifier. Based on the received information, the classifier will classify the use.
- the classifier submits information, including a customer identifier, information about the use of the self-help system and the classification of the use rendered by the classifier, to customer communication storage 170 , which stores such information for later use.
- customer communication storage 170 will store such information for a limited and predetermined period of time, as typically only recent use of self-help systems 120 , 130 , 140 , and 150 is useful for facilitating customer service interactions.
- classifiers 125 , 135 , 145 , and 155 each employ machine learning techniques to perform automatic machine-based classification of information. As a product typically has issues specific to that particular product, the classifiers must be trained, and a collection of classifications, such as cluster labels, identified for various issues (e.g., “cannot see my advertisement’ and ‘forgot password’). Where separate classifiers are used, a common set of classifications is identified to allow various uses of different self-help channels to still be grouped together. This common set of classifiers is utilized as predefined classifications for customer support issues which are commonly used by the separate classifiers for classifying customer communications, although there may be other classifications unique to various classifiers.
- classifications such as cluster labels
- Training of a classification algorithm performed by a classifier is performed by starting with a large collection of customer uses of the self-help systems associated with the classifier (which may be collected and stored using customer communication storage 170 ). This collection of data is used to train the classifier, which automatically identifies and generates a plurality of classifications, such as cluster labels. Afterwards, as noted above, consistent classifications are used across all of the classifiers. Initially, establishing common classifications may require manual effort, involving human review of classifications, determining where multiple classifications should be combined into a single classification, and deciding upon uniform labels (where used) across the classifications. In some embodiments, later on an additional classification process may be applied to automatically create a common set of classifications. In some circumstances, new classifications may be identified based on recurring issues that are not currently being identified or distinguished. Such new classifications are specifically noted, and sample corresponding customer communications provided, to a classifier for “retraining” for recognition of future communications within the new classifications.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a process 400 by which a common set of classifications is generated for communications processed via multiple communication services.
- a first plurality of classifications for customer issues corresponding to a plurality of customer communications processed via a first communication service is automatically determined.
- a second plurality of classifications for customer issues corresponding to a plurality of customer communications processed via a second communication service is automatically determined.
- a plurality of common classifications for customer issues is determined based on the first plurality of categories and the second plurality of categories.
- at least a first classification, included in the plurality of common classifications is automatically associated with a first communication processed via the first communication service.
- at least a second classification, included in the plurality of common classifications is automatically associated with a second communication processed via the second communication service.
- customer 110 may be directed to discuss the issue with CSR 160 .
- Customer 110 may contact CSR 160 , for example, via telephone, instant messaging, or a “chat” interface via a web browser for text-based communication.
- CSR 160 makes use of customer service system 165 .
- Customer service system 165 provides CSR 160 with information including, for example, detailed information about an account for customer 110 , previous discussions between customer 110 and other CSRs, and information about recent use of self-help systems 120 , 130 , 140 , and 150 provided by customer communication storage 170 . Use and operation of customer service system 165 is discussed in more detail below.
- FIG. 2A illustrates a process 200 by which information is recorded by customer communication storage 170 regarding use of web server 130 .
- information provided via web server 130 may be accessed by customer 110 as individual web pages, each associated with a unique identifier or address.
- the content of the web pages made available via web server 130 is classified in advance.
- classifier 135 obtains contents of web pages made available via web server 130 , and obtains classifications, such as cluster labels, for each of the web pages. Then, classifier 135 records the obtained classifications in association with their respective web pages. This may, for example, be stored in a database by classifier 135 , or stored in conjunction with the web pages by web server 130 .
- web server 130 processes a request from customer 110 for a particular web page.
- classifier 135 obtains classifications, such as cluster labels, associated with the requested web page. In circumstances where dynamic classification is used, classifier 135 processes content of the requested web page to obtain the classifications. In some situations, once classifier 135 performs dynamic classification for a web page, classifier 135 may retain this information for use for future requests of the web page. This similarly applies to classifications dynamically obtained by classifiers 125 (online forum), 145 (search engine), and 155 (email).
- customer communication storage 170 records information such as, for example, an identification for customer 110 , an identifier for the particular web page that customer 110 accessed, the classifications obtained for the web page, and a date and time at which customer 110 requested the web page.
- steps 201 - 204 may also be performed for other digital content made available via web server 130 .
- the information recorded by customer communication storage 170 is later accessible to other systems, such as customer service system 165 , as illustrated below in relation to FIG. 3 .
- FIG. 2B illustrates a process 220 by which information is recorded by customer communication storage 170 regarding use of online forum 120 .
- online forum processes a request from customer 110 for the content of a forum topic or a request to create a new forum topic while visiting online forum 120 via, for example, a web browser.
- a listing a topics, with accompanying titles and/or summaries is presented, from which customer 110 can request the content of a particular forum topic to review postings made under the selected topic.
- customer 110 may create a new topic for discussion.
- a topic When a topic is created, it generally includes a title and a description, often presented as a first post under the topic, of the issue discussed in the topic.
- This information may be used, in step 222 , by classifier 125 to obtain classifications, such as cluster labels, for the topic selected or created by customer 110 .
- step 222 may be performed in response to a notification from online forum 120 to classifier 125 .
- other posts and information e.g., a title and description for the topic
- other posts and information included in the topic are also used by classifier 125 to obtain the classifications.
- customer communication storage 170 records information such as, for example, an identification associated with customer 110 , an identifier for the topic selected by customer 110 , the classifications obtained in step 222 for the selected or created topic, and a date and time at which customer 110 selected or created the topic. In some embodiments, customer communication storage 170 may also specifically record whether customer 110 created the topic.
- posts submitted under topics are also classified.
- online forum 120 processes a submission of a new post under an existing topic by customer 110 .
- classifier 125 obtains classifications, such as cluster labels, for the new post.
- step 225 may be initiated by a notification from online forum 120 to classifier 125 .
- customer communication storage 170 records information such as, for example, an identification for customer 110 , an identifier for the post submitted by customer 110 , the classifications obtained in step 225 for the new post, and the date and time at which customer 110 submitted the post.
- FIG. 2C illustrates a process 240 by which information is recorded by customer communication storage 170 regarding emails received by email server 150 .
- email server 150 processes an email with a support inquiry sent by customer 110 received by email server 150 .
- classifier 155 performs text-based classification upon content of the email, such as the subject and body portions of the email, to obtain one or more classifications, such as group labels, associated with the email.
- classifications such as group labels
- Classifier 155 may generate classification categories based upon classifications performed by the automated reply system; for example, classifier 155 may group multiple narrow classifications generated by the automated reply system into a single broader classification category, or classifier 155 may simply convert an individual classification by automated reply system into one of the common classification categories for use by customer communication storage 170 .
- the automated reply system may rely on classifier 155 to perform classification by selecting a pre-generated response based on the classifications obtained by classifier 155 in step 242 , and perform little or no classification of emails itself.
- customer communication storage 170 records information such as, for example, an identification for customer 110 , an identifier for the email submitted by customer 110 , the classifications obtained for the email, and a date and time at which the email was sent or received.
- the techniques illustrated with respect to FIG. 2C may similarly be applied to other customer text-based support-related inquiries, such as SMS messages, instant messages, and inquiries submitted via a web browser.
- FIG. 2D illustrates a process 260 by which information is recorded by customer communication storage 170 regarding use of search engine 140 .
- search engine 140 may be provided, for example, for online forum 120 , enabling customer 110 to search through topics and posts; for web server 130 , enabling customer 110 to search through web pages made available via web server 130 ; or as a search engine for information indexed from a plurality of sources, enabling customer 110 to search more generally for information.
- search engine 140 processes a search query issued by customer 110 .
- classifier 145 generates classifications, such as cluster labels, for the search query. Often, search queries are only a few words long.
- search engine 140 may, as part of its search processing, perform classification of the submitted query and/or results obtained for the search query. Classification categories used by classifier 155 may be based on such classifications generated during the search processing, in order to take advantage of classification already performed by search engine 140 .
- customer communication storage 170 records information such as, for example, an identification for customer 110 , the search query submitted by customer 110 , the classifications obtained for the search query, and a date and time at which the search query was received or processed.
- step 264 results for the search responsive to the search query are provided to customer 110 .
- a listing of results is displayed, with each result including a brief description to allow customer 110 to assess its relevance from the displayed listing, and a hyperlink to allow the full information for the result (e.g., a web page) be obtained.
- steps 265 - 267 may be performed.
- search engine 140 processes an indication that customer 110 selected a particular search result (which typically indicates the hyperlink associated with the result was followed by the web browser used by customer 110 ).
- step 266 classifications are obtained for the selected result.
- the obtained classifications might be based upon classifications performed by search engine 140 , either during search processing or initial indexing of the information associated with the search result.
- customer communication storage 170 records information such as, for example, an identification for customer 110 , an identifier for the search result selected by customer 110 , the classifications associated with the selected search result, and a date and time at which the result was selected.
- the search query may also be recorded with this information.
- steps 265 - 267 or steps 266 - 267 are not necessary.
- search engine 140 is provided for online forum 120
- each of the results lead to topics managed by online forum 120
- classifier 125 will record any visits by customer 110 to these topics; thus, it would be redundant to classify and record selected search results as discussed above with respect to steps 265 - 267 .
- Online forum 120 web server 130 , search engine 140 , and email server 150 merely provide examples of sources of information for customer communication storage 170 , and those skilled in the art appreciate that other systems that customer 110 interacts with can similarly be applied.
- speech-to-text processing may be performed on verbal communication, such as a telephone call with customer 110 , and the resultant text may be classified.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a process 300 by which a customer 110 interacts with customer communication storage 170 and a customer service representative (CSR) 160 making use of customer service system 165 .
- CSR customer service representative
- a first customer communication is processed via, for example, online forum 120 , web server 130 , search engine 140 , or email server 150 , as illustrated above with respect to FIGS. 2A-2D .
- a second customer communication is processed via, for example, online forum 120 , web server 130 , search engine 140 , or email server 150 , as illustrated above with respect to FIGS. 2A-2D .
- customer 110 contacts CSR 160 after having utilized one or more of self-help services 120 , 130 , 140 , and 150 .
- customer service system 165 obtains records stored by customer communication storage 170 in relation to customer 110 .
- the requested or obtained records may be restricted to a specified or predetermined period of time, such as the 3 hours immediately preceding customer 110 contacting CSR 160 , in order to direction the attention of CSR 160 on what is most likely the immediate issue for customer 110 .
- information for the records is displayed to CSR 160 in conjunction with their respective classifications.
- the records may be displayed to CSR 160 via a web browser.
- the records and the classifications may be presented to CSR 160 .
- the records may be presented in reverse chronological order (i.e., the most recent record first) with text labels corresponding to the classifications (in some embodiments, there may be human-readable text labels associated with classifications).
- records may be grouped according associated classifications to allow CSR 160 to more quickly identify for which classification there has been the most significant activity.
- a text label for a classification may be selected, in response to which a more detailed description or explanation of the classifications may be made available for CSR 160 to review.
- each displayed record may be sorted by various fields, such as the self-help system relating to the record, classifications, and the time associated with the record.
- each displayed record includes a hyperlink that allows CSR 160 to view the underlying data relating to the record (e.g., the particular web page viewed via web server 130 ; the particular forum topic that was viewed; or the email received by email server 150 , along with any related emails, such as automated replies).
- recommended solutions may be provided to CSR 160 based on the classifications.
- a recommended solution may provide, for example, a series of steps for CSR 160 to resolve the issue, including hyperlinks that direct a web browser used by CSR 160 to information or systems useful for resolving the issue.
- a set of prepared instructions for customer 110 may be automatically provided, and sent to customer 110 by CSR 160 via email or chat, for example.
- Web server classifier 135 is notified of a request of a web page associated with this section and obtains a classification labeled “Can't see my ads” for records stored in customer communication storage 170
- Web server classifier 135 is notified of requests for each of these pages and obtains a classification labeled “Can't see my ads” for records stored in customer communication storage 170
- CSR 160 fields the telephone communication, and uses customer service system 165 instantly sees that customer 110 had recent support inquiries with classifications labeled “Can't see my ads.” CSR quickly understands the customer's context and offers customer 110 alternatives besides those suggested by the in-product help and help center pages that customer 110 has already reviewed.
- CSR 160 By obtaining classifications associated with the use of the self-help systems by customer 110 in advance of customer 110 contacting CSR 160 , when customer 110 contacts CSR 160 , CSR 160 is more quickly able to ascertain a context for the contact by customer 110 . This allows CSR 160 to quickly understand and arrive at solutions for the issue customer 110 is attempting to resolve. The resulting improvement in time to reach a positive resolution of the issue increases the efficiency of the CSRs, and also enhances customer satisfaction. Also, the use of automated techniques for classifying customer communications provides a consistent, objective mechanism for classification that can be quickly executed, so as to immediately provide contextual information to CSRs when contacted by customers.
- Obtaining classifications for customer communications is described above as being performed, or being submitted to be performed, immediately in response to use of self-help systems, which helps ensure that when a customer 110 contacts CSR 160 , classifications for these communications are immediately available to ensure prompt assistance. However, in some embodiments obtaining classifications may be deferred until customer 110 actually seeks to communicate with CSR 160 . This has an advantage in that it substantially reduces the amount of classification processing performed by the classifiers. On the other hand, to ensure such classifications are quickly available for use by CSR 160 , the overall architecture must be configured to quickly perform “on the fly” classification of past communications once customer 110 contacts, or requests contact with, CSR 160 . Such deferred of classification may not be useful where records stored by customer communication storage 170 are used by other systems besides customer service system 165 , such as report generation systems which review records across all customers to identify support issues of current interest to customers.
- customer communication storage 170 may be put to other uses to enhance customer service. For example, by reviewing the records stored in customer communication storage 170 across all customers, and the amounts of records stored for various classifications, it may be possible to identify particular areas in which either a new problem may have arisen with the product, based on an unexpected increase in records stored for a particular classification, or it may be possible to identify areas in which improvements may be made to reduce customer service inquiries, based on classifications for which a significant number of records are consistently generated.
