Fig. 3 illustrates the flow chart of the exemplary method 300 for determining Business Stream availability.Method 300 includes receiving physics
Instruction (the step 302) of topology, logical topology and business demand.Method 300 also includes receiving cross-layer network model (step
304).With the loop iteration of predetermined number, method 300 includes generation fault sample (step 308), and in response to failure sample
Originally logical topology model (step 310) is updated.Then, updated logical topology model is determined using TE simulators whether
It disclosure satisfy that business demand (step 312).Method 300 carrys out the mean availability of calculating network including the use of DSMC
(step 316).As described herein, the availability of network or the availability of Business Stream refer to the network with the ability for realizing stream.
If for example, stream is available, network can between its desired source destination route flow.
As described above, method 300 includes receiving the data (step for representing physical topology, logical topology and business demand
302).As explained above with described in Fig. 2, data by network availability calculator 200 network modelling device 202 and failure maker
204 receive.Some data of such as business demand can be provided directly to TE simulators 206.In some embodiments, net

Availability calculations device 200 can also receive service level objective (SLO) set, and it includes specific products, application or contract and wanted
The measurement (for example, the bandwidth between two nodes is higher than the percentage of time of predetermined threshold) asked.
With reference to figure 3, method 300 includes：Receive the cross-layer network model (step that logical topology is mapped to physical topology
304).Logical topology is mapped to physical topology by cross-layer network model so that network availability calculator can be determined when in thing
During the basic cause to be broken down in reason topology, which logical links is affected.
The cross-layer figure of Fig. 4 graphicaccess networks 400.Network 400 includes being coupled to two destination nodes via routing node 404
406 (A) and 406 (B) source node 402.Within the physical layer, node connects via physical link 408.In logical layer, source section
Point 402 is logically coupled to destination node 406 (A) and destination node by logical links 410 (A) and 410 (B) respectively
406(B).Cross-layer network model instruction physical link 408 (A) and 408 (B) realize logical links 410 (A), and physical link
408 (A) and 408 (C) realize logical links 410 (B).
In some embodiments, it is due to open up to change the capacity of one or more links to determine the unavailable of given stream
Flutter constraint (for example, stream source and destination between different paths deficiency) or in the case where the capacity of link works not
Availability is due to congestion.In such embodiment, the capacity of link is increased to hypothesis by network availability calculator
Big value (for example, 100 times of the actual capacity of link) is to eliminate the influence of the link capacity of Interruption period between The following article.Large Copacity chain can be used
Method 300 is continued on road, and obtained availability value is represented in the upper of the dirty availability of topological constraints situation for only considering network
Limit.
Method 300 also includes generating fault sample (step 308) with the loop iteration of predetermined number.Fault sample includes
Random fault set in the physical link (or other network equipments) of physical topology.In some embodiments, the fault set
Close based on the fault rate for being supplied to network availability calculator.In other embodiments, it is raw by making basic L1 link failures
Into the random fault sample in L3 topologys.Simulation is realized due to need satisfaction caused by the failure in L1 topologys using cross-layer figure
Problem.For example, referring also to Fig. 4, the failure of physical link 408 (A) can cause in both logical links 410 (A) and 410 (B)
Capacity problem, and the failure in physical link 408 (B) will result only in the capacity problem in logical links 410 (A).
In some embodiments, it may be difficult to identify and thus the basic cause of the failure in network is modeled.
By the capacity probability distribution (for example, it is what that given link, which has the probability of specified vol) for collecting each logical links first
To generate fault sample, analyze indigestion or model the failure of the cause of downtime.Subtracted from capacity probability distribution
The failure of basic cause is known, to provide the remaining probability distribution of link capacity.In some embodiments, it is assumed that there is unknown
The failure of this cause only occurs in (or influence) logical links.Tool is analyzed by generating fault sample from residual error probability distribution
There is the failure of unidentified basic cause.In some embodiments, failure includes the mixing of unknown and known basic cause.
Referring still to Fig. 3, once generating fault sample, then carry out more new logic in response to the simulated failure in physical topology
Topological model (step 310).For example, referring also to Fig. 4, if physical link 408 (B) complete failure, the logic in model is opened up
Logical links 410 (A) will no longer be included by flutterring.Update the appearance that logical topology model also includes determining each link in logical network
Amount.In some embodiments, link capacity is illustrated as having the normal appearance of the value of variable-the first expression link of two values
Amount, and link capacity during second value expression link failure.In some embodiments, when logical link failure, logic chain
Road complete failure.In other embodiments, logic link part failure-for example, due to router line card failure or part
Reduce the capacity of link rather than cause other failures of complete link failure in ground.
In some embodiments, as illustrated in fig. 3, method 300 circulates pre-determined number, and each circulation is generated and tested new
Fault sample.Because network can include SRLG, the logic that the different faults in physical network can cause identical to update is opened up
Flutter model.Under these examples, network availability calculator can examine past circulation to determine under carry out method 300
Before one step, if calculate traffic engineered calculating to current logical topology model.If for example, network availability meter
Calculate device and determine that current failure sample causes the logical topology model analyzed in previous loops, then network availability calculator can be with
By fault sample be recorded as having generated with previous loops identical logical topology model, and the step of return to method 300
308 to generate new fault sample.As further discussed below, method described herein can also be performed in parallel in terms of reducing
Evaluation time.
Method 300 also includes：Determine whether updated local topology model can expire by traffic engineered simulator
Multiple business demand (the steps 312) of foot.The TE simulators of network availability calculator can by the logical topology model updated,
Link capacity X vector sum business demand set D receives as input.TE simulators return to f (X, D), and it is which business indicated
The vector function that demand is not satisfied also or part meets.For example, when providing link capacity with bi-level fashion, in meet demand
When f (X, D) be equal to 1, and when being unsatisfactory for demand f (X, D) be equal to 0.The dimension of output vector is equal to the demand number in D.
In some embodiments, traffic engineered simulator is additionally configured to calculate and track time delay.For example, for each
Logical topology, traffic engineered simulator calculates the set of paths that route each flows, and also calculates the wide area network in each path
(WAN) time delay (for example, propagation delay).The delay statistics of calculating are combined across topological sample, to have generated in a fault situation
Whole time delay distribution.By time delay distribution compared with the time delay hundredths target defined in service level objective, to determine that stream is
It is no to meet its time delay target.
Next, method 300 comprises determining whether to perform the circulation (step 314) of predetermined number.If perform predetermined
The circulation of number, then method 300 can terminate.In some embodiments, then, network availability calculator uses Meng Teka
Lip river method calculates vector function f (X, D) desired value (assembly average) (step 316).Network availability calculator will be pre-
Time value is reported as the availability flowed in logical network.In some embodiments, the availability of stream is patrolled compared with SLO with determination
Collect whether topological model meets SLO.If having not carried out the circulation of predetermined number, method 300 includes generating new failure sample
This.
When performing the above method 300, the precision of the input data received in step 302 influences the precision that output calculates.
In some embodiments, it is difficult to collect accurate probability of malfunction, because constantly updating, replacing and improving group of networks
Part.Relation between component faults probability data and stream availability is nonlinearity, and does not have closed form.In some implementations
In mode, the sensitivity of probability of malfunction is analyzed using finite difference calculus.Finite difference calculus is included first with primary fault probability
Data carry out operation method 300, and then, in response to somewhat changing probability of malfunction data (for example, somewhat increaseing or decreasing failure
Probability) and operation method 300 again.Then it is calculated to standardize two with the change made to primary fault probability data
Between difference, with create modification probability of malfunction data, so as to provide the finger of the susceptibility of change of the result to component faults probability
Show.
In some embodiments, by performing method 300 come result of calculation to component with the probability of malfunction data of modification
The susceptibility of the change of probability of malfunction, the probability of malfunction data directly basis of modification are observed during the simulation of physical fault data
To stream availability sample estimate.Method 300 is performed with physical fault data to make it possible to run single simulation, rather than not
Same simulation, wherein, the fault data of modification only one networking component in each simulation.

Chain includes representing two states (0 and 1) of complete failure and full-scale operation.In other embodiments, time Markov chain
The state of M number can be included to represent the state between complete failure and full-scale operation.Transformation between state can by from
The failure and repair rate of historical data estimation carry out management and control.
If logical topology includes N number of logical links, each logical links has M state, then the number Y of possible state
It is MN, and the differential equation of the change of the distribution of management and control Link State is：
Wherein Q is MN×MNRatio transition matrix, wherein for each possible network state there is a line one to arrange.
In some embodiments, it is assumed that each logical links is independent, and while on more than one L1 link
The probability of state change is zero.In these embodiments, each state has the N number of adjacent shapes of (M-1) * that can be converted to
State.
In some embodiments, mould is mapped by using holding and jump procedure (hold-and-jump process)
Type, simulated time dimensional model.In this process, the time quantum that network is maintained at the particular state is with equal to adjacent states
The ratio index distribution of all number turnover sums.In simultaneously jump procedure is kept, the probability that state j is jumped to from state i is determined
Justice is：
If j ≠ i, Rij=Qij-Qii
Otherwise Rij=0
In some embodiments, method described herein be used to estimating the expection of a part of need satisfaction each flowed
Availability.The usability area of stream can meet to 100% from 0%, and infrastructure service is treated differently from different availabilities
It is horizontal.For example, if infrastructure service detects the stream availability of satisfaction 90%, the service can reduce its transmission rate to increase
Flow availability.By estimating the expection availability for being used for portion requirements and meeting, it can plan and analysis meets a series of bandwidth need
The network asked.For example, can be with planning network to meet to require the relatively low service level objective of 100% stream availability or meet small
