Technical Field
Embodiments of the present invention relate to the field of video conferencing, and more particularly, to aggregating lists of current, context, and/or member-dependent video conferences.
Background
Video conferencing is used to provide multiple participants at different locations with the ability to communicate with each other. In particular, video conferencing systems often utilize personal computers with webcams to capture and transmit audio/video content to other users via the internet. Organizers of such video conferences typically select participants of the video conference and invite them to the video conference by, for example, sending them a link associated with the video conference or a notification that they have been invited to join the video conference. Accordingly, users are typically unaware of currently available video conferences and must wait for an invitation or notification in order to join the video conference.

Detailed Description
A video conferencing system and method for aggregating lists of video conferences for users is described. A video conferencing system maintains a plurality of video conferences (also referred to herein as video chats or video conference rooms or video chat rooms) created by different users at various points in time. Video conference rooms may have different participants and may be related to different contexts. The context of a video conference may, for example, relate to subject matter or content discussed or posted prior to or during the video conference.
In one embodiment, a video conference system identifies currently available video conferences (e.g., active or live video chats open for participation by a user), selects video conferences relevant to the user context and/or members, and presents a list of the selected video conferences to the user. The list of selected video conferences may be presented while the user is viewing (or listening to) content (e.g., video clips, news articles, audio recordings, etc.) provided by the website. Contextually relevant video conferences may include video conferences having topics that may be of interest to the user. For example, subject matter that is likely to be of interest to a user may be identified based on content items currently or previously presented to the user, content items recommended to the user, search requests submitted by the user, the user's web browsing history, the user's profile, video conferences initiated, created, or attended by the user, and so forth, as permitted by the user. For example, if a user is searching for a particular movie, the list presented to the user may include available video conferences that have this movie as the topic or have content related to this movie (e.g., video conferences in which participants discuss the movie or post video clips from the movie).
Member-specific video conferences may include video conferences with participants having a relationship with the user. For example, the participants having a relationship with the user may include friends of the user, participants having a history of engaging with the user (e.g., as colleagues, clients, or business partners), participants providing content subscribed by the user, participants having a content browsing history similar to the user, participants having a similar affiliation to the user, and so forth, as permitted by the user and the participants. For example, the list presented to the user may include video conferences hosted by friends of the user or video conferences hosted by people who provide content to which the user subscribes (e.g., people to whom the user has subscribed to be notified or receive their website posts, social media posts, or video conferences).
The list of video conferences presented to the user may be updated in real-time as related video conferences are created or become no longer available and/or as their participants or context are modified. The user may select a video conference from the list and join the selected video conference without waiting for an invitation from any participant of the selected video conference.
The embodiment of the invention improves the user experience of the video conference. Users can now easily find video conferences with participants with whom the user may enjoy interacting and/or video conferences about topics in which the user may be interested.
Fig. 1 illustrates an exemplary network architecture 100 according to one embodiment of the invention. The network architecture 100 may include a server 104 and a plurality of user devices 108 coupled to the server 104 via a network 102 (e.g., a public network such as the internet, or a private network such as a Local Area Network (LAN) or another network, e.g., a mobile communications network).
The server 104 hosts a video conference system 106 that maintains a number of live and/or pre-scheduled video conferences created by various users of user devices 108. Video conferencing may be enabled using, for example, streaming video or voice over IP (VoIP) technology, and may be used for personal, entertainment, business, or educational or academic interactions. The server 104 may be dedicated to providing video conferencing services or may provide video conferencing services in conjunction with services including, for example, news services, social networking services, and/or content hosting services. For example, the server 104 may allow a user to view a video clip or a news article and begin a video conference while viewing the video clip or the news article. In another example, the server 104 may allow a user to start a video conference while visiting a social networking site or video content hosting site.
The video conference maintained by video conference system 106 may vary based on time, context, and participants, and may include live video conferences (currently occurring) and pre-scheduled video conferences. A live video conference may include an active video conference with at least one active participant or an inactive video conference that no longer has any active participants (e.g., if all participants have left the video conference). A user can join a video conference upon receiving an invitation (e.g., a link) from a host or a participant of the video conference. In addition, videoconferencing system 106 can aggregate a list of live and/or pre-scheduled videoconferences for the user, present the aggregated list to the user, and allow the user to join a videoconference selected from the list. The list may be aggregated based on one or more criteria. As will be discussed in more detail below, the criteria may include a status of the video conference (e.g., whether the video conference is active or inactive), a contextual relevance of the video conference, and a member relevance of the video conference. In one embodiment, the list includes only public video conferences (e.g., video conferences marked as public or not marked as private or restricted access).
The list of video conferences may be presented to the user when the user logs into the video conference service or when the user views (or listens to) content on a web page provided by another service (content hosting service, news service, social networking service, etc.). In embodiments where a user is presented with a list of video conferences when viewing (or listening to) content on a web page provided by another service (e.g., a content hosting service, a news service, a social networking service, etc.), the list of video conferences may be received by the other service from the video conference service and presented to users who are then able to join a video conference selected from the list.
The list may be periodically updated to reflect recent changes in available video conferences. In one embodiment, the list includes only video conferences that may be of interest to the user. Alternatively, the list may include all available video conferences, and those video conferences that may be of interest to the user may be identified (e.g., by underlining, highlighting, ranking, page display arrangement, etc.).
Although network architecture 100 is illustrated as a client server environment, the functionality discussed herein may be implemented in a peer-to-peer environment (e.g., video conference system 106 residing on one or more nodes), a cloud computing environment (e.g., video conference system 106 residing within a computing cloud), a grid computing environment (e.g., video conference system 106 residing within a distributed computing system), and so forth.
Fig. 2 is a block diagram of one embodiment of a video conferencing system 200. Video conferencing system 200 may be the same as video conferencing system 106 of fig. 1 and may include an active video conference identifier 202, a relevant user identifier 204, a relevant context identifier 206, a video conference list presenter 210, and a user information repository 208. According to various embodiments, the components of video conferencing system 200 may represent modules that may be combined together or separated into other modules.
Video conference list renderer 210 aggregates lists of video conferences for particular users based on various criteria and renders the lists to the respective users. The criteria may be the same for all users or may vary for different users based on user preferences specified in the user profile. The video conference list renderer 210 may initiate the aggregation process upon detecting a user's online activity on a website associated with the video conference system 200 (e.g., receiving an indication that a search query has been submitted in a content hosting website, receiving an indication that a body update associated with a particular topic (e.g., currently playing a football game) is received on a social networking website, receiving an indication that a user is reading an article on a news website, etc.) or when a user logs into the video conference system 200.
Depending on the criteria used to select a video conference for the user, video conference list renderer 210 may invoke active video conference identifier 202, relevant user identifier 204, and/or relevant context identifier 206, either continuously or in parallel, to identify video conferences that are likely to be of interest to the user. The active video conference identifier 202 may identify all live video conferences and select a video conference having at least one active participant. The relevant context identifier 206 identifies a video conference having a relevant context. The associated user identifier 204 identifies the video conference with the participant associated with the user.
The relevant context identifier 206 identifies a video conference having a relevant context. In one embodiment, the relevant context identifier 206 identifies video conferences with relevant context by determining topics that may be of interest to the user, identifying the context of available video conferences (e.g., active, live, and/or pre-scheduled video conferences), and selecting video conferences with context relevant to any topic that may be of interest to the user. For example, subject matter that may be of interest to a user may be determined based on content items currently or previously presented to the user, content items recommended to the user, search requests submitted by the user, the user's web browsing history, the user's profile, video conferences initiated, created, or attended by the user, and so forth, as permitted by the user. The relevant context identifier 206 may request this information from various services as permitted by the user, store the information or metadata about the information in the user information store 208 and periodically update the information or metadata to reflect recent changes. The context of a video conference may be identified based on the name of the video conference, the subject matter of the video conference, the content discussed or posted during the video conference, the audio or visual background data used for the video conference, the web page or service used to create the video conference (e.g., whether the page or service is related to a content hosting site or a social networking site), the web page or service used by participants to view the video conference, etc., as permitted by the moderator and/or participants of the video conference.
The associated user identifier 204 identifies the video conference with the participant associated with the user. In one embodiment, the relevant user identifier 204 identifies a video conference having participants related to the user by identifying participants of an available video conference or video conference having relevant context, selecting those participants related to the user, and discovering the video conference having relevant participants. For example, the participants related to the user may include friends of the user, participants having a history of engaging with the user (e.g., as colleagues, clients, or business partners), participants providing content subscribed by the user, participants having a content browsing history similar to the user, participants having a similar affiliation with the user, participants for whom the user has requested to follow a video conference or website post, etc., as permitted by the user and the participants. The relevant user identifier 204 requests this information from the various services as permitted by the user and stores it in the user information store 208 and periodically updates it to reflect the most recent changes. The user information repository 208 may represent a single data structure or multiple data structures (tables, databases, repositories, files, etc.) resident on one or more mass storage devices, such as magnetic or optical storage-based disks, solid state drives, or hard drives. In an exemplary embodiment, the video conferencing system 200 notifies users of the types of information stored in the user information repository 208 and provides the users with an opportunity to opt out of having such information collected and/or shared with the video conferencing system 200.
Video conference list presenter 210 may update a list of video conferences presented to a user in real-time as related video conferences are created or become no longer available and/or as their participants or context are modified. The list may include only video conferences that may be of interest to the user. Alternatively, the list may include all available video conferences, and those video conferences that may be of interest to the user may be identified (e.g., by underlining, highlighting, ranking, page display arrangement, etc.).
Fig. 3 and 4 are flow diagrams of various embodiments of methods for generating a list for a user's video conference. The method is performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both. In one embodiment, the methods of fig. 3 and 4 are performed by video conferencing system 200 of fig. 2, or a component thereof.
Fig. 3 is a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method 300 for aggregating lists of contextually relevant video conferences. At block 302, the video conferencing system identifies one or more topics of interest to the user. At block 306, the video conference system identifies active, live, and/or pre-scheduled video conferences. At block 308, the video conference system identifies the context of each active, live, and/or pre-scheduled video conference. At block 310, the video conference system selects an active, live, and/or pre-scheduled video conference having context related to one or more topics of interest to the user. At block 314, the video conference system suggestion includes a list of selected video conferences. In one embodiment, the video conferencing system presents the above list on a web page that is currently being viewed by the user. The web page may include a first portion for presenting content (e.g., a video clip, an audio recording, or a news article) and a second portion for presenting a list of video conferences to the user. An exemplary user interface illustrating the presentation of content and the presentation of a list of video conferences will be discussed in more detail below in conjunction with fig. 5A.
Fig. 4 is a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method 400 for aggregating a list of member-dependent video conferences. At block 402, the video conference system identifies participants (also referred to herein as members) of an active, live, and/or pre-scheduled video conference. At block 404, the video conference system selects those participants that are relevant to the user. At block 406, the video conference system compiles a list of video conferences with relevant participants. At block 408, the video conference system suggests the compiled list. In one embodiment, the video conferencing system presents the above list on a web page that is currently being viewed by the user. The web page may include a first portion for presenting content (e.g., a video clip, an audio recording, or a news article) and a second portion for presenting a list of video conferences to the user. An exemplary user interface illustrating the presentation of content and the presentation of a list of video conferences will be discussed in more detail below in conjunction with fig. 5B.
It should be noted that the operations of method 300 or method 400 may be performed in a different order than shown in fig. 3 or 4. For example, with respect to fig. 3, the video conference system may first perform the operations of blocks 306 and 308 to maintain a list of video conferences associated with a related context or topic and then present this list to the user (e.g., with tags representing the context or topic). The user may indicate a context or topic of interest (e.g., by selecting one of the tags), and the video conference system may identify this context or topic of interest (block 302) and then perform the operations of blocks 310 and 314 to suggest relevant video conferences to the user.
Fig. 5A illustrates an exemplary Graphical User Interface (GUI)500 presenting a list of contextually relevant video conferences, according to some embodiments of the invention. GUI 500 may be provided by a network or video hosting service and includes a portion 502 for playing videos and a portion 506 for presenting a list of contextually relevant video conferences (referred to as video chats in fig. 5). Portion 506 also includes a GUI element 508 in the form of a button to allow the user to start a new video conference.
In the illustrated embodiment, the video conferences included in list 506 have context (e.g., topics or content) related to the video played in portion 502 of GUI 500. The user may select a video conference from the list 506 by, for example, hovering over a list item with a mouse control mechanism or highlighting it with a keyboard, and join the video conference using a designated GUI element (e.g., a link or another element not shown).
In the example shown in fig. 5A, the video played in section 502 shows a football game between brazil and ecuador, and the user is able to see a list of public live video conferences relevant to this football game. As shown, the user may choose to see a list of video conferences involving only brazilian fans or a list of video conferences involving only ecuador fans. The user may also log into the video conference service using link 504 to see a list of contextually relevant video conferences with participants related to the user.
Fig. 5B illustrates an exemplary GUI 520 presenting a list of contextually and member-wise relevant video conferences, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. GUI 520 may be provided by a network or video hosting service and includes a portion 522 for playing a video and a portion 524 for presenting a list 528 of contextually and member-wise related video conferences. Portion 524 also includes a GUI element 526 in the form of a button to allow the user to start a new video conference.
In the illustrated embodiment, the video conferences included in list 528 have context (e.g., topic or content) related to the video being played and relate to participants who are friends with the user. The user may select a video conference from the list 528 by, for example, hovering over the respective list item with a mouse control or highlighting it with a keyboard, and join the video conference using a designated GUI element (e.g., button 530 or another GUI element not shown).
Fig. 6 illustrates a diagrammatic representation of a machine in the exemplary form of a computer system 600 within which a set of instructions, for causing the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein, may be executed. In alternative embodiments, the machine may be connected (e.g., networked) to other machines in a LAN, an intranet, an extranet, or the internet. The machine may operate in the capacity of a server or a client machine in a client-server network environment, or as a peer machine in a peer-to-peer (or distributed) network environment. The machine may be a Personal Computer (PC), a tablet PC, a set-top box (STB), a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a mobile telephone, a web appliance, a server, a network router, switch or bridge, or any machine capable of executing a set of instructions (sequential or otherwise) that specify actions to be taken by that machine. Further, while only a single machine is illustrated, the term "machine" shall also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or jointly execute a set (or multiple sets) of instructions to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein.
The exemplary computer system 600 includes a processing device (processor) 602, a main memory 604 (e.g., Read Only Memory (ROM), flash memory, Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), such as synchronous DRAM (sdram) or Rambus DRAM (RDRAM), etc.), a static memory 606 (e.g., flash memory, Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), etc.), and a data storage device 616, which communicate with each other via a bus 608.
The computer system 600 may also include a network interface device 622. Computer system 600 may also include a video display unit 610 (e.g., a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) or a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)), an alphanumeric input device 612 (e.g., a keyboard), a cursor control device 614 (e.g., a mouse), and a signal generation device 620 (e.g., a speaker).
While the computer-readable storage medium 624 is shown in an exemplary embodiment to be a single medium, the term "computer-readable storage medium" should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, and/or associated caches and servers) that store the one or more sets of instructions. The term "computer-readable storage medium" shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying a set of instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present invention. The term "computer-readable storage medium" shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, solid-state memories, optical media, and magnetic media.
In the foregoing description, numerous details are set forth. However, it will be apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art having had the benefit of the present disclosure that the present invention may be practiced without the specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid obscuring the present invention.
Some portions of the detailed descriptions have been presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.
It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussions, it is appreciated that throughout the present description, discussions utilizing terms such as "identifying," "providing," "enabling," "discovering," "selecting," or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (e.g., electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.
The present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), Random Access Memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions.
The word "example" or "exemplary" is used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. Any aspect or design described herein as "exemplary" or "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs. Rather, use of the word "example" or "exemplary" is intended to present concepts in a concrete fashion. The term "or" as used herein is intended to mean an inclusive "or" rather than an exclusive "or". That is, unless otherwise specified or apparent from context, "X comprises a or B" is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, if X comprises A; x comprises B; or X includes both A and B, then "X includes A or B" is satisfied under any of the foregoing circumstances. In addition, the articles "a" and "an" as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean "one or more" unless specified otherwise or clear from context to be directed to a singular form. Furthermore, the use of the terms "an embodiment" or "one embodiment" or "an implementation" or "one implementation" are not intended to mean the same embodiment or implementation throughout, unless described as such.
It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive. Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading and understanding the above description. The scope of the invention should, therefore, be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.
