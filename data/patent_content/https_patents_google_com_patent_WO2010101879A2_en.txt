Definitions
- This document relates to content submission.
- content items of particular interest to a user can be identified by a search engine in response to a user query.
- the query can include one or more search terms, and the search engine can identify and, optionally, rank the content items based on the search terms in the query and present the content items to the user (e.g., according to the rank).
- This query can also be an indicator of the type of information of interest to the user.
- advertisement syndication Another form of online advertising is advertisement syndication, which allows advertisers to extend their marketing reach by distributing advertisements to additional partners.
- third party online publishers can place an advertiser's text or image advertisements on web pages that have content related to the advertisement. As the users are likely interested in the particular content on the publisher webpage, they are also likely to be interested in the product or service featured in the advertisement. Accordingly, such targeted advertisement placement can help drive online customers to the advertiser's website.
- some advertisers still lack the ability to submit advertisements to publishers based upon a lack of Internet access, a lack of comfort with the advertisement submission process, etc. Such advertisers would benefit from additional mechanisms for submitting advertisements that go beyond traditional advertisement submission mechanisms.
- the subject matter of this application relates to providing a messaging interface operable to receive advertisements submissions.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a method for receiving advertisement submissions.
- the method can include the actions of: receiving one or more messages in a messaging format from a device associated with an advertiser, the one or more messages including advertising information and target audience information; generating an advertisement based upon the message; and providing the advertisement for targeted distribution based upon the target audience information.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding methods, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Various optional advantages and features can include increasing the ability of business owners to participate in online advertising. Another optional advantage can include providing targeted advertising based upon an expected audience associated with many online publishers and/or search queries. Other optional advantages can include an instruction menu provided in a messaging format and a prepay billing plan. These various optional advantages and features can be separately realized and need not present in any particular embodiment.

- the subject matter of this specification can be implemented in an online environment, such as the example online environment 100 shown in Fig. 1.
- the online environment 100 can facilitate the identification and serving of content items, e.g., web pages, advertisements, etc., to users.
- a computer network 110 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects online advertisers 102a and 102b, an advertisement management system 104, publishers 106a and 106b, user devices 108a and 108b, and a search engine 112.
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the Internet or a combination thereof
- search engine 112 a search engine
- a messaging network 140 (such as, e.g., an SMS capable network, an EMS capable network, an MMS capable network, etc.) can connect mobile users 145 who wish to provide online advertisements through using their mobile phone to the advertisement management system 104 using a messaging interface for advertisement submission 150.
- a messaging network 140 can connect mobile users 145 who wish to provide online advertisements through using their mobile phone to the advertisement management system 104 using a messaging interface for advertisement submission 150.
- the online environment 100 may include many thousands of mobile users using the messaging interface for advertisement submission 150.
- one or more advertisers 102a, 102b and/or 145 can directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track advertisement information in the advertising management system 104.
- the advertisements can be in the form of graphical advertisements, such as banner advertisements, text only advertisements, image advertisements, audio advertisements, video advertisements, advertisements combining one of more of any of such components, etc., or any other type of electronic advertisement.
- the advertisements may also include embedded information, such as a links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions, such as HTML or JavaScriptTM.
- a user device such as user device 108a, can submit a page content request 109 to a publisher or the search engine 112.
- the page content 111 can be provided to the user device 108a in response to the request 109.
- the page content can include advertisements provided by the advertisement management system 104, or can include executable instructions, e.g., JavaScriptTM, that can be executed at the user device 108a to request advertisements from the advertisement management system 104.
- Example user devices 108 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, television set-top boxes, etc.
- Advertisements can also be provided from the publishers 106. For example, one or more publishers 106a and/or 106b can submit advertisement requests for one or more advertisements to the system 104.
- the system 104 responds by sending the advertisements to the requesting publisher 106a or 106b for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content).
- the advertisements can include embedding links landing pages, e.g., pages on the advertisers 102 websites, that a user is directed to when the user clicks an ad presented on a publisher website.
- the advertisement requests can also include content request information.
- This information can include the content itself (e.g., page or other content document), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, etc.
- content e.g., page or other content document
- category corresponding to the content or the content request e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.
- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.
- geo-location information e.g., geo-location information, etc.
- a publisher 106 can combine the requested content with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 104. This combined page content 109 and advertisements can be sent to the user device 108 that requested the content (e.g., user device 108a) as page content 111 for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system). The publisher 106 can transmit information about the advertisements back to the advertisement management system 104, including information describing how, when, and/or where the advertisements are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScriptTM).
- Publishers 106a and 106b can include general content servers that receive requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, etc.), and retrieves the requested content in response to the request.
- content servers related news content providers, retailers, independent blogs, social network sites, or any other entity that provides content over the network 110 can be a publisher.
- Advertisements can also be provided through the use of the search engine 112.
- the search engine 112 can receive queries for search results. In response, the search engine 112 can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages).
- An exemplary search engine 112 is described in the article S. Brin and L. Page, "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine," Seventh International World Wide Web Conference, Brisbane, Australia and in U.S. Patent No. 6,285,999.
- Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search engine 112 can also submit a request for advertisements to the system 104.
- the request may include a number of advertisements desired. This number may depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the advertisements, etc.
- the request for advertisements may also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo- location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- the search engine 112 can combine the search results with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 104. This combined information can then be forwarded to the user device 108 that requested the content as the page content 111.
- the search results can be maintained as distinct from the advertisements, so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and presumably neutral search results.
- the advertisers 102, user devices 108, and/or the search engine 112 can also provide usage information to the advertisement management system 104. This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to advertisements that have been served, such as, for example, whether or not a conversion or a selection related to an advertisement has occurred.
- the system 104 performs financial transactions, such as crediting the publishers 106 and charging the advertisers 102 based on the usage information. Such usage information can also be processed to measure performance metrics, such as a click-through rate ("CTR”), conversion rate, and other measurable performance metrics.
- CTR click-through rate
- a click-through can occur, for example, when a user of a user device, selects or "clicks" on a link to a content item returned by the publisher or the advertising management system.
- the CTR is a performance metric that is obtained by dividing the number of users that clicked on the content item, e.g., a link to a landing page, an advertisement, or a search result, by the number of times the content item was delivered. For example, if a link to a content item is delivered 100 times, and three persons click on the content item, then the CTR for that content item is 3%.
- Other usage information and/or performance metrics e.g., cost per mille (CPM) can also be used.
- a "conversion" occurs when a user consummates a transaction related to a previously served advertisement. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on an advertisement, is referred to the advertiser's web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page.
- a conversion can also be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a Website, viewing at least a certain number of Web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a Website or Web page, registering on a Website, etc. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- Advertisements can be submitted to the advertising management system 104 in a variety of ways.
- the advertising management system 104 can facilitate submission of advertisements through a messaging interface 150.
- the messaging interface 150 can receive messages (e.g., SMS messages, EMS messages, MMS messages, etc.) from advertisers 145 that would like to advertise through the advertising management system 104. Such messages can be transmitted through a messaging network 140 to the advertising management system 104.
- the messaging interface 150 can provide instructions for submitting advertisements to the advertising managements system 104 using the messaging interface. Such instructions, for example, can be provided using an online interface such as, for example, a web-based interface. In other examples, the instructions can be provided within one or more messages sent to the advertiser 145. In those examples using messaging to distribute instructions to advertisers 145, the messaging interface 150 can include an automated interactive messaging response system whereby users can send a message to the messaging interface 150 and receive a response from the messaging interface 150 based upon the content of the message.
- an initial message to the messaging interface 150 might elicit a response message providing a menu for accessing various categories of instructions, the menu instructing the user to send a reply message with the text "1" to access instructions on the general message format to use when submitting a message, a reply message with the text "2" to receive instructions on billing, a reply message with the text "3" to receive instruction on retrieving performance statistics, etc.
- Other menu structures and/or hierarchies can be used.
- the messaging interface 150 can include a parsing component operable to parse messages received from advertisers 145 based upon the format specified by the instructions.
- the instructions might indicate separating fields for different advertisement components by a slash character (T) or some other delimiter.
- the fields can include, for example, an advertisement creative field (e.g., including a header/title field and a body field) as input for generating a creative, a bidding information field identifying bidding information for participation of the advertisement in auctions, and billing information from which an advertiser's account can be debited when some action is detected with respect to the advertisement (e.g., when the advertisement is served to a user, when the advertisement is selected by a user, when a conversion occurs as a result of the advertisement, etc.).
- an advertiser might want to submit an advertisement for a bicycle.
- the advertiser in this example can send a text message to the messaging interface 150 including the content: Bicycle for sale!
- the first field can be a title field, and in this example would be "Bicycle for sale!
- the second field can be a creative field, and in this example would be "Folding Citizen Bike, sparingly used - Free dropoff in the Bay area.”
- the third field can include the keywords to be used for the advertisement, and in this example would be "bicycle,” "bike,” “folding bike” and "Citizen bike.”
- the text message can also include billing information for the advertiser using any of the delimiters identified above.
- the parser can determine whether any portion of the advertisement, bidding or billing information is missing and can send a text message to the advertiser requesting any of the missing information.
- the messaging interface 150 can elicit successive messages that include different elements of information describing the advertisement to be created. Following each message sent by the advertiser, the messaging interface can provide Instructions identifying what the contents of the next message sent by the advertiser 145 to the messaging interface 150 should include. For example, the messaging interface 150 can receive a first message that contains the advertisement. In this example, the messaging interface 150 can respond to the receipt of the advertisement with a request for bidding information. The advertiser 145 can then reply to the request for bidding information with the bids he/she wants to enter for the advertisement placement.
- the messaging interface 150 can send a message to the advertiser 145 requesting billing information.
- the messaging interface 150 can generate an advertisement from the initial message, and once the billing information is received, the advertisement along with associated bidding information can be released to the advertisement data store 114 for distribution using the advertising management system 104.
- a lead capture instruction can be included with the advertisement in the advertising management system 104.
- the lead capture instruction can provide an action to be taken as a result of the user selecting the advertisement.
- the lead capture instruction can instruct a browser to retrieve a landing page upon selection of the advertisement. Because the advertiser has submitted the advertisement through a messaging interface 150, the messaging interface 150 can automatically generate a landing page for the advertisement.
- a landing page for the advertisement when the user selects the advertisement, he/she will be directed to the landing page.
- the landing page can provide additional information (e.g., address, coupons, etc.) for the advertiser. Such additional information can be collected, for example, based upon listings, messages received from the advertiser, etc.).
- selection of the advertisement can cause a call to be placed in those instances where the user selects the device using a mobile communications device (e.g., cellular phone) or a computer with internet telephony.
- selection of the advertisement can cause a text message to be sent to the advertiser with contact information supplied by the user.
- the advertisement can direct the user to call a number associated with the advertisement management system 104. When a call is received, the advertisement management system 104 can record a selection of the advertisement and forward the call to the advertiser.
- a billing component included in the messaging interface 150 can track the advertisement to determine whether an advertisement account associated with the advertisement should be debited (e.g., based upon the billing paradigm (e.g., cost per click (CPC), cost per impression (CPI), etc.) associated with the advertisement).
- the billing component can charge a third party account (e.g., bank account, credit card, mobile phone, etc.) to open an advertisement account for the advertiser 145 with the advertising management system 104. Thereby, charges from advertisement placements can be debited from the advertisement account.
- the charge can be made to the third party account each time an action is taken with regard to the advertisement.
- the advertiser 145 can specify a maximum amount to be spent on the campaign.
- the maximum amount to be spent on the campaign can be managed by the amount of money placed into the advertisement account.
- the advertisement is not served again until the advertiser 145 places more money into the advertisement account.
- the user can specify a maximum amount to be debited from the third party account.
- the advertiser 145 can provide additional approval to raise the budget for the campaign.
- the messaging interface can provide performance metrics to the advertiser 145 using a messaging format (e.g., SMS, EMS, MMS, etc.).
- the performance metrics can include a number of times the advertisement has been served, a number of selections of the advertisement, a cost per impression, an average price paid for advertisement placements, most popular search terms for users that viewed and/or selected the advertisement, etc.
- the performance metrics can be used by the advertiser 145 to judge the effectiveness of the campaign.
- Fig. 2 is a block diagram of an example messaging interface for advertisement submission 150.
- the messaging interface for advertisement submission 150 can facilitate the submission of advertisements for use in online targeted advertising using messaging formats (e.g., SMS, EMS, MMS, etc.).
- the messaging interface 150 can include an instruction component 210, an advertisement generation component 220, a payment component 230, and a campaign reporting component 240.
- the instruction component 210 can be operable to provide instructions for formatting of submissions to the messaging interface 150.
- the instructions can provide a text messaging template to which the advertiser can reply and fill the relevant information into the correct fields of the template.
- the instructions can provide an interactive message interface whereby the user can request instructions for specific parts of the submission.
- the instruction component 210 can provide successive instructions to the advertiser 145 based upon successful submission of successive components of an advertisement. For example, the advertiser 145 can submit a title. The instruction component 210 can then provide instructions for submission of body text for the creative. Upon receiving body text for the creative, the instruction component can provide instructions for submission of target information, bidding information, billing information, etc.
- the advertisement generation component 220 can be operable to generate an advertisement based upon one or more submissions received from the advertiser 145. Based upon the information received in one or more messages from the advertiser 145 the advertisement generation component 220 can generate an advertisement, including, e.g., one or more of an advertisement creative, a linked page, target audience, bidding information, and/or billing information.
- the advertisement generation component 220 can parse the message to separate the component parts of the advertisement (e.g., header/title, body text, link, target information, bidding information, billing information, etc.). In such implementations, the advertisement generation component 220 can inspect the message to ensure that an advertisement can be accurately created from the message. If the advertisement generation component 220 is unable to generate the advertisement from the message, the advertisement generation component 220 can direct the instructions component 210 to request the advertiser resubmit the advertisement. Alternatively, the advertisement generation component 220 can direct the instructions component to send a request to the advertiser to submit only that portion of the advertisement which was not derived from one or more earlier messages.
- the advertisement generation component 220 can parse the message to separate the component parts of the advertisement (e.g., header/title, body text, link, target information, bidding information, billing information, etc.). In such implementations, the advertisement generation component 220 can inspect the message to ensure that an advertisement can be accurately created from the message. If the advertisement generation component 220 is unable to generate the advertisement
- the advertisement generation component 220 can identify the components of the advertisement based upon the different messages received from the advertiser 145. In such implementations, the advertisement generation component 220 can inspect each of the messages to ensure that a current message is in proper format. For example, the advertisement generation component can direct the instructions component 210 to provide instructions for submitting a next advertisement component of the advertisement if the current message is in the proper format or to provide instructions for resubmitting a current advertisement component if the current message is in an improper or unrecognized format.
- the payment component 230 can be operable to debit a user account responsive to a performance metric associated with the advertisement.
- the payment component 230 can debit an advertiser account when the advertisement is selected by a user.
- a bidding system can be used to select advertisements for display to a user.
- the payment component 230 can debit the advertiser's account based upon auction results associated with the presentation of the advertisement.
- the advertiser account can be a third party account, or the advertiser account can be account with the advertising management system.
- the payment component can store an advertising budget for the advertisement as provided by the advertiser.
- the payment component for example, can remove the advertisement from eligibility for targeted distribution to users based upon the budget.
- the budget for example, can be specified by the advertiser based upon the size of the advertiser's account, or can be based upon an amount provided by the advertiser 145 during submission of the advertisement.
- the campaign reporting component 240 can provide statistical metrics to the advertiser 145 regarding his/her advertising campaign.
- the statistical metrics can include, for example, the number of times an advertisement has been served, a number of times the advertisement has been selected, conversions resulting from the advertisement display, length of campaign, average cost per impression, average cost per click, etc.
- the performance metrics can be provided to the advertiser 145 using a messaging protocol.
- Fig. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process 300 for adjusting participation probability for a content item in a content item selection process.
- one or more messages are received.
- the one or more messages can be received, for example, by a messaging interface (e.g., messaging interface 150 of FIG. 2) in conjunction with an advertisement generation component (e.g., advertisement generation component 220 of FIG. 2).
- the entire advertisement is received in a single message, while in other implementations, the advertisement is received over multiple messages.
- the one or more message can include both advertisement information (e.g., a creative) and target audience information (e.g., targeted search terms, demographic information, etc.)
- an advertisement is generated based upon the one or more messages.
- the advertisement can be generated, for example, by a messaging interface (e.g., messaging interface 150 of FIG. 2) in conjunction with an advertisement generation component (e.g., advertisement generation component 220 of FIG. 2).
- An advertisement in a single message can include delimiters operable to separate the various fields that can be requested by the messaging interface (e.g., including title/header, advertisement body, link, target audience, bidding information, billing information, etc.) Advertisements received in multiple messages can be parsed according to the order in which the messages were received.
- instructions can be provided to the advertiser to alert the advertiser as to how to format the advertisement submission.
- the advertisement can be a targeted text advertisement, a targeted graphical advertisement, a targeted video advertisement, a targeted audio advertisement, etc.
- the advertisement is provided for targeted distribution.
- the advertisement can be provided for targeted distribution, for example, by an advertising management system (e.g., advertising management system 104 of FIG. 1 ).
- the advertisement can be served with search results when search terms related to the advertisement are submitted to a search engine.
- the advertisement can be served based upon a request from a web publisher for advertisements to be included within his/her web page.
- Fig. 4 is a flow diagram of another example process 400 for adjusting participation probability for a content item in a content item selection process.
- instructions for advertisement submission are sent to an advertiser.
- the instructions can be sent, for example, by a messaging interface (e.g., messaging interface 150 of FIG. 2) in conjunction with an instruction component (e.g., instruction component 210 of FIG. 2).
- the instruction component can instruct the advertiser to submit the various components of an advertisement in several different messages.
- the instruction component can instruct the advertiser to submit the various components of the advertisement in a single message, with each component marked by some delimiter.
- a decision is made whether there are more instructions to provide to the advertiser.
- the decision of whether more instructions are to be provided can be made, for example, by an instructions component (e.g., instructions component 210 of FIG. 2).
- the instructions component provides instructions in a manner similar to an interactive message response system, whereby the advertiser sends a message to the instruction component including an identification of which instruction menu page is desired, and the instruction component responds with the requested instruction menu page.
- the instruction component provides all of the instruction pages at once, and the advertiser can navigate the pages based upon a structured order in which the instruction messages were sent.
- one or more messages can be received from the advertiser at stage 415.
- the one or more messages can be received, for example, by a messaging interface (e.g., messaging interface 150 of FIG. 2) in conjunction with an advertisement generation component (e.g., advertisement generation component 220 of FIG. 2).
- the entire advertisement is received in a single message, while in other implementations, the advertisement is received over multiple messages.
- the one or more message can include both advertisement information (e.g., a creative) and target audience information (e.g., targeted search terms, demographic information, etc.)
- the message is parsed.
- the message can be parsed, for example, by an advertisement generation component (e.g., advertisement generation component 220 of FIG. 2).
- An advertisement in a single message can include delimiters operable to separate the various fields that can be requested by the messaging interface (e.g., including title/header, advertisement body, link, target audience, bidding information, billing information, etc.). Such a message is thereby parsed based upon the delimiters within the message. Advertisements received in multiple messages can be parsed according to the order in which the messages were received. In some implementations, instructions can be provided to the advertiser to alert the advertiser as to how to format the advertisement submission.
- the process 400 can determine whether the one or more messages include auction, billing and/or target audience information. The determination of whether the one or more messages include auction, billing, and/or target audience information can be made, for example, by the advertisement generation component (e.g., advertisement generation component 220 of FIG. 2). If the one or more messages do not include advertisement information, the process 400 can send a request to submit advertisement information at stage 440. The request to submit advertisement information can be sent, for example, by the instructions component (e.g., instructions component 210 of FIG. 2).
- the instructions component e.g., instructions component 210 of FIG. 2
- the process 400 can generate an advertisement at stage 445.
- the advertisement can be generated, for example, by a messaging interface (e.g., messaging interface 150 of FIG. 2) in conjunction with an advertisement generation component (e.g., advertisement generation component 220 of FIG. 2).
- the advertisement generated can be a targeted text advertisement, a targeted graphical advertisement, a targeted video advertisement, a targeted audio advertisement, etc.
- the advertisement is provided for targeted distribution.
- the advertisement can be provided for targeted distribution, for example, by an advertising management system (e.g., advertising management system 104 of FIG. 1 ).
- the advertisement can be served with search results when search terms related to the advertisement are submitted to a search engine.
- the advertisement can be served based upon a request from a web publisher for advertisements to be included within his/her web page.
- spam detection processes are used to identify spam messages that may be sent by use of the messaging interface.
- Messages classified as spam messages are ignored and not processed further.
- Such techniques can include comparing sending addresses (e.g., numbers) of the received message to a list of known spam addresses. If the sending address of the received message is on the spam address list, then the message is classified as spam.
- Another technique includes comparing the received messages to other received messages that are received within a time window. If a number of messages are highly similar, then the messages are classified as spam. Other spam detection processes can also be used.
