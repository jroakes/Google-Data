In each side of the disclosure that shows can be arranged, replace, combine, separate and design with various different configurations,
All these considerations all herein.
In addition, unless otherwise indicated by context, the feature otherwise shown in each attached drawing can be in combination with one another.Cause
This, it should attached drawing is generally considered as to the part of one or more overview embodiments, is interpreted as and the not all feature shown
It is required for each embodiment.
This disclosure relates to the method and system of the defects of image for detecting and correcting collection.These defects may be by
The defects of image sensor element, causes.Lacked for example, " heat " pixel is a class formation common in imaging sensor and/or electricity
Fall into.The defects of hot pixels are by being introduced in the impurity in imaging sensor base material and manufacturing process is caused.Impurity and defect
It may cause the increase of dark current leakage in photodetector.In the case of not being illuminated, hot pixels are by its own table
It is now the sensor element of the photodetector currents (such as high dark current) with abnormal level.These sensor elements can be with
Corresponding to brighter than the normal pixel of surrounding pixel in the image of collection.Similarly, even in illumination when, dead pixel by its
Manifest itself by the sensor element with zero or abnormal low photodetector currents.Such sensor element can correspond to
In gathering pixel more darker than the normal pixel of surrounding in image.In some cases, defective sensor element may be forever
It is stuck in long or intermittently the grade of high (white), low (black) or middle (ash).
Defective sensor element can reduce acquired image quality.However, usually by using corresponding to defective
The value of pixel of sensor element replace with the estimate or average value of adjacent pixel, this can be corrected during image procossing
The influence of a little defects.In order to perform such correction, it is thus necessary to determine that the position of these defective pixels.
A kind of mode that defective sensor element is detected from image is (so as to maximum in the prolonged time for exposure
Change the stored charge of leak sensor element) the dark image of collection (secretly to keep photoelectric current from low-level incident illumination), usually
(to increase leakage current and to maximize stored charge again) under elevated device temperature.Collection dark image usually needs
The ability for wanting (for example, optical shutter) to block the light entered by camera lens.However, since space and cost limit, movement is set
Standby camera is generally not provided physical shutter.
Alternatively possible method is that collection illumination image (or is placed in front of imaging lens in the case where removing camera lens
Diffuser element), any scene characteristic and protrude abnormal pixel to obscure.But this method is not in a mobile device
Practical, they usually have the fixed lens that cannot be removed.
Alternatively, hot pixels can be identified during test is manufactured and be stored as the calibration number of given image sensor
According to.However, since known sensor element behavior is changed over time (for example, sensor element may fail with the time or can
Their characteristic can intermittently be changed), therefore also want to perform the scene of hot pixels after equipment has been transported to user
Calibration.In this way, due to lacking optical shutter in light path, traditional mobile equipment camera, which cannot provide satisfied method, to be come at the scene
Perform this recalibration.
Disclosed system and method provide identification and compensate hot pixels and the alternative of other open defects.Can be with
A series of images is gathered, each image therein is gathered under the different focal setting of camera lens.For example, can be automatic
The image " burst " is conveniently carried out during focusing on (AF) scanning.In certain embodiments, image burst can occur automatic
After (AE) process of exposure, it can provide the Image Acquisition for being chosen so as to the saturation for preventing given scenario and/or under-exposure
Set (for example, time for exposure, ISO, gain etc.).
A series of images can be averaged or otherwise be combined to provide cohesive image.Due to being set in different focal
Under visual field scaling and each image be to be shot in the case where different focuses is set, so cohesive image will be likely to mould
Paste and no clearly feature.In this case, the hot pixels and other abnormal pixels influenced from lens blur will
It is clearly defined for fuzzy cohesive image.In this way, edge detection algorithm or another type of contrast are sensitive special
Sign recognizer can more effectively identify and map abnormality sensor element for correcting later.Disclosed system and method
Pass through the one group of image gathered during being used effectively in AF processes so that imaging sensor may be recalibrated automatically at the scene
Open defect.When performing recalibration in the scene fully illuminated (as the common situation during AF is scanned),
It may also detect that the other kinds of open defect (for example, dark pixel, dust granule) in addition to hot pixels.
Process disclosed herein needs not rely on clear and definite user action.For example, the process of recalibration can be in each AF
Either periodically (for example, during every 10th AF is scanned or after camera powers on) is automatic during scanning occurs.In addition
Ground or alternatively, user can perform this recalibration according to order (for example, passing through menu, soft key and/or shutter release button).
The calibration method can utilize the calculating imaging technique based on burst acquisition and burst processing, and can provide and be set from movement
The improvement of the picture quality of standby camera.

Fig. 3 A-3E illustrate multiple operating aspects of optical imaging system according to example embodiment.For example, Fig. 3 A are shown
The side view and top view of Image Acquisition scene 300 according to example embodiment.Image Acquisition scene 300 can include each difference
The object 302,304 and 306 being located at relative to camera as shown in Figure 1 and described at low coverage, middle-range and remote location.
In addition, object 302,304 and 306 can be respectively relative to optical imaging system 100 optical axis 308 be arranged in left side, center and
At the position on right side.
Although Fig. 3 A include only including the scene of object 302,304 and 306, it is to be understood that, in order to succinct and explanation
Purpose provides such simplify and describes.Optical imaging system 100, which can be configured as, gathers more complicated scene.For example, light
Imaging system 100 is learned to may be configured to any amount of object or feature (or lacking this object or feature) can be included
Multiple and different scene imagings.
Fig. 3 B show the multiple images gathered by optical imaging system 100 according to example embodiment.Acquired image
Can represent as shown in Figure 3A with the picture frame that is gathered in the Image Acquisition scene 300.In the exemplary embodiment, light is worked as
When imaging system 100 is carrying out AF processing, the optical element in different focal setting can be utilized to gather multiple images
Or image burst (burst).Each image in multiple images can include sensor element that is defective and/or blocking.
However, such sensor element is likely difficult to identify based on the pixel value from single image.In such scene, AF
Processing, which can be included in while focal length is set from nearly focus adjustment to remote focal length, gathers multiple images.For example, in collection the
While one frame 310, the focal length setting of optical element (for example, at least one camera lens) may correspond to nearly burnt position.In this way, object
302 (near the objects of optical imaging system 100) can be expressed as focusing on (in-focus) object 312 in the first frame 310,
And object 304 and 306 can be expressed as defocus (out-of-focus) object 314 and 316 in the first frame 310.Based on focal length
It is set as nearly burnt position, the first frame 310 there can be the first visual field.
While the second frame 320 are gathered, the focal position of optical element can correspond to middle or moderate distance Jiao
Point position.(in apart from object) can be expressed as focal object 324 in the second frame 320 in this way, object 304, and 302 He of object
306 can be expressed as defocus object 322 and 326 in the second frame 320.Middle-range position, the second frame are set as based on focal length
320 can have the second visual field.
When gathering three frames 330, the focal position of optical element may correspond to the focal position of distant place or infinity.This
Sample, object 306 (distant object) can be represented as focal object 336 in the 3rd frame 330, and object 302 and 304 can be
Defocus object 332 and 334 is denoted respectively as in 3rd frame 330.It is remote location based on focal length setting, the 3rd frame 330 can be with
With the 3rd visual field.
In addition, as shown in Figure 3B, each focal position produces different optical amplifier systems used by optical element 120
Number, so as to cause the different visual fields at each focal position.This phenomenon is commonly known as " focus breathing (focusing
breathing)”.This behavior as a result, projected to by optical element the scenario objects 302 on imaging sensor, 304,
306 fine-feature is set according to focus changes its position in image is gathered.(afterwards, when the image of these collections is by group
When closing (for example, being averaged) together, this misalignment of fine-feature causes these features that mould occurs in cohesive image 340
Paste.
It should be appreciated that, there is provided the purpose that picture frame 310,320 and 330 is merely to illustrate that, and can be according to herein
The system and method for description gather more or fewer picture frames.In addition, the picture frame of collection need not include in visual field
Any focal object.That is, acquired image frame need not be focused on completely or partially.
Fig. 3 C show cohesive image 340 according to example embodiment.Cohesive image 340 can be by combination from multiple
The respective pixel of image (for example, the first image 310, the second image 320 and the 3rd image 330) is formed.Combination is from multiple
(pixel-by-pixel) pixel-by-pixel that the pixel of image can include image is combined.Additionally or alternatively, can add, again
Increase and/or each segment (tile) of average each image or meshing are to provide cohesive image 340.Other can be used
Method combines or polymerize the pixel from multiple acquired images.
In the exemplary embodiment, cohesive image 340 can include fuzzy feature.By being gathered during being aggregated in AF scannings
Image and be incorporated into the ambiguity in scene characteristic may at least due to：A) visual field of image is made to contract while focus is changed
Put (for example, " breathing ")；And b) based on the defocused object in focal position and subject depth collection scene.Even if some objects exist
Focused in some respective image frames of multiple images, it is both above-mentioned if gathering multiple images while focal position is adjusted
The characteristics of image of polymerization can be caused to occur to obscure.
In the exemplary embodiment, fuzzy object 342,344 and 346 can be appeared in cohesive image 340, it can distinguish
It is the fuzzy expression of object 302,304 and 306.In addition, some clearly (for example, not fuzzy or at least more unambiguous) is right
As being probably obvious in the scene.For example, characteristics of image 348 can relate to the defective sensor element for causing hot pixels.
Characteristics of image 350 can include the dust granule directly on the surface of imaging sensor.In other words, dust granules may hide
One or more sensors element is kept off, this may cause to seem very dark shape.It is (such as fine that the shape may look like dust
Dimension or other kinds of identifiable particle), and may seem to be apparent from (for example, being to focus on), this depends on dust
Actually it is coupled or is attached on which optical element.Characteristics of image 352 can include causing having for dead pixel or dark pixel
The sensor element of defect.In addition, characteristics of image 354 can include causing the defective of " blocking " or permanent gray-level pixels
Sensor element.
At least due to characteristics of image 348,350,352 and 354 is included in cohesive image 340 and is not substantially based on optics
The focal position of element, so characteristics of image 348,350,352 and 354 can seem clear or focus on.That is, image
Feature 348,350,352 and 354 is probably due to the sensor element level the defects of or caused by blocking.These defects will not be because
It is not allowed optical dimming occur for focus, and it will not be changed in single image since optical amplifier changes (" breathing ")
Position.In this way, the Pixel-level of such characteristics of image represents that focusing can be appeared substantially in cohesive image 340.
Each characteristics of image can be based on edge detection (edge-detection) algorithm, Contrast Detection algorithm or its
His shape/image recognition algorithm determines.In the exemplary embodiment, can be via based on search and/or zero passage edge (zero-
Crossing edge) detection method detects picture rich in detail feature.In addition, Canny edge detections, difference edge detection and
Canny-Deriche edge detection algorithms are all specifically contemplated herein.
In general, image recognition algorithm, which may be operative to have in identification cohesive image 340, deviates considerably from adjacent pixel
Brightness degree (or collective's brightness degree) pixel or pixel group.For example, can be based on the brightness degree with adjacent pixel
Difference differs by more than threshold levels to identify characteristics of image.In the exemplary embodiment, luminance threshold level can be that given color is led to
50 gray scales in road.If in this way, given pixel in cohesive image 340 with close on and/or adjacent pixel compared with brightness
Brighter or darker 50 or the brightness degree more than 50, then the given pixel and corresponding sensor element can be identified as
It is defective and/or be blocked.It should be understood that other threshold levels are possible.For example, threshold level can be 25 bright
Degree is horizontal, or 250 luminance levels.Relatively low threshold value can include increased sensor element part.Therefore, in some feelings
Under condition, image definition may be due to excessively becoming negatively affected comprising sensor element.Therefore, in certain embodiments,
Threshold level can be adjusted based on desired or selection compensation level.In addition, multiple threshold levels can be adjustable,
To compensate the sensor element associated with multiple Color Channels.In certain embodiments, the threshold level of given pixel can
Noise level and/or sensor element noise model based on adjacent pixel and change.
For example, given pixel can have 200 brightness degree, and its eight immediate adjacent pixels each have
Brightness degree equal to or less than 150.In the above-mentioned scene with the luminance level that threshold level is 50, based on relative luminance
Horizontal difference is poor equal to or more than threshold level, and given pixel can be identified as to pixel that is heat or blocking.
As it is used herein, " adjacent " pixel can include " nearest neighbor " (for example, being directly adjacent to) pixel.Additionally
Or alternatively, adjacent pixel can include away from being confirmed as dead, hot, pixel limited distance that is blocking and/or being blocked
Interior one or more pixels (for example, 2 to 5 pixels).
In certain embodiments, can further be studied by observing the output of given sensor element during AE sequences
Defective/property of sensor element for being blocked.For example, the output of given sensor element can provide indication sensor
Element whether be dead section, thermal element or zero defect component information.That is, if sensor element is unlike adjacent elements
Light is responded like that, it may be considered that it is dead sensor element.

Automatic exposure AE processes 372, it can occur between to and tl.As AE processing 372 as a result, light shape can be based on
Condition, user setting and/or camera are set to select some or all exposures to set.
Image Acquisition scene 370 can include automatic focusing AF processes 374, it can occur between t1 and t2.In AF
During processing 374, can be gathered while mobile optical element (for example, lens) multiple images (for example, the first frame 310, the
Two frames 320 and the 3rd frame 330).Therefore, can be with each in different focal length setting shooting multiple images.In AF processes
After 374, camera can be considered as relative to focusing and/or scene is " focusing ".
After multiple images are gathered, cohesive image 340 can be handled from described image.Cohesive image 340 can by into
One step processing, to identify defective sensing based on the corresponding pixel of defective sensor element in cohesive image 340
The position of device element.Information on the position of defective sensor element can be used for making or update sensor element shape
State mapping graph 360.In the exemplary embodiment, cohesive image 340 and sensor element state mapping graph 360 can be by processors simultaneously

When optical imaging system focuses on for example since t2, payload image 380 can be gathered.Payload image
380 can be single image, a series of images (burst) or video flowing.The collection of payload image 380 can be triggered by user
(for example, by pressing shutter release button) or its can automatically be triggered.In the exemplary embodiment, payload image 380
It can be collected immediately after AF processes terminate, so that shutter delay minimizes.As shown in FIGURE 3 E, can be in cohesive image
340 and sensor element situation mapping graph 360 payload image 380 is gathered still processed while.However, payload
Image 380 can be gathered alternatively in other times.
After gathering payload image 380 and having handled sensor element situation mapping graph 360, it can correct effectively
Load chart 380 in order to provide correction payload image 382.In the exemplary embodiment, payload image 380 can be with base
It is conditioned in sensor element state mapping graph 360.It is for example, scarce corresponding to having in sensor element state mapping graph 360
Pixel value in the payload image of sunken sensor element can be replaced by the average value of the value of adjacent pixel.In other words
Say, representing the brightness value of the pixel in the payload image 380 of the signal from defective sensor element can be had
Imitate load chart 380 in around and/or adjacent pixel average value substitute.As an example, replacement values can be four nearest
