Embodiment
Fig. 1 is the concept map of the macro operation illustrated in trustship computing system 100.This operation can be compared with the macro operation on following client devices or server, wherein, create grand and/or attempt to access grand while the grand desk-top computer of user from them, net book computing machine or the common computer from the computing machine such as Internet bar copying to grand memory location is run application time, by starting macro operation from various client computer, this client devices or server are directed to single client device (such as, being served or VPN by Remote desk process).And can be limited by first user and share grand restrict access grand easily between users, restrict access allows other users (such as, and initial user from the user of the same domain access system) run macro when using the application of oneself.And, perform grand, such as, when the input beyond user and subscriber computer triggers grand execution even if also can be user when user is not online.In addition, when mandatory system has a multiple registered user be relative to each other (such as they are the work of same establishment), that runs in mandatory system grandly can produce complicated workflow, and these workflows are distributed in and store corresponding to the application of multiple this user and/or data.
As noted, can be triggered grand by external event, such as, by receiving email message.Grandly may operate in the client of user and run on the grand server subsystem of any subsystem separating that other are served or apply.Such as, service on other subsystems can comprise grand access to obtain any service of information, comprise internal services (such as location-based service and E-mail service) and third party's service (such as, from online shop or auction site, the weather forecast website etc. of business) of main system.
The user writing macrocode can be allowed to write grand in unified consistent mode with the grand server subsystem of system relationship, this makes programming experience is easy concerning terminal user.Such as, can for showing the different service definition object models of terminal user, service such as operates electrical form and calendar, acquisition Web content, sends Email, the calendar of accessing them, cypher text etc.Object model such as uses Java object to represent.Each Java object can pack the method for access underlying services.Electrical form and service for language translation can use inner straight-forward network to call (such as remote procedure call), and network-content acquisition such as can use SOAP or similar service.These services a lot of do not need directly to show terminal user.
Which floor " packaging " is system 100 by creating or " decoration " eliminates risk internal services being showed terminal user around bottom Java object.Such as, system 100 can comprise limit forces layer, and it limits the number of times that given user can call given service.System 100 can comprise and allows the safe floor of fine-grained access control (such as allowing carry out read access to bottom data but do not allow write access), and safe floor can use capability-based security strategy.System 100 also can comprise daily record layer, and it can be caught all users and call and the record providing user conversation.Uniformly instead of especially limit and security strategy are applied for all services, thus the chance (namely final security breaches) of programmer error can be reduced.
System 100 can comprise for the grand various computer implemented mechanism of supervisory computer, wherein grand code storage by the position in the trustship computer system of internet access, and grand be exercisable to perform following function.Receive such as from after the grand request of the execution of the application operated on the long-range client computer of trustship computer system, can perform grand in trustship computer system.Such as, grandly can directly to run in grand manager or its communicative couplings parts.The grand result of execution can be supplied to operation application on a client computer (such as, operating in the spreadsheet application in the browser of subscriber computer).In this case, can be grand in the file external memory of operation and access macrocode from programming.Such as, although code can perform on trusteeship service server, but on the notebook computer that the electrical form that macrocode upgrades can be positioned at user or other positions of trusteeship service, freely can point to any number of application access that are grand and that run from any multiple users of representative registration trusteeship service grand in these places.
In some implementations, eachly grandly can to associate with the registered user of trustship computer system, and the restrict access can determined according to registered user make grand other users becoming trustship computer system can (specifically, make the grand application to the account of other users is run available).Such as, " have " grand user and determine authorized other grand users using him by the user ID of other users or by the group belonging to these users.In other situations, user can be provided to grand link or URL and comprise some authority associated with run macro.
Can be that registered user's one or more groups of distributing define restrict access by trustship computer system.Such as, user can authorize the group of " MyOnlineFriends (online good friend) " by name to grand access, and authority is given everyone in this group, this can represent " good friend " that this user on his social network sites (such as Facebook, Orkut etc.) identifies.
In some implementations, can receive and perform grand request, these requests are from multiple application that the multiple different client computer of trustship computer remote runs.Such as, application can generate or start " event ", and in grand definition, these events are designed for and start grand execution, or recover after waiting status or continue grand execution.System 100 can be each request autoexec macros from this position in trustship computer system.System 100 also grandly can be supplied to each respective application in multiple application performing grand result in response to performing.In some implementations, multiple application correspond to single account everyone.Such as, the grand each application of request execution can reception result.In some implementations, multiple application correspond to multiple different account everyone (such as, multiple registered users of system 100).
Perform and grandly comprise the multiple different trusteeship service of calling trustship computer system and providing.Such as, grandly call calendar service, contact service, position provide service (such as the service of indicating user position or user's friend location) etc.As an alternative, or as additional, perform and grandly comprise the network service (such as, be positioned at different territories from trustship computer system, with by the tissue manipulation different from trustship computer system) calling the third party informant independent of trustship computer system and provide.
Can also apply trustship computer system performs first the information produced and become the second form from the first format conversion, the information changed can be provided to the second application that trustship computer system is run.Such as, the data of comma description form can be created by text processing application, then data can be supplied to spreadsheet application, paste electronic form unit grid to use the distinctive form of spreadsheet application.
Perform the multiple different account that grand result also can be supplied to the multiple different users in the registration of trustship computer system automatically.Such as, grand execution result can be supplied to the some users in some computer systems, such as upgrade their system each on common electronic form unit grid.In some implementations, receive the request of run macro in response to the browser on the client computer of Web page loading, the webpage loaded has the grand pointer of JavaScript on the grand executive subsystem that points in trustship computer system.Such as, by transmit link or URL to grand come shared grand time, can to link or URL form provides and performs grand request (such as using JavaScript or any other relational language).
Now more specifically referring to Fig. 1, as the example realizing above-mentioned all or part of function, system 100 comprises one or more application 102 (the grand hook 104 of each application access, this causes grand execution when accessing grand), one or more external event 105, grand server subsystem 106, social networks 108, location-based service 110 and macrocode 112.
Application 102 can comprise and can excite by user any applicable application running or perform, such as e-mail applications, spreadsheet application, text processing application, photo sharing application, presentation bag, financial plan application etc.Under certain situation, user can start application clearly by selecting the application that will run, such as, by double-clicking the Apply Names on desktop or in the drop-down list of application.Also other application can impliedly be started, such as, when user clicks e-mail attachment (such as text or electrical form), or when user clicks unknown file, any one in both of these case all can start to perform and the respective application of file association automatically, such as, based on extension name or other associations defined of file.User can also start application, the application of such as trustship by navigating to the URL being directed to application.
Start or perform in another example of application, event 105 can occur, such as, receive email message, event 105 can start or recover to perform certain application.Such as, event 105 (email message such as received) can trigger grand (such as, upgrade electrical form, increase header line).Can with mandatory system runs, follow the tracks of the event handler carrying out the event of each user registered in system and detect the generation of event.Can report each event, then event can associate with specific action, such as, perform grand action, then can trigger action.
Each application 102 may have access to grand hook 104.In the simplest implementation, grand hook can be pointing system 100 stores and the URL of executable macrocode on the system 100 simply.Such as, hook 104 can be the URL pointing to JavaScript code, can be included in webpage, like this, during certain event that Web page loading or generation associate with operation web page, can access and operation code.Except to contribute to defining in application 102 grand, or alternatively, grand hook 104 can perform event tracking and provide the connection between external event 105 and grand server subsystem 106.Such as, grand hook 104 user can be allowed to define that the event relevant with the Email received in e-mail applications 102 be associated is grand.Grandly can identify the object different from the available object of e-mail applications 102.In addition, the language of grand macrocode 112 can be different with the grand own language in e-mail applications 102.Grand hook 104 also can be followed the tracks of and grand relevant any event, and can be in time mutual with grand server subsystem 106.Grand hook 104 can be selected record macro by user or perform existing grand option to come instantiation or realization.
External event 105 can comprise the multiple event for triggering grand execution, comprise and receive email message (such as, in e-mail applications), determine that (such as being determined by application) certain condition exists (such as in excess of the quota, refusal user access, process completes) etc.Can follow the tracks of such event with event handler, can be wish that performing one or more grand each user when there is particular event in system 100 registers the particular event that will follow the tracks of with event handler.
In some implementations, event can be embedded in code, such as, when line code is determined to meet certain condition (such as, variable reaches certain value, or completes evening such as book keeping operation renewal etc.).External event 105 also can comprise the detection to message, and the RSS of such as text message, blog entries, arrival subscribes to.External event 105 can comprise detecting in online auction site issues special article, and such as by inch of candle the title of article or description (such as old-fashioned the Vatican licence plate) are determined.
The trigger condition of external event 105 can comprise different condition combination.Such as, to trigger and e-mail applications pertinent events condition used can comprise that Email Header is capable, sender ID (such as boss, spouse, child etc.), addressee (such as use whether " transmission ", the combination of " making a copy for " and " close send ", addressee's number (notify when such as, I is unique consignee me etc.), the position whether having annex, transmission Email, message text key word or Email are likely spams.The condition corresponding with text processing application can comprise document size, document source, document creation date and/or revise date, document author etc. recently.For spreadsheet application, the condition that can be used for trigger event comprises the value of specific electron table cell, whether the value of cell changes, the line number of real data or columns, electrical form author, electrical form size etc. in electrical form.Whether the condition being applicable to other types document can comprise document and just change.Other trigger events can be produced, the wind spout alarm to specific cities and towns that such as online weather service website is issued by the source on network or service.In this case, be concerned about that the user of weather may construct grandly intercept the external event relevant with weather and send text to its household or neighbours and/or send a telegraph.
Event also can be the combination of multiple not homology.Such as, email trigger primary event can be received by from specific user at first, but, only just perform grand when the user this event and use location follow-up service occur determining to send or receive Email is in ad-hoc location.Also the additional or condition of replacement of the information used from other services can be utilized.
Grand server subsystem 106 can particular event in supervisory system 100, such as, apply 102 events (such as email message etc.) propagated.(such as delay with server XYZ, apply communicating of ABC or user John Duo Yi except the available event accomplishing the instruction of grand server subsystem 106, until receive further notice), the interested particular event of grand server subsystem 106 can comprise any dependent event of available grand process.
Various service can event trigger, the form of the grand input run in response to trigger or grand output and system 100 mutual.Such as, social networks 108 can provide how to process the useful information of event to determining to system 100.For example, grandly may be defined to the executable operations when receiving the Email sending to BETTY BOOP, but the only just executable operations when a good friend (such as, as in one or more social networks define) of mail from BETTY BOOP.In another example, grand be designed to BETTY BOOP all " good friends " (as social network sites or social groups define) transmission autoelectrinic mail or other notices.The tissue of operation social networks 108 can be different with the tissue of operation subsystem 106, and the operator of last system 108 provides the access to some information by API, and provides the access to the content that the operator giving subsystem 106 accesses like this.
In another example, position follow-up service 110 can be followed the tracks of when user invites and the position of mobile device of user-association, and such as user can find their good friend like this, and vice versa.Such as, grand may be defined to sends Email or text to user, and the destination of Email or text can be depending on user present position at that time.Such as, if user holds cell phone or other mobile devices (such as based on the equipment of GPS), so position follow-up service 110 can be followed the tracks of or know customer location.According to customer location, by performing grand, Email that is that propagate can be sent to the mobile device of user or the equipment (such as, if user is near home, or location-based service 110 determines that user may go to this direction) of family.
Send except the equipment of such as User support GPS " at which am I? " outside positional information, user also by position follow-up service 110 receives " which I go this to? " information.This information such as can comprise gps coordinate or simple text message (such as, " turn at this, then go up a hill 10107 ").
Subsystem 106 can store, follow the tracks of, access, share and perform the various examples of macrocode.Form grand macrocode 112 and can adopt any suitable language, but typically write by the preferred macrolanguage (such as JavaScript etc.) that system 100 uses or programme.Perform to be familiar with mode due to grand, macrocode 112 that grand server subsystem 106 can be resolved (or search), about function or about grand segment, any other function or grand that such as " obtain title " function 114, " inspection title " function 116, " obtaining position " function 118 or grand server subsystem 106 will be considered.Being embedded in any function in macrocode 112 or operating to cause grand server subsystem 106 to perform dissimilar process, such as, check the mandate etc. of user's access file.
Macrocode 112 can be stored in various position, such as central grand warehouse or the Entrust Server system by internet access.In some implementations, the whole set of macrocode 112 can distributed storage logically being bound together by one or more network.In some implementations, when macrocode 112 is responsive (such as it comprises or upgrades the personal information of user) or due to when national defence reason is classified (such as, secret, top secret etc.), macrocode 112 can be stored explicitly on independently position, such as, be positioned on security server.
In some implementations, " audiomonitor " can be used to carry out event tracking.Such as, load electrical form on the server and when its HTML being sent to browser, the server end event that instruction has opened new electrical form can be triggered.Then, the audiomonitor monitored on the Spreadsheet server of this event can check whether it has the script listing of this electrical form.If do not have script listing, audiomonitor can be made a phone call (such as, to script server), mainly says, " having any script for this electrical form? ", and transmit electrical form keyword, then preserve script listing.Then, the event handler on Spreadsheet server can check whether any script method that there is " onOpen " by name.If there is this script method, server can send message (such as to Google application scenarios server) and perform the method.This flow process also can be used for other situations, such as editor's event etc.
In another example, grandly can associate with e-mail applications, this e-mail applications arranges to be used for performing and such as depends on whether header line, Email sender, email message have very large electrical form annex, whether have certain Message routing of the annex of (any type) etc.The grand all right use location information defined by this way, the positional information such as provided by position follow-up service 110.Such as, if send to the email message of user job Email to have large electrical form annex, and determine that user is in (because the gps signal of the mobile device from user is corresponding to the position being registered as user house), then grand being created as forwards the home email of copy to user.In this case, annex may be and the relevant electrical form of work, needs to be that demonstration in work in second day or project are checked.Alternatively, in these situations near discovery user stays out, grand being created as can be sent little message to the mobile device of the support Email of user, the existence of this mail of reminding user.
Under both of these case, macrocode 112 can be left out from causing any e-mail applications 102 of grand execution and be stored on grand server subsystem 106.To the email message of each arrival received, e-mail applications 102 can trigger grand by pointing to macrocode with hook 104.Then, grand can each side of identification message, whether such as specific sender is the member of everyone social networks of account.If social networks check result is affirmative, grandly can check that position follow-up service 110 is to determine the geographic position of account everyone or sender further, and the execution of some action can be caused based on such position.Such as, in some cases, grand server subsystem 106 can based on the position informing account of account everyone (or user) everyone.In other situations, grand server subsystem 106 can make everyone called of account (such as by using the Global Link words route system of VOIP), and/or causes the transmission of SMS message, or other actions macrodefined.
Grandly variously can should be used for obtaining and this information is provided via one or more certified API, by what access system 100 was run.Subsystem 106 can have multiple different API Transformation Service, and like this, author can write single macrolanguage for subsystem 106, but still may be used for different application.
Grandly can bring some benefits independent of trustship on the grand server subsystem of user's client computing device.Such as, can use in many different application grand.And can trigger grand when user is online from various access point, access point is such as their desk-top computer, other people computing machine, net book or smart phone, even and if user not online or on their computers time also can trigger grand.This grand be defined by intercepting one class application (such as Email) event and upgrade other application in data (such as electrical form, the wherein header line of the arrival email message of automatic compiling user in electrical form).
Another benefit can copy grand and completely shared grand between users ability without the need to manual.On the contrary, to each grand one or more level of security can be set, allow the access as created or first preserve grand user other users determined.Such as, user can set grand access security rank and grand URL is supplied to another people as the common web page attribute of such as line picture sharing site does.
In some cases, on grand server subsystem, the grand benefit of trustship also there are provided for the grand ability of the data run from various user, or the result of run macro is supplied to the ability of various user.Such as, grand can be used for of sharing, is combined into larger books the contribution of multiple author, the poem that such as many people write or article.The document of each contributor can be kept at precalculated position, if contributor provides the authority of this position of access, grandly just can access this position.Then, can combination after books be made each contributor and may more users can single document.As another example, can use the grand establishment business procedure application on trustship subsystem, wherein document is always local preserves on the server systems, such as, transmit document and examine.
Fig. 2 is the schematic diagram that can operate shared grand trustship computer system 200.Generally speaking, system 200 provides and illustrates that user can create grand and preserve on mandatory system, shares, access and perform all parts of this grand example.
In this system 200, grand server subsystem 202 is provided in script information and stores the position of data storage 206 being preserved in a consistent manner macrocode, wherein preserved information can comprise macrolibrary title, content for script and grand proprietary identifier (such as, using fuzzy user ID or other identifiers).During run macro, order can be sent to grand server subsystem 202 given grand to perform.Then, data storage 206 can be stored from script information and obtain code, and example can be created in script engine or script actuator 208.
Can build the Java object of the programming API representing the application of different server end, and can be packaged in capability-based safety packaging, and it is visible through packaging service (or " program joint (bean) ") to become programmer.Packaged service 210 can comprise grand server subsystem 202 can such as to all related services that through the consumer of packaging service provide relevant with grand execution.Packaged service 210 can be any related object of one group of other object, through encapsulation to make them easily be passed.
Packaged service can comprise the Java service agent of displaying and the mutual public method of back-end services.In the encapsulation that public method can be included in other instruments provided for method for packing, class, character string, electrical form, application programming interface (API) and various computerese (such as Java etc.) or other mechanism.Public method can be shown, and (or becoming public) such as can be used for defining and performs grand resource.Some details of the implementation of public method can be maintained secrecy, and this can provide the Information hiding of appropriate level and abstract.Public method is similar between multiple dissimilar object, shows the look and feel consistent to a certain degree, thus provide a kind of polymorphism of rank to grand user.As a result, this organizes the grand use that packaged service can contribute to the user in object-oriented, event driven environment.
In this example system 200, these packaged services or program joint can be attached to top layer Java object, and this object has the public member (such as electrical form, calendar etc.) of each attribute.The preset label of this top layer Java object standard is inserted in the environmental field of script actuator.In some implementations, script actuator informs script environment public member (and being only public member).
Thus, when the JavaScript code of user performs following code,
vardoc＝google.spreadsheets.create("mynewdoc")；(1)
Call " create " Java method in " spreadsheets " field of top object in Java object.The ambiguous identification symbol that the Java of the method realizes independent variable (such as " mynewdoc ") and the script operator using " CREATE " order and correspond to new title carries out remote procedure call to Spreadsheet server.Spreadsheet server creates new electrical form in response to remote procedure call and returns its keyword.Grand server creates the new Java object that representative comprises the electrical form of the new establishment of new keywords.Java object comprises the method for multiple spreadsheet operations, such as " rename ", " insertSheet " etc.This object to be also packaged in capability-based safety packaging and to be returned.Script actuator this object interior packing NativeJavaObject packaging in and returned to above-mentioned variable " doc ".
In some implementations of package object, any service (such as electrical form, calendar, Email etc.) suitably can the object of return package in Java dynamic proxy.Different agency can be there is, such as, for safety, daily record and limit.Each agency can engage or use the description (such as, Java interface, such as " Spreadsheet ", " SpreadsheetRange ", " EmailService " etc.) showing which service, this definable public method.Can note be there is in interface, be applicable to Different Package.
Such as, " create " method in electrical form service can create new electrical form.The method can have one and explain as follows, statement the method is WRITE method, there is provided such as warn user's script can attempt to they electronic form document group write (and if user's with no authorized to script WRITE privilege, then run time script can failure) mechanism.Substantially, safety packaging contributes to ensureing that requested permissions (WRITE etc.) that given method states is in the authorization token of user.If method is authorized to, just pass to lower one deck calling.
The number of times can also accessed about grand operation by restriction specific user provides safety.In order to perform this function." create " method can exist limit to explain, explanation should count calling of the method according to terminal user " createspreadsheet " limit.Limit packaging can call or use limit service come tracing preset user cause operation perform number of times.If such as user is in excess of the quota, the method can be made mistakes, if do not have in excess of the quota, is just again passed to lower one deck.Can calculate user's limit, such as one day, one week or one month within the time period of setting, and limit can reset at time cycle point or successively decrease.
The daily record layer recording the character string version of the independent variable provided and each method called can also provide grand execution record.
Packaging service-creation device 212 can create the service of top layer packaging, and its degree depends on grand and environment.Such as, packaging service-creation device 212 can check that the terminal user of run macro clearly gives grand ability, and the top-level procedure that can create corresponding to Macro Flags saves.State such as can comprise current document (if existence) (such as Email, text document, picture, electrical form etc.) and user authentication.Packaging service-creation device 212 can produce the top layer packaging service of ability based on environment, and can packaged service 210 is injected in the execution environment of script actuator 208, and user such as can define and perform grand in this context.In some sense, can think that packaging service-creation device 212 is manufacturer or the factory of program joint, or " program joint factory ".
The type of the packaged service 210 that can create such as comprises the example of the capacity packing of spreadsheet application, calendar application etc.This Java object can be inserted execution scope.Object (such as, with mark " TopLevel ") can be identified with the source of object.Thus, such as " TopLevel.spreadsheets " can become the reference (such as SpreadsheetApplicationApi object) to capacity packing object.The public method of object can be reflected in JavaScript programmed environment as Java object and can make it to become grand available.
Such as, following JavaScript code can be opened existing electrical form (such as, being called the electrical form of " MyOtherDoc ") and the value of current spreadsheet cell A1 be copied to the cell B2 of new electrical form.
vardoc＝google.spreadsheets.getActiveSpreadsheet()；
varotherDoc＝google.spreadsheets.openByName("MyOtherDoc")；
varvalue＝doc.find("A1").getValue()；
OtherDoc.find (" B2 ") .setValue (value); (3) the same with every other object, the Java object of the Range object returned as " find " method is ability packaging, if the user of checking does not have authority to access associated electrical form, this object can be made mistakes.Such as, the example of aforementioned copy/paste cell, the access needed for successful execution is the read access (such as getValue is required) to removable electrical form and the write access (such as setValue is required) to target spreadsheet (such as electrical form " MyOtherDoc ").
Script actuator 208 can be responsible for grand establishment context and perform the actual insertion of the packaged service of top layer 210.Can be that each grand execution creates new top layer scope, such as, prevent the possibility of the global scope of other scripts of execution script " murder by poisoning ".Can by realizing class shutter or filtrator loads grand context, class shutter or filtrator prevent from creating any unratified java class (such as, not on the white list allowing class).In addition, script actuator 208 can create the instruction counter for stoping script out of control, when enters infinite loop with detection script.In some implementations, script manager 204 premature discontinuation script out of control can be used.
Script actuator 208 can be responsible for various function, comprises parsing, checks syntax, function call, grand execution and recovery.Analytical capabilities can check script and return the function and grand list that find in the script storage in the data of such as script information data storage 206 store.Such as, referring to Fig. 1, as analytical capabilities result detected by function and Hong Ke comprise and obtain title function 114, check title function 116, obtain function of position 118 and maybe can be embedded in any other function in script or macrocode (such as macrocode 112), grand etc.
Other functions of system support can be used for helping one group of management server end system 200 grand.Such as, before stores scripts, whether syntax audit function can be determined in script wrong (such as syntax error, language compilation's mistake, keyword misuse etc.).If syntax error or other mistakes detected, can communicate this mistake, reminding user or shell script person.
Calling function can " call " (or start perform) grand in function.This calling function can be perform grand limited version, such as authorizes the version of the function call privilege in (in such as electrical form) cell.Such as, grand limited version can be only limitted to rreturn value, and does not allow to create spinoff.
Grand execution and restore funcitons can be used for starting and recovering grand.Such as, grand n-back test can start grand original execution.Under certain situation, grand execution needs the extra input of user.In this case, when waiting for that user carries out inputting, grand execution can be postponed, or enter waiting status.Once after providing user to input, recover macroefficiency and can continue to perform suspended grand.
Script information warehouse 206 can be used as data and store, and provides and/or supports as operations such as script/grand establishment, storage, retrieval, renewal, deletions.The script be stored in script information warehouse 206 can be organized into user library, single script or application (such as, for the application etc. of Email, electrical form, word processing file).Can to whole user library executable operations, or to the individual element executable operations in storehouse.Such as, operation can with the ID retrieval user storehouse (major key such as based on library name is searched) of user library.Another operation can receive all user libraries of given document by search chain, such as, represent document that is grand or script.
The search operaqtion that script information warehouse 206 provides can comprise following operation: retrieve given user to the mandate of given user library, retrieve all user libraries that given user has, continue record etc. with ID retrieval.
Establishment/renewal rewards theory that script information warehouse 206 provides can comprise following operation: create/upgrade user library, the association creating the key word (such as document id) from storehouse to abstract object, the given user of establishment/upgrade to the mandate in given storehouse, create new continuation record (such as with the binary data of the serializing of given user) and storehouse, and other establishment/renewal rewards theory.
The operation that the execution that script information warehouse 206 provides is deleted can comprise following operation: delete continuation record, delete the association from storehouse to abstract object and delete storehouse, remove all subobjects, all subobjects comprise and the subobject of authorizing and link continuation associates.The example logical structure of hereinafter with reference Fig. 5 description script information warehouse 206.
Order can be sent underlying component 206-219 by script manager 204.The description of concrete example command is followed by a series of process processes of label from 1 to 6 marks, and be marked as said process to the controllability path of sending of underlying component 206-219, these labels temporally mark, but when possible, some action can other occur in sequence.
The executable order (such as by sending) of script manager 204 stores user library.Order performs such as limited based on user privilege or other security strategies.Such as, if user library represents that (such as sub-protocol buffers) comprises storehouse ID, script manager 204 can ensure that allowing to perform user revises storehouse.Authorize if existed, so script manager 204 can be write accumulation layer, and returns the new expression in storehouse.If there is no ID, so can create new ID, the expression comprising the new ID produced can be returned.Thesaurus can comprise the function (such as using script actuator 208) of such as resolving in storehouse, increases function to storehouse DAO object, detects syntax error (such as using script actuator 208), thesaurus content and store everyone.Referring to Fig. 2, the part stored involved by user library can such as indicate by process 1,2 and 6.
Such as, sub-protocol buffers be used for that user library can comprise when representing can serializing or the data structure that retains in binary form in database on line.This data structure can use strongly-typed field to enforce communication protocol.
Script manager 204 another order executable is import library.This order can create storehouse to given document (such as electrical form, Email calendar or any other can enclose hereafter) link or other association.Such as, email message can associate with the given mail account of user.The object of link is that bottom document can be distinguished oneself fast and grandly to associate, such as, to show in " RUN " menu with which.Such as, storehouse imports order and can create " link " table clause in data store.Referring to Fig. 2, the part involved by import library such as can indicate by process 1 and 2.
Script manager 204 another order executable is copy command, and this order copies existing storehouse, makes the duplicate of its content.Such as, all scripts that storehouse can be comprised and grand copy to a new library name under.Replication actions makes the duplicate of the content in storehouse, but does not copy association.Everyone of the storehouse newly created is set to current everyone.After replicate run completes, return the ID in new storehouse.Such as, copy command can create new " UserLibrary " table clause in data store, and does not copy any link, continuation or mandate.Referring to Fig. 2, the part copied involved by storehouse such as can indicate by process 1 and 2.
Such as, delete library command and can check authority, if then allowed, this order (such as in script information 206) can delete storehouse from data store.Such as, delete library command and can remove entry from " UserLibrary " form and all sub-table.Front end can be responsible for such as provide any " you determine? " such inquiry.The part of deleting involved by storehouse such as can indicate by process 1 and 2.
The order that user obtains storehouse can return to according to user ID the storehouse that given user has.Such as, order can return preserve in script information 206, user field is user library (such as, in UserLibrary or other forms) entry of active user.Referring to Fig. 2, the part involved by storehouse obtaining user such as can indicate by process 1,2 and 4.
The order obtaining storehouse by document can return to any storehouse that given document imports.Such as, obtain library command can scan " documented " field of mating in Link form and return father " UserLibrary ".Referring to Fig. 2, the part involved by storehouse obtaining document such as can indicate by process 1,2 and 4.。
Class library order can increase association to " virtual " document of such as " sample ".Such as, class library order can create the entry with given title (sample etc.) in Link form.Referring to Fig. 2, the part involved by class library such as can indicate by process 1 and 2.
Obtain class library order and can return to all storehouses with given classification.Such as, obtaining class library order can with to obtain document library order similar.Referring to Fig. 2, such as can be indicated by process 1 and 2 by the part involved by classified search storehouse.
Evaluation function order can from storehouse retrieval functions function passes is performed to script actuator 208.Referring to Fig. 2, the part involved by evaluation function such as can indicate by process 1,2,3,5 and 6.
When providing input parameter (such as storehouse ID, macro name and the contextual information (if exist) about current document) to evaluate macro order, this order can create the wrapped program joint of tool and be performed to script actuator 208 by packaging Service delivery.Referring to Fig. 2, the part involved by evaluate macro such as can indicate by process 1,2,3,5 and 6.
Given macrolibrary ID and when continuing ID, continuing macros can continuation operation on invoke script actuator 208.Such as, the grand continuation activity that this order can make time-out perform performs.Referring to Fig. 2, continue grand involved part and such as can indicate by process 1,2,3 and 6.
Upgrade the entry of one group of mandate in data store that authorization command can upgrade (or increasing) given macrolibrary and given user.Referring to Fig. 2, the part upgraded involved by authorizing such as can indicate by process 1 and 2.In some implementations, " obtaining storehouse " and other orders typically only in the work of script accumulation layer, and can never call script actuator 208.
Referring now to another part of system 200, order servlet216 can make in response to the request from grand controller (the grand controller of such as JavaScript " MacroController.js ") and perform macros.Response can be used as and is redirected and occurs, such as, to be redirected automatically user transparent.In a redirecting technique example, when browser clients is issued to the request of specific URL, redirected rule can be directed to grand server request, such as grand server subsystem 202.The accessible request type of order servlet216 comprises several requests that such as name is called GET_ADMIN_PANEL, SET_SCRIPT etc.
Such as, GET_ADMIN_PANEL request can return the complete HTML of grand management-plane, and grand controller (such as MacroController.js) can insert HTML and close in dialogue.SET_SCRIPT request can send to order servlet216 content for script and user library ID.Order servlet216 can call script manager 204 to create/to upgrade user library, and this can cause and return HTML (such as being generated by GXP) for panel left-hand side (comprising classification and library name).Macrocontroller.js can present HTML in the div (part) of side panel leftward.
GET_SCRIPT can obtain the content for script in given storehouse from script manager, and returns the contents panel (being generated by GXP) for edit script.Macrocontroller.js can be placed in HTML the content div of panel.
IMPORT_LIB asks available import library command calls script manager.Request presents the left-hand side of panel by gxp and is returned to macrocontroller.js.
COPY_LIB request can be similar with IMPORT_LIB order, but use copy command instead of import order.DELETE_LIB request can be similar with IMPORT_LIB, but use delete command, such as, to be returned whole management-plane HTML by gxp.CATEGORIZE_LIB request can be used as " being increased to sample " feature.The same with IMPORT_LIB, CATEGORIZE_LIB available categorical library command invoke script manager the left-hand side returning panel redraw.
The serializing of macro name, storehouse ID and document status can be used to represent (such as current selection etc.) for RUN_MACRO request and invoke script actuator 208 is given grand to perform.If made a mistake, error message is sent back to macrocontroller.js to be shown to user.If user must give grand mandate, message can be sent back to macrocontroller.js to point out user.
It is mutual that grand server subsystem 202 passes through network 224 and application 220 and location server 222.Application 220 can be the application that user adopts user's set 226 and performs, such as, be the web browser that user's notebook computer runs.User's set 226 can indication example as webpage 226a (such as using Spreadsheet server).User network browser can adopt grand controller 226b to control grand execution on the user's set 226 of user.
External event from third party's process and webpage 228 can be used as the grand trigger mechanism defined on grand server subsystem 202.External event can be received by the network 230 as internet.Here external event may correspond in external event 105 described in reference diagram 1.
Except internal event, the external event as the positional information of position receiver 218 reception also can be followed the tracks of by event servlet214 and report.Event servlet214 can realize the event registration table based on server, and it is used as the communication hub of the event occurred in system 200.
Can visit event registration table by process or the subscription process interested to grand associated process that system is run, and when event registration table can provide prompting to these processes thus occur some event, these processes can be instantiated.For this reason, event registration table provides the method can called by event consumer.Event registration table can show various method, such as " monitor (listen) " method, " not monitoring (unlisten) " method and can be used for the additive method of Admin Events.
Monitor method is used as the basis of event-monitoring and tracking in system, can have independent variable and parameter, such as user name, event filter and target.Thus, the format sample that monitor method calls can be as follows:
listen(userName,eventFilter,target)；
Call monitor method can notification event registration table user's (such as by user that " username " identifies) of representing empirical tests go to monitor particular event, and one or more specific objective (such as by the target of " target " parameter identification) will be routed to when there are these events.Such as, particular event can be identified with event filter (such as " eventFilter " parameter).Event filter can comprise service identifier (such as E-mail service, calendar service etc.) and other serve distinctive filtrator (such as " Email Recipient ", " file establishment " etc.).Target can be such as remote procedure call (RPC) clawback.Such as, when occurring or occur event, event registration table can send to this end points (such as target) event details.In some implementations, target can be the parts of grand server subsystem 202, and it has when identified event triggers to run which grand identifier.
Corresponding " not monitoring " method can be used for the request cancelling the notice receiving pertinent events.The form of calling calling not monitor method can be as follows:
unlisten(userName,eventFilter,target)；
Call not monitor method can be equivalent to cancellation or stop " audiomonitor ".Similarly, the parameter of this order is contrary with the parameter started most for starting to monitor event.
Event servlet214 application compound event condition can also be passed through.Such as, event filter can be defined thus the only just trigger notice when the Email arrived arrives and the sender of Email or addressee are positioned at certain position.This compound standard can with independent grand realization, and such as, by so grand realization, this grand arrival by Email and triggering, then checks that location-based service is to obtain the position of addressee or sender, only just continue execution when position and special values match.Standard also realizes by event servlet214, such as, by providing the executable process of servlet214, thus notice subscription service start to perform grand before collection information to determine whether to meet compound condition.
In some cases, event condition can combine with one another, as employing cascade or series system.Such as, event occurs that sending message by event servlet214 triggers grand startup to script manager 204.Then, this grandly runs and provides the output relating to other events defined by event servlet214.Responsively, event servlet214 can send another message to script manager 204, different grand to make script manager 204 start.Use similar fashion, individual event can trigger the grand execution of two differences simultaneously.Such as, user may wish to run in response to user account receives any Email one grand (such as, extract heading message from Email and this information put into electrical form), but also wish receiving in from social networking system (can independent of the system of operational subsystems 202 and tissue) any moment of being defined as the mail of the user of the good friend of first user and running when this good friend is positioned at the specific range of first user that another is grand.Thus, from this good friend of this position Email arrive time, can trigger concurrently simultaneously and perform two grand.
Available several different modes starts event notice.Such as, program can be utilized to start event notice.In some implementations, can create " erector " script or other program codes, it utilizes program registered events type in event registration table.Such as, the application of package tracking in enterprise can dispose or initial install time in mail tabulation registered events audiomonitor, it exercisablely arrives to notify that client wraps up, wrap up and send, received freight charges, goods and arrived X place etc.Then, when activity being detected in mail tabulation, can other actions automatically in Run Script storehouse (such as package tracking script bank).In this example utilizing program to start, seldom need, even intervene to come " foundation " event sniffer without the need to terminal user, this is owing to establishing monitoring in advance, such as, as the part that package tracking application is installed.In some implementations, other user interface can be provided to adjust audiomonitor or to define new audiomonitor.
Start in another example mechanism of event notice, provide the intended application of event to create and show that the interface of oneself calls binding to allow user event type and particular script.Such as, some e-mail applications (Mail.app of such as apple) can use the adoptable custom filter of user, such as, specify when there is particular event and run certain application (such as AppleScript).Other application (such as Gmail etc.) can comprise allow user define email attributes criterion (such as comprise the Email of character string ABC, Email from/send to particular address etc.) and the filtrator of action (such as, email archives, add mark to mail, be transmitted to address XYZ etc.) that is performed.Similarly, Gmail can allow user selectively to increase such as " Run Script XYZ " as one of action that will perform when meeting certain filter criterion.Other application can use similar characteristics, such as, change notification service in Google electrical form, and it is exercisable with the Email (to user) sending the summary that related electronic form changes.In some implementations, substitute and send mail, or except sending mail, other options of call macro can also be provided.
The additive method of target also having Admin Events, user and user account, event filter and associate with event registration table.Such as, user can use getRegisteredListenersForUser method to obtain the information (such as its audiomonitor list) relevant with all events that its account is monitored at present.Such as can show this information at management-plane or other user interfaces.Other event management methods can comprise to specific usernames, and event filter or target or its combination provide the method for information.
The event registration table that event servlet214 realizes can the right database of maintenance customer/audiomonitor.When receiving " monitoring " method or order, such as event registration table can be untied service filter and send message to the service of correspondence.
Available similar " monitoring " method comprising user certificate and event filter of each service shows RPC end points.The target of service can be event registration table self.Such as, serve when inside detects that condition meets event filter, this service can send event to event registration table.This part of this process (by each server) is inner to be realized leaving particular server for and is responsible for, thus does not need any specific internal asking this part of system to realize.Thus, the mode that event broadcast device can be applicable to oneself realizes this contract.
During event registration table registration (or detecting) event, event registration table is responsible for from its data store, untiing target information and event notice being sent to all related objectives.Notice can comprise any other relevant information that the mark of event self and target may need.In some implementations, main target can be grand server subsystem 202.In some implementations, other targets can be used, such as comprise notification service, log services, network service and other.
In some implementations, system can be designed to consider decoupling zero each other (decoupling) to the design of different piece.Such as, event registration table can know target, and event broadcast service is not then known.In addition, event broadcast service can know how application affairs filtrator (such as " mail sends ", " electronic form unit grid upgrades ", " project is placed in file "), and event registration table is not then known.Such as, event registration table only can know how positioning service end points (such as target).The available benefit of this Decoupling design is, allows following participant (as third party) freely realize their system end and do not need to worry the Routing details to N number of possibility target.
Relevant transmission mechanism, implementation can use any suitable mechanism for API Calls, the network transmission protocol etc.Such as, some third party participants of event registration table can use various network service (such as " SOAP ") for many outside API Calls.Other participants can use expression state to shift (REST) or other suitable API.Proprietary network host-host protocol can be used in inside as provided other participants of the tissue of subsystem 202.Each or the mechanism herein do not enumerated in these mechanism can preserve content and the semanteme of flow of event.
In some implementations, the method for user authentication such as can comprise OAuth or for allowing any other suitable open standard of the user data in an application access Another Application.Such as, access can be allowed without the need to user provides password or other concrete certificates.Specifically, when using OAuth or similar approach, user can allow event registration table to call Event Subsystem in various application of opening.Call and can use the discernible token of each service.As a result, certification can be limited to event system, and such as, other services of disable access simultaneously, such as representative of consumer sends Email (such as without user's license etc.).
The content (or " event data ") of each event can comprise such as one group of attribute/value pair.Such as, can be one group of general standard attribute of all application definitions (such as " user " and " service ").In addition, each application definable its serve proprietary additional attribute.Such as, spreadsheet application definable attribute " electronic form unit grid ", this attribute is useless to non-electronic form application.
In some implementations, some or all of filtrator can appear in event registration table, instead of is only participating in service or mixedly appearing between the two.In this case, the service of participation can not add and pushes away to event registration table by all events with distinguishing, the audiomonitor that event registration table can store based on it performs event filtering.Although the filtration based on registration table can simplify or eliminate the filtration of the service of participation, under certain situation, this method can make system supersaturation.
Here, system also can allow the following record macro of user: instantiation macro-recorder, perform multiple action that macro-recorder follows the tracks of and preserve the expression of these actions, can carry out calling this expression to automatically perform this action after user.In this implementation, typical case carries out grand record at server end.User perform can record order time (such as, setup unit scale value, insert worksheet etc.), order can be sent to Spreadsheet server.This server can note oneself whether being in " record " pattern, be, server can look-up command write text in the operation string buffer corresponding with the scripted code with effect same.
Such as, if consider that user knocks in " hello " in the cell A1 of electrical form.Can send order to Spreadsheet server, order ID is meant to " setting range ", and be worth for " hello ", behavior 0, is classified as 0, and worksheet ID is 0 (such as, if first page worksheet).Note, this is not only to register; This is the actual order carrying out changing cell on Spreadsheet server, thus whether occurs that record all will send this order.Thus, register is equal to the wiretap carried out on the established command stream of spreadsheet operations substantially.
Register can look-up command ID and find this be " setting range " order.Register knows that the correct code that will produce calls " scope " object " setValue ", and thus register can be searched and use row and column to produce corresponding text.Then, register is searched and is used worksheet identifier, determines whether the variable of this worksheet exists.As a result, macro-recorder can produce following text:
sheet.getRange('a1').setValue('hello')；(2)
Thus, by these structures, computer user can sign in trustship Computer Service and access multiple different application and service.User can select to perform grand clearly, or can automatically trigger grand, if grand can in this application and other related application can be run in these other related application of instantiation automatically by macro reference.As a result, the data that user-accessible is a large amount of and programming mechanism are to produce stable online service.
Fig. 3 A is the process flow diagram for performing grand process 300 on trustship computing system.Process 300 is such as used in run macro in system 100 and 200.Generally speaking, shown process comprises the relevant macrocode of identification, establishment object is mutual with the one or more application in run time version and run time version and trustship computer system.
Process 300 in this example, from frame 302, receives the order of run macro at this.Order can be the result of external event 105 described with reference to FIG. 1, or user can manually select to run grand.Such as, under the previous case, external event 105 can be receive Email, orders grand can being in response to that will run to receive the grand of Email executable operations, such as, upgrade electrical form with the header line of Email.Grand hook 104 can participate in detecting external event 105, then, is also responsible for triggering will run grand, such as, by communicating with grand server subsystem 106.
At frame 304, identify, retrieve and perform macrocode.Such as, referring to Fig. 2, script manager 204 can identify the macrocode that will perform to script information 206.Then, script information 206 can return asked macrocode to script manager 204, and then, script manager 204 can start macrocode and perform.
As the part performing macrocode, (at frame 306) creates has the example of representative for the Java object of the programming API of grand application mutual with it.API may correspond in macrocode application mutual with it.Such as, if macrocode is designed for renewal electrical form, the example so created comprises the Java object of representative for the programming API of respective electronic form application.
Frame 308 object encapsulation in safety packaging.Such as, safety packaging can be the additional code around macrocode self, such as, takes affirmative action otherwise just do not allow macrocode to run except non-user.In some implementations, action can be click " OK ", or clearly permits some grand other modes.
Safety packaging can protect terminal user in every way, such as from Trojan horse attack, from phishing attacks and the attack exempting from other malicious codes.In some implementations, safety packaging can be built after sending dialog box to user.The message that dialog box comprises can grand may not trust grand of being identified as, and if identify run macro what can occur further.In some implementations, dialog box can identify this grand distinctive may dangerous act list, this list is based on to grand scanning.Such as, scan grand contribute to part based on the text-string in grand or corresponding some other information identifications of the content grand with the malice in past concrete may endanger effect.
User can agree to or not agree to the grand access that may have.User agrees to can be used for building capability-based safety packaging mentioned above, such as allow grand have read privilege, but do not allow some file of grand renewal.In this case, subscriber authorisation grand, the privilege of reacting in safety packaging or authority be limited to the action of those types of user's approval.
In some implementations, the process for generation of safety packaging can detect the malicious code attempting the mechanism misleading detection of malicious code.Such as, not use " delete " in macrocode, connexon character string " de " and " lete " (such as " delete ") can be intended to attempt hiding real deletion action.Process described herein can be programmed to identify this situation and prevent user not to grand authorize erase right time deletion.
At frame 310, the associated server of each application that call macro is directed to.Call to relate to performing and comprise and grand the mutual method of association or the object of other program API.Such as, the macrocode that can comprise and perform and upgrade electrical form, Forwarding Email, xcopy etc. is called.
Then (at frame 312) carries out mutual also access services by the feedback from each application.Such as, the user interactions with the grand application just operated can be comprised alternately.Such as, user is readable due to the grand Email (and performing with other of mail mutual) just received from another user's Forwarding Email.
Like this, can across the independent particle system in center system runs multiple be applied in center system performs grand.Grandly comprise security mechanism, and available various ways triggers.In addition, grandly can obtain information from multiple different service, or these differences can be accessed by the such as network of internet from other system in system and serve.
Fig. 3 B is the process flow diagram triggering grand process for Admin Events.Generally speaking, this process comprises two stages: in the first stage, entity subscribes event registration table obtains the notice with the event of some matches criteria after showing to wish, event occurs in subordinate phase and event registration table notifies suitable entity.These two stages can occur by basic continous during the course, and entity carries out registering new subscription, the event of subscription that other entities are notified simultaneously about registering before sensing.
This process is from frame 320, and the notice of event of will subscribing to received by event registration table from entity here.Notice can arrive in a variety of forms, and such as form is the remote procedure call between application (script manager 204 in such as Fig. 2) for managing grand execution and event registration table.As mentioned above, notice can comprise user name, event filter and target.User name may correspond to the identifier of the user account in the trustship computer system of Action Events registration table, target can represent the address (such as URL) that will send notice when event registration table recognizes trigger event to it, one or more conditions that before event filter can represent and provide notice to target, event must meet.There is provided the entity of notice can be any number of entity, comprise script manager 204, script manager 204 user establish will by can provide during specific events trigger grand comprise be directed to specific grand target inform event registration table, like this, can run macro when there is event.
At frame 322, registration table for registering is subscribed to entity and is preserved the notifying parameters of event.Registration can comprise the information of relating to parameters of preserving and receiving in the notification, and can comprise these information associates with the registered user of system, thus the user-accessible information that also change is relevant with event registration table clause.Remaining information can be kept at and be easy to as event registration table position used, like this, can search for remaining information to determine particular event with which entry associates when there is event.
Under certain situation, event registration table can subscribe to the service of the event generation associated with the entry in registration table.Such as, event registration table can provide user ID to the application based on server of such as e-mail applications, tell this application it should report certain class event relevant to specific user's account.Such as, event registration table can the event of giving the message of user John Duo Yi relevant of informing E-mail application report and arrival.Like this, application can know when reporting event, and is supplied to event registration table without the need to all events run into.
The subordinate phase of process is from frame 326, and here, the service reception that event registration table produces from event is to notice.Such as, what e-mail applications can arrive indicates event to the form of the Email of specific user.Instruction may simply be the form of the identification number that event registration table provides when subscribing to e-mail applications, and event registration table can use this number to search in bottom registration and require which notifies.Also can transmit other information, the information such as defined during original licensed, and event registration table can pass to subscription entity as script manager 204 this information, thus event trigger perform grand can easily visit information.Alternatively, grand being programmed to independently directly obtains information from application.Event registration table can be in listen mode always, waits for this notice, and can process the many this kind of notice from many services substantially simultaneously, and, notice can be reported to many differences and subscribe to entity, comprising grand or grand management service.
At frame 328, event registration table testing needle is to the notice of all subscription of registration table.When notice is single identification number, event registration table can perform and search, and this is searched and above-mentioned number data record with the information comprised as subscribing to entity and be originally supplied to the information of event registration table is associated.Then, this information (such as destination address) can be used to notify to subscribe to entity (frame 350).
Like this, this process can provide automatically to user easily and perform grand mechanism independent of client devices or User Status (whether such as user is current can be mutual with mandatory system, and user is current whether sign in system).
Fig. 4 A is the process flow diagram of the grand process 400 for performing the application call run from webpage.Generally speaking, shown in Fig. 4 A, shown in process and Fig. 3 A, process is similar, and illustrate can between the different parts of multiple component system the example of the mode of shared procedure.
Instantiation procedure 400 comprises corresponding to the mutual step between browser 401a and grand server 401b.Such as, the user that can relate to the client devices adopting operation spreadsheet application alternately of the browser end of process, and in the grand data server system that may operate at as grand server 401b performed (and obtaining data with it).Process 400 step shown in browser end be can occur between user and spreadsheet application (such as being provided by Spreadsheet server system), with grand irrelevant common mutual beyond step.The step of the process 400 that grand server end performs can such as be performed by grand server subsystem 202.Process 400 also can represent the grand execution in above-mentioned reference diagram 1 and the system described in Fig. 2 100 and 200.Generally speaking, grand server 401b holds the step Available scripts manager 204 of process 400 to control.
At frame 402, occur performing grand request.Such as, request can from the user of running browser application on a client device.User can execute key combination to trigger grand operation, or can startup optimization as follows: open in the application control in particular document, user's selective gist or by except user and system mutual except mechanism (as received external signal by subsystem).
In step 404, start grand execution.Such as, startup can appear in grand server subsystem 202.Such as, the macrocode corresponding to address transmitted by client devices or identify can be loaded on subsystem, and this macrocode can start to perform in normal way.
Determine whether user provides in step 406 and perform grand mandate.This action can appear at the beginning that macrocode performs.Such as, subscriber authorisation can be the part practice preventing malicious code from running as mentioned above.
If there is no subscriber authorisation, so obtain subscriber authorisation requirement in step 410, point out in step 412 and point out mandate to user.If user provides mandate in step 414, preserve subscriber authorisation in step 416, otherwise process 400 terminates in step 418.If subscriber authorisation requires the list that can comprise the malice result type such as allowing grand execution there will be.In step 412, list can be presented to user.
If there is subscriber authorisation, create packaging service in step 408.Can with such as pack the service-creation device 212 establishment service of packing (or " bean ").This action is optional, can be used for protecting the code performed from above-mentioned malicious interference.
In step 420, in script actuator, perform script (or grand).Such as, referring to Fig. 2, Available scripts actuator 208 performs script.Such as, different with the grand execution occurred in client computer this locality, perform and appear in grand server subsystem 202.Script performs and can carry out in normal way, progressively performs the step in script and carry out its action when meeting each step with a part of subsystem.
Determine whether to run into continuation in step 422.If run into continuation, store in step 428 and continue.Continuation can in fact for suspending script until special time or occur particular event.If do not run into continuation, in step 424 Recovery processing, here, determine whether to run into and make mistakes.Make mistakes if do not run into, successfully terminate grand execution in step 430.Make mistakes if run in step 424, in step 426 reminding user, then terminate grand execution in step 430.
Thus, utilize this process, can provide to user the grand function provided triggered by the action of user on client devices (or other events), and grandly can to perform independent of on the subsystem of client devices.Under certain situation, can perform when user is not online, the result of grand execution can be user and can use other users of system registry.
Continue " snapshot " of the executing state that can be used as script interpreter, freeze to perform thus can recover after a while to perform.In concept this and debugger interrupt point how class of operation seemingly, or call similar with " prompting " that standard browser end performs in (such as JavaScript).Continuation can realize with the pointer of the Binary Serialization of all objects in interpreter (such as all local variables and " bean ") and sensing current execution point.Can realize continuing in script actuator 208, this script actuator 208 can support the continuation as public available feature.Java serializing (this is the standard feature of Java) such as can be used to carry out all objects of serializing (such as comprising " bean ") by script actuator 208.Use Java serializing, object (and all subobjects) can be written out to the binary stream of the currency comprising object identifier and all fields.When recovering grand, can give script actuator 208 and continue binary data, these data such as can be used for new active Java object when solution sequence.
In some implementations, continuation can store in a database.Such as continue to store in a database instead of in server memory until recover grand.A reason of database purchase can be due to server can trigger continue time and user recover to perform between moment (such as by click " ok " button in dialog box or some recover actions) restart.In some implementations, continuation can have predetermined life cycle (such as six hours), after this, can abandon continuation.Like this, continuation never can not be found time click " ok " button as user and be continued to occupy disk space.
Fig. 4 B is for recording on mandatory system and performing the swimming lane process flow diagram of grand process 431.Instantiation procedure 431 comprise browser, macro-recorder, grand server and application between mutual.Generally speaking, this process provides one group of grand record control from server subsystem to user, user can utilize control to indicate the action when needing recording user and system to carry out thus, then, these actions can be reformatted as grand code, re-execute these actions when call macro.
Process is from frame 432, and here, user selects macro-recorder.Selection can occur in a browser, such as, when user selects control to start record macro.Macro-recorder service is provided in step 434.Macro-recorder can perform on user browser, or macro-recorder can long-distance support, such as, perform on grand server subsystem 202.Such as can show macro-recorder in the Rimless browser window of window departing from current display application on user's client devices.Also otherwise register can be provided, such as, as iFrame or the analogous element of same one page part of display application.
In step 436, with application display macro-recorder.Such as, if perform spreadsheet application in the browser of user on its notebook computer, can occur that ejection or other displays represent macro-recorder.Macro-recorder can be shown as has the various control for controlling register operation, such as at user option record, time-out and stop button.Start record in step 438, mean that user can start to strike the key of defmacro.This record can by the message trigger providing the server subsystem of service to send for register to the code by showing register, and indicating user have selected the record control on register.
In step 440, user is mutual with application, is meant to user and performs the functional operation of defmacro in the application used user (stroke, selection etc.).Such as, user can select the cell of certain scope in electrical form, can on these cells fill order (such as, to copy and paste cell, input formula etc. in cell), and other this actions can be performed.
In step 442, at user and application interaction, macro-recorder starts recording user action, and this can be included in recording process display command while user record order.As mentioned above, register can input with applying interpreting user in the same manner, the grand order that operationally can be supplied to application after then these actions through explanation being converted to.Register also can follow the tracks of user's exectorial application wherein (such as browser window), like this, grand know its operationally order be supplied to those different multiple application.
When user and the mutual and operation of recording of application, the standard of user action is provided to perform in step 444.Can perform in the mutual with it application of user.Thus, concurrently user action can be supplied to application and macro-recorder, like this, have recorded action, and application is reacted to action in a suitable manner like this.
After completing grand definition, receive hold-over command from user, such as, by pressing " stopping " button of register, " completing " key or other controls.In step 448, send grand information.This information can be construed as macros when user's fill order records, or can make an explanation after grand record stops and changing.Then, macro-recorder is sent out and information is such as sent to grand storage, and can produce and point to one or more pointers (such as URL) of macrocode, later like this can easily fetcher code.Such as, for starting grand key combination after macro-recorder can require user to identify.
In step 450, preserve grand information, this comprise library name (preserving grand storehouse), script or grand content (as macro-recorder record) and user ID.Also can suitably preserve and grand other relevant information.
After, after being no matter a moment or several days even after several years, when user determines run macro, user can specify will run grand.Such as can by selecting macro name to complete grand selection from the grand list for the current application definition mutual with it of user.Such as, the grand list of user-accessible can with user account stored in association, and list can be shown to user's (each grand fabricator provides intelligible title for grand).Alternatively, can automatically select grand, such as by performing, another is grand, by system occurring the event irrelevant with the action of specific user or otherwise.User also can allow other users use the grand of preservation, such as, wish to have the e-mail address to other users of grand access rights or other account identifier by being prompted first user.User can also provide one group of other user, such as, by all users (such as, from all users of employer's user access system) of refer message group (such as email list) or special domain or subdomain.
Such as, alternatively, can receive such as from the input of the run macro of user in step 452a.Alternatively, the trigger event of run macro can be there is in step 452b.Utilize two kinds of machine-processed any one, receive in step 454 and perform and the macrocode of grand correspondence.
In the starting stage of grand execution, be correspond to create object with the API of the grand application associated in step 456.These objects can represent and perform grand required object, and can comprise such as order being become the object of another kind of form from a kind of format conversion, packing the object of other objects, limit applies object and other this kind of objects.
Step 458 object encapsulation in safety packaging.The available above-mentioned mechanism of this packaging is carried out, and can be used for protection user and avoids performing malicious code in system.
In step 460, call (or carry out or perform) application by user ID.Available grand server subsystem 202 performs application call.Call and comprise user ID to check mandate, such as guarantee user through authorize readable, upgrade or delete specific file etc.
In step 462, perform the action relevant to the step that will perform in the application of calling.Such as, action may correspond to single instruction in recorded grand middle record or step.Step performs carries out in the application, applied physics can be positioned at the position that the browser of record macro is long-range.In fact, in some examples, grandly may be recorded on different browsers by diverse user and preserve.In this case, different user may be use grand good friend or kinsfolk by the subscriber authorisation that raw readings is grand.
In step 464, return the key needed for performing further.These keys such as can comprise the input that user provides or the parameter applying self transmission." key " that return from intended application (such as spreadsheet application) can identify any project that its state changes due to given order.Such as, order INSERT_SHEET that new worksheet can be made to become " current " worksheet.Grand have other orders (such as getActiveSheet) that can be used for reflecting current new sheet.Other orders (such as INSERT_ROW) can change current selection, and changing which cell is current active cell.And data can be selected to return to grand storage current state, need this information in order to subsequent commands (such as getActiveSheet).
Step 460,462,464 can continue relatively to run simultaneously, completes until grand.Terminate to appear at step 462 when running into and perform final injunction, or when grand executory event Stop Macro performs.
Fig. 5 illustrates the exemplary construction of object in macrosystem, specifically, the logical organization of the information as the structure in the script information warehouse 206 of Fig. 2 is shown.Logical organization 500 node 502 to 508 represents.Grand for any one storage in script information warehouse 206, such as, at least there is a structure 500 or its part.Continue node 504, hinged node 506/ and subscriber authorisation node 508 and all with user library node 502, there is 0..N relation, be meant to for each user library (or head) node, any number of (comprising zero) continuation, link and subscriber authorisation can be there is.
The root node of structure is user library node 502, the title (" Macro_XYZ " in such as " the red MacroLib based on cloud ") in its definition such as grand and/or storehouse, the macrolibrary owner (such as " pellet ") and with the grand script (such as macrocode) associated.Each macrolibrary can have unique identifier, such as the pseudo random number of 64, and this identifier also can be used as database key.In some implementations, when retrieving grand from database, do not use the field of the one group of function comprised as library name and storehouse; These fields be strictly for running/show macrolibrary." owner " field such as can be used as the external key of the operation had as " obtaining all grand of user XYZ ".Chained list such as can be used for the operation as " obtaining all grand of document XYZ use ".
Continue node 504 can comprise and continue ID, continue data (such as from other entrance, such as, for grand enter waiting status after recover grand with other input) and user name (such as create and continue the user of node 504).Given grandly exist multiple continuation node 504." owner " that can record continuation is mainly used in preventing Session Hijack, thus such as user X can not as user Y resume operation grand.Like this, operation can ensure to only have user Y to recover that he starts is grand.Can allow multiple this record, this is because a user can have multiple continuation (three electrical forms opened in such as different windows, each prompted dialog frame with activity).Multiple user also can run themselves grand example, each dialog prompt with oneself simultaneously.
It is grand that hinged node 504 allows external entity to be linked to.Hinged node 504 can comprise document id, and it can be grand some other pathnames of URL or " sensing ".Grandly multiple different names (and to this grand multiple different URL path or other paths) can be had, so multiple hinged node 506 can be there is due to same.
Subscriber authorisation node 508 can comprise the information allowed grand limiting access.Such as, restriction sub-protocol buffers (protobuffer) field can the protocol mode access control of use value, and user field can based on user ID access control.Can be used any one in each node 508 or both use.Given grandly have multiple subscriber authorisation node 508, the authorization mechanism that each node identification is different.Subscriber authorisation node 508 can only have an authority record for each grand each user by mandatory requirement.Mandatory requirement can adopt user to be used for performing the such expression of the approval seal of the grand and grand thing done.Can allow multiple record, such sole cause is that each of multiple different user may have grand mandate, and performs different actions to each subscriber authorisation.When user X performs grand, use his grand authority record, ignore every other record.
If grand requirement changes (if such as author adds calling blog applications), this can change the requirement needed for run macro, and so existing subscriber authorisation can be marked as inefficacy.Like this, when after adding extra requirement, user attempts to perform grand again, can reresent user needs to authorize.Such as, prompting can be " this grand need access calendar and blog applications ", and grandly before only to say " this grand require access calendar ".If delete service, do not need prompting again to authorize, just point out when only having requirement to increase.
Fig. 6 illustrates the illustrative screenshot of grand constructing system 600.Such as, user can use this system to establish macroparameter Sum fanction, grandly subsequently can perform based on external event, or manually can perform when user selects.Generally speaking, system is organized into three phases macrostructure, and row of each stage screenshotss illustrate, and each stage (comprising the sub in each stage) can with phasic change before being configured.Use this system, user can identify grand trigger, identifying operation is grand from the available parameter relevant with selected trigger parameter fast and correspond to the grand result of selected parameter.
In an example, user can build and perform the grand of e-mail function based on Email dependent event.In another example, can be built in relevant application (such as electrical form, the text processing application etc.) executable operations of non-email grand.In another example, but user can build to have and exports do not depend on the grand of any trigger event.No matter as the type of the application of trigger or output, on screen, make user simply select just automatically to produce corresponding grand structure.The software application that screen " below " runs such as can process the user's input on the interface shown in Fig. 6 screenshotss and select, and can automatically build grand, comprise and insert suitable grand syntax, various application is proprietary or language is proprietary API Calls and other the grand parts needed for run macro.All these is to user transparent, and user inputs several input simply in several intelligible field.
Screenshotss 600 comprise macro name field 601, its mark current constructed grand (that such as, define at first as user or later renewal).As mentioned above, macro definition can be carried out three normal areas: grand trigger data region 602, grand process data area 604 and grand output data area 606.Grand trigger data region 602 can comprise user and can be used for determining and identify the field and control that trigger grand conditioned disjunction event.Grand process data area 604 can be used for the process that can occur when defmacro runs.The grand output of grand output data area 606 identifiable design, such as grand in the application data type of operation and the action (or operation) taked data.Other data defined ranges except the 602-606 of data area can be there are, such as, if same grand needs upgrades the data in multiple application, multiple grand output data area 606 can be had.In some implementations, can use and submit/return technology to, to ensure to have carried out all renewals, or without any renewal, this contributes to keeping data integrity.
Three data areas 602,604 and 606 can be designed to complete in order usually.In some implementations, user can affect below this region or display on the field on the right or control a regioselective value.Such as, in grand trigger data region 602, the data of input can affect field and the data selection type of display (and user can select) in other regions (such as data area 604 and 606).Such as, if user selects " Email " as grand trigger mechanism (such as, by specifying in attribute field 608 or selecting " Email "), option available in so grand process data area 604 can customize for email attributes.
As the example illustrated, grand trigger data region 602 comprises attribute field 608, action field 610, parameter field 611.The user that in action field 610, the value of display (and can be selected by user) can be depending in attribute field 608 selects.Such as, by selecting " Email " in attribute field 608, the value in action field 610 comprises the option (such as arrive message, inbox size, tag size etc.) relevant with Email.Selection different attribute (such as auctioning online) can cause the different item lists (such as amount of commodity, taxonomy of goods etc.) in action field 610.Parameter field 611 can be used for activity apportioning cost.The probable value that user can input or select in parameter field 611 can comprise, such as: size, color, U.S. dollar amount, time period, language, sex or only about any qualitative or quantitative value being suitable for application-specific.In some implementations, the label on parameter field 611 can according to the value automatic marking of activity box 610 (such as size, color, price etc.).
Grand process data area 604 comprises condition field 612, checks service field 614 and service value field 616.Condition field 612 shows the option for identifying the condition that can trigger grand some action (such as forwarding the Email of arrival in some way).The occurrence (such as " from user " or " user from group " etc.) that condition field 612 shows can be depending on user's entry (such as Email) of such as attribute field 608.If user selects different values (such as electrical form) at attribute field 608, in condition field 612, a different set of value (such as relevant with electrical form) can be shown.
Check service field 614 can collect for the information of run macro in identify by the grand of grand inspection and the outside service of application.Such as, by selecting to check " steady arm " in service field 614, when grand execution, user can just in the position of the specific user that defmacro should check the position of sender, the ranks of making a copy for of the position of user X or Email go out, or other are selected.Which particular value is service value field 616 mark will return to grand from mentioned service.Such as, in this example, position can based on the position of GPS location, cell phone triangulation tracking during approximate real, street address, postcode or any other suitable localization criteria.
In some implementations, grand process data area 604 can comprise for the various mechanism at grand middle use Boolean operator.These mechanism can be condition field 612 "AND" check service field 614 mechanism outside the "AND" that implies.Such as, condition field 612 can use in conjunction with one group of Any/All (any/all) control 617 being shown as radio button, and this can contribute to clearly specifying and/or operational symbol and logic.Such as, user can select " Any " (or " All ") of Any/All control 617, to specify grand any (or all) single options will considering to check in service field 614 on hook.
In some implementations, other boolean's control and field etc. can be provided for other fields on grand constructing system 600, the bracket that the direct Text Input of such as field name, field value, Boolean operator and position are appropriate.This kind of more senior control can comprise such as by the screen display of selecting senior boolean's control 618 to obtain or other interfaces.In some implementations, access senior boolean's control 618 and user can be allowed to see whole grand existing logic, and the current logic representated by input that the user that such as upgrades selects and carry out in data area 602 to 606 can be comprised.System 600 can perform automatic syntax inspection and the field of authentication of users input (or selecting from list) is consistent with the value of inspection.
Grand output data area 606 comprises attribute field 620, action field 622 and parameter field 624.These fields such as can be used to specify grand specific output (such as do this, send that, upgrade specific file, field or electronic form unit grid).In Fig. 6 example shown, attribute 620 have selected " Email ", makes the entry that display is relevant with Email in action field 622.Thus, this grand output can be that the Email of certain form is sent to certain or some addresses.
When needing (such as base selection thereon and field), parameter field 624 can be used for field or selects apportioning cost.In some implementations, can in the value of field " rear " define field, like this, double-click field name and can show pop-up window for defined word segment value, or hovering can the currency of display field in field.
In the grand structure screen of example shown in Fig. 6, grand trigger data region 602 is defined as triggers grand for receiving " during arrival message " (such as being identified by action field 610) in e-mail applications (such as by attribute field 608).Grand process data area 604 comprises appointment particular user, comprises concrete word and the condition 612 based on the position of user X at Email Body.The value of these conditions can be defined in such as other parameter fields (Fig. 6 is not shown).Thus, if met, these conditions are grand can have been performed.Grand output data area 606 illustrates that " Email " is the type of current grand output, and the action that perform is " sending out text message to me " (such as action field 622 define).As the result of the value of input in data area 602 to 606, detect and comprise certain words from specific user, header line and after this trigger event of arrival email message based on the position of user X, grand use message transmits application and sends the target that text message is given to Email, notifies that they have received such Email.The benefit of example grand structure screen is that it provides this message with simple and clear GUI form to user, and the bottom simultaneously concealing n-back test is grand, user even do not need to know how to write grand or how to organize one grand.This screen can be used for building complete grand or build a grand part, wherein user's other codes that can not be able to provide to grand increase screen.
User interface for defmacro can comprise button or control 626, such as, " preservation " input or upgrade grand, " cancelling " is to grand one or more renewal or change, " display " gained grand or do not preserve and " cancellation " edits." copyfrom (copy from) " field 628 can allow user to pass through to copy existing grand and create and define new grand, or is the existing grand parameter that copies, and screen is preset into original state, user can change this state subsequently.The object that description field 630 can allow user record grand, or provide the meaning of macro name some rank not to be covered to grand.
In some implementations, macro definition can have associated time element, the time that such as date of expiration 632 came into force for illustration of grand first time, the termination date 634 illustrates the grand time no longer performed, and scheduling or " runon (running on) " field 636 can be used for the grand date (working day, Monday, weekend etc.) that will perform such as is described.Date field can comprise exact date or date range and/or time, or can comprise enumeration type (such as now, never, working day etc.).
In some implementations, the user interface that system 600 provides can be suitable for performing on the subscriber equipment that display screen is less, such as smart phone etc.Such as, data area 602 to 606 and other fields can be sequentially provided.In some implementations, can be whole plane and scroll bar is provided, allow user once to navigate to an approximate region.
The grand use together with the secure context described in 200 and Fig. 1 with Fig. 2 in conjunction with upper plane system 100 of use system 600 structure.Specifically, the grand of each structure is packaged in capability-based safety packaging.System 600 can comprise can assist safe, with security-related field (not shown), such as comprise may use the name of other grand users and they can the degree (such as send Email, upgrade electrical form etc.) of executable operations.
This capability-based safety by perform to user code authorization time consider user intention and bring benefit.In this system, such as, perform the object that user creates the ability that is called, these object encapsulation user wishes each operation allowed, and these object transfers is given the distrust code that will perform.When system performs and distrusts code, these objects become a part (part of such as packing) for load, and can not by distrust code revision or establishment.When distrusting that trusted resource (being such as generally system file etc.) of accessing bottom attempted by code, the object having packed trusted resource that it can only be created by user carries out.Ability can allow to distrust that the access rights of code carry out fine-grained control to authorizing, and can be used for building the execution environment of adhering to principle of least privilege.This means that any given module can only perform it and can realize the necessary minimum action of oneself function, and can not do more.
Describe about trustship is based on after the example system of grand system and process, paragraph below describes a series of examples for using these systems and process, how many example discussing systems use capability-based safety to process each situation of these situations, and, how to reduce some risks of the part as this example.
Example 1: sales tactics is implemented
Consider that a sales department organized creates to the situation of the motion of potential customers in electrical form.Electrical form comprises all products of company's production and the price of distinguishing products.When sales force browses worksheet, can be effective or invalid (namely current whether can sell) indicating distinguishing products with 1 or 0 in hurdle, distinguishing products side one.Worksheet can comprise the formula for calculation and quotation, comprises various discount and price value-added items.
Such as, have many correlativitys between the single product comprising some features of mutual exclusion.These rule lists can be shown as grand.Alternatively, can represent rule with rule language, rule language can be compiled into and invest the grand in code fo practice of worksheet.Other rules can comprise bug check and other consistency checks.In addition, also have and sales promotion or the rule that associates based on the trigger event of region or other factors.
The something of these rules relevant considered how to manage these rules.Such as, it is useful that grand and/or rule is in the shared library that worksheet quotes, and like this, keeper can value easily more in new sheet.And, the grand part that should be system manager and be supplied to the suite of tools of each small business owner, and these users each can be allowed to access and perform grand.Keeper can upgrade from the middle position mandatory system grand, and user can perform grand from this position.
Thus, available shared model is issued grand, gives each electrical form one " position (slot) " that access is grand.Another user points to grand URL and in the electrical form of grand importing at oneself by comprising at his electrical form, and can authorize the grand authority write to this electrical form.
Example 2: investment user interface
Consider situation below, there is Offer Model in investment corporation in electrical form, ites is desirable to obtain stock quotation from external service and be injected into electrical form to produce recommendation (such as buy in, hold).
Script may need read from electrical form and write to electrical form, and needs to access outside stock quote service.Author can make script be only limitted to specific stock quote service to the access rights of script.If author will make position blank, whether the user not only wanting inquiry to call service will authorize the authority of script contact service but also ask concrete contact which service.Like this, user can limit script can do what, and script can not contact any other service.
If user wants to share with other users, this is grand in be included in themselves electrical form (such as, copy grand instead of quote grand), and other users can need themselves mandate to access outside stock quote service.If user points to the grand and shared grand of central position by allowing other people, even if user does not have the authority of contact external stock quote service, they also can use grand.In this case, can authorize authority that user's script oneself has (although they can not from the script access services of oneself).
Example 3: accident report
Consider that public transport company wishes the situation of its accident report being carried out to robotization.The driver met with an accidet can access trusteeship service to fill in a form in electrical form, and this charting is as the information of position of bus etc.Grand can be used for, sends to each supervisor to check report.
The correct e-mail address grandly may need to identify supervisor's (such as by grand addressable another electrical form, data base querying etc.), producing legal department also and these people's shared document, also sends Email, accesses other electrical forms (such as comprising the electrical form of the pending record of which accident report).Situation may be that these people need further editing electronic form, then triggers the event of grand further operation of allowing.Grand can at continuation mode operation, like this, grandly when each specific user processes certain grand stage all to suspend, then wait for that next user continues.After being waken up by event, grand check who stopped document (such as document oneself record or the information record that sends to grand event), and can by the time need stop everyone stopped, at this moment, grandly notify other people and record thing all to process (such as in another electrical form).In some implementations, if two events arrive simultaneously, these two events can be queued up, like this, and a grand once only process continuation.Workflow states can be kept in grand local variable context simply, also can partly be recorded in electrical form.
Under correlation circumstance, process completely can be inquired about not and the accident report (such as based on workflow) terminated.The access of this search request comprises the electrical form (or opening electrical form simply) of the status information about accident report.
Example 4: bus dispatching is reported
Consider that public transport company wishes to notify that situation about incuring loss through delay appears in some public bus network of passenger.Company can editing electronic form with upgrade their public transport expected time/position, these editors can carry out automatically, such as calculate roughly based on these information that time of arrival is (such as by the position data that receives about motorbus, leaving the motorbus of station X by identifying, increasing time Y to calculate the time of the X+1 that gets to the station) grand.Some public bus network of grand identifiable design in electrical form is surprisingly incured loss through delay, and if this occurs, the grand text message that sends is to the client that have subscribed notice.Such as, user can subscribe to reception, whenever the text message of user in business district and when arriving turning after his normal bus station two blocks and his any motorbus (such as 692 tunnels, 698 tunnel public transport etc.) on the way likely five minutes.Application on user's mobile device can trigger when user is positioned at appropriate location, to make the mark on trusteeship service excited users record, such user just can receive the renewal (such as by the gps coordinate of user is converted to nearest bus station position) being directed to user's current location without the need to manual input position.
For the purpose of safety, grand author can authorize and send text message to the ability of limited group of user (as the user that lists on another electrical form that keeper controls), and can be only local to worksheet grand issue into, instead of can openly access.Author does not authorize the authority of grand write worksheet.This situation brings the possibility of specific capability scope by reference to the group defined in document or another group message (such as electrical form or some other group definition).
