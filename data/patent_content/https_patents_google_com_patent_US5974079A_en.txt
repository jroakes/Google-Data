Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to communications, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for determining encoding rate in a communication system.
- a receiver in the communication system determines an estimated encoding rate for each received frame.
- the accuracy of the estimated encoding rate affects speech quality since any rate determination error typically causes annoying artifacts in the decoded speech signal.
- the present invention provides a method and apparatus of determining an encoding rate associated with a received signal.
- the method includes the steps of demodulating the received signal to produce a series of metrics representing energies of a series of data symbols carried by the received signal; decoding the series of metrics to produce a set of total metrics corresponding to a set of possible encoding rates; normalizing the set of total metrics to produce a corresponding set of normalized total metrics; and determining the encoding rate based on the set of normalized total metrics.
- the set of total metrics is normalized according to a set effective finger counts which are generated based on the demodulation step.
- the normalizing step includes multiplying the set of effective finger counts by a constant to generate a corresponding set of numbers; and subtracting the set of numbers correspondingly from the set of total metrics to produce the set of normalized total metric.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a receiver according to an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a finger status generator.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart depicting various steps of a method of generating effective finger counts according to an aspect of the present invention.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a total metric normalizer according to an aspect of the present invention.
- the receiver 10 may be a base station receiver such as a receiver in a Motorola SC9600TM base station or may be a receiver in a mobile unit, such as in a conventional code division multiple access (CDMA) cellular phone.
- the receiver 10 includes a demodulator 80, a decoder 20, a rate determination module 24, a vocoder 26, a total metric normalizer 28, and an effective finger counter generator 17.
- demodulator 80 receives a signal 12 which is normally at baseband frequencies, however, the operations of receiver 10 and demodulator 80 are not limited to receiving baseband signals.
- demodulator 80 determines a metric 22 for every data symbol in signal 12. Decoder 20 receives metric 22 for decoding operation. Decoder 20 may be of a convolutional decoder type for implementation according to IS-95 standard. As such, decoder 20 may be a Viterbi decoder as commonly known in the prior art, or a conditional decoder as provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/581,696 entitled “Method and Apparatus for Decoding an Encoded Signal", attorney docket number CE2924R by Schaffner, filed Dec. 29, 1995 which is incorporated by reference herein. In any case, decoder 20, after receiving a metric 22 for every symbol in a CDMA frame, communicates a total metric 90 to total metric normalizer 28, and decoded signal 91 to vocoder 26.
- Total metric 90 may become biased by an unknown magnitude for a variety of reasons. Among them, continuously changing communication system propagation environment, and operations of demodulator 80 and decoder 20 are notable. To eliminate the bias from total metric information 90, total metric 90 is normalized in total metric normalizer 28. As a result, total metric normalizer 28 produces a normalized total metric 23. Normalized total metric 23 is fed to rate determination 24 to be used for producing an estimated encoding rate 83. Operation of rate determination 24 is according to known prior art. As such, rate determination 24 may be as provided in U.S.
- estimated encoding rate 83 is based on normalized total metric 23 which is free of any biased information; therefore, it has a greater accuracy and consistency than estimates based on unnormalized total metric 90.
- Vocoder 26 outputs a speech signal 93 based on decoded signal 91 and estimated encoding rate 83; as a result, speech signal 93 is clear and free of annoying artifacts.
- Decoder 20 produces total metric 90 based on metric 22 of all data symbols in a CDMA frame carried by signal 12.
- demodulator 80 includes a despreader module 14, a fast hadamard transform (FHT) module 16, a metric generator 18, a finger management block 45, and a finger status 82.
- FHT fast hadamard transform
- metric generator 18 a metric generator 18
- finger management block 45 a finger management block 45
- finger status 82 a finger status 82.
- Despreader 14 despreads signal 12 to produce output 88.
- Despreader 14 normally employs RAKE fingers to provide output 88.
- the number of signals in output 88 therefore, corresponds to a number of RAKE fingers employed in despreader 14. All signals in output 88 differently are representing despreaded forms of signal 12.
- Each finger provides a signal representing a despreaded form of signal 12.
- a time offset difference among RAKE fingers employed in despreader 14 accords a difference between the signals in output 88.
- despreader 14
- FHT 16 transforms output 88 to produce a transformed output 30.
- Output 30 has a number of transformed signals. The number of signals corresponds to the number of signals in output 88.
- Metric generator 18 receives output 30 to produce metric 22 for every data symbol in a frame. To produce metric 22, metric generator 18 also takes into account a demodulation type indicated by a demodulation type control 101, and a finger status information provided by finger-status 15.
- demodulation mode control generator for generating control 101 is not shown, one may be incorporated in receiver 10 according to prior art.
- a demodulation mode control generator is provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/734,225 entitled “Method and Apparatus for Demodulating a Modulated Signal", attorney docket number CE3166R by Brown et al, filed Oct. 21, 1996 which is incorporated by reference herein.
- Other demodulation types may be included and controlled accordingly.
- finger status 82 receives a finger lock status 210, and a preliminary combine status 211 from finger management block 45.
- Finger management 45 produces finger lock status 210 and preliminary combine status 211 about each finger employed in despreader 14 while communicating and controlling despreader 14 through an interface 46. Operations of despreader 14 and finger management 45 to produce finger lock status 210 and preliminary combine status 211 are commonly known in prior art. For example, a typical finger management 45 monitors each finger energy output during each power control group (PCG) of a CDMA frame, and accordingly determines which finger is in lock status during a PCG timing.
- PCG power control group
- finger management 45 determines which finger output signal is a candidate for combining with output signals of other fingers based on a comparison of the signal energy output with a predetermined threshold energy. Accordingly, finger management 45 produces lock status 210 and preliminary combine status 211 information about each finger during each PCG timing in a CDMA frame.
- a CDMA frame includes sixteen power control groups (PCG). Accordingly, each finger for each CDMA frame would have a series of sixteen lock status 210, and a series of sixteen preliminary combine status 211 information.
- preliminary combine status 211 is indicated by logical value "1" during a PCG timing when a finger output signal meets the minimum output energy. As such, the signal is a possible candidate during such PCG timing in the CDMA frame for final combining operation performed by metric generator 18.
- a logical value "0" is generated if the output signal energy is below the minimum threshold requirement.
- finger lock status 210 of a finger indicates a lock status for each PCG timing by logical value "1", and an unlock status by logical value "0".
- finger status 82 generates finger-status 15 by performing logical AND function over finger lock status 210 and preliminary combine status 211.
- Finger status generator 82 thus, includes a bank of logical AND gates 201.
- the number of AND gates in 201 is at least, or logically, equal to the number of fingers in despreader 14.
- Each AND gate in 201 has at least two inputs for receiving lock status 210 and preliminary combine status 211 associated with a finger output signal.
- Finger-status 15 indicates to metric generator 18 whether a metric calculated for output signal of a finger during a PCG timing should be combined with metrics calculated for output signal of other fingers during the same PCG timing.
- EFC 19 includes effective finger count information for all possible encoding rates in the communication system.
- a first rate e.g. full rate
- a second rate e.g. one half rate (1/2)
- a third rate e.g. one quarter rate (1/4)
- a fourth rate e.g. one eighth rate (1/8).
- full rate all sixteen PCGs in a CDMA frame are active.
- one half rate, one quarter rate, and one eighth rate respectively eight, four, and two PCG's are active.
- Active PCGs in a CDMA frame for each of one half rate, one quarter rate, and one eighth rate are randomly selected according to a value in a data burst randomization (DBR) 35 register.
- the DBR 35 register is read to find out which PCGs in a CDMA frame are used for a given encoding rate. Since all PCGs are active for full rate, there is no need to read DBR 35 for full rate, only for the rates less than the full rate.
- effective finger count 17 generates four effective finger counts information, for all four possible encoding rates, which all are carried by EFC 19.
- PCG and CDMA frame timings are based on a global system timing 42.
- summed value 311 has a value equal to four for that PCG.
- Summed value 311 is written in its respective PCG in a buffer register 320 according to system timing 42. Since a CDMA frame according to IS-95 standard has 16 PCGs, buffer register 320 for an IS-95standard implementation is shown to have 16 memory locations. To continue the operation while reading summed value 311 for other frames, values in buffer register 320 may be loaded into another buffer once buffer register 320 has received all PCGs in a frame. Then, DBR register 35 is read for calculating and indexing which PCGs correspond to one half rate, one quarter rate, and one eighth rate.
- EFC 19 For full rate, all buffer entries in buffer register 320 are summed at 330. To calculate EFC 19 for one half rate, one quarter rate, and one eighth rate, respectively, buffer register 320 entries as indexed or identified from DBR register 35 are summed at 330. As a result, EFC 19 includes four numbers, each associated with an encoding rate. EFC 19 is then used by total metric normalizer 28 to produce normalized total metric 23.
- total metric normalizer 28 is illustrated.
- TM total metric
- EFC 19 EFC 19 and a predetermined constant 410 are multiplied to produce number 420.
- Constant 410 is selected from memory 412 according to modulation type control 101. Constant 410 is normally predetermined. The value of constant 410 may be dependent on analytical or experimental analysis. For example, if coherent modulation type is selected, constant 410 is equal to 3; similarly, if non-coherent modulation type is selected, constant 410 is equal to 10.
- the amount and distribution of bias in total metric 90 normally vary depending on the demodulation type. Therefore, a modulation type selection is only required if various demodulation types are performed in demodulator 80.
- Normalized total metric 23 Since there are four possible encoding rates in IS-95standard, four total metrics are included in total metric 90. Multiplication at 411 and summation at 430 are repeated for all four possible encoding rates to produce normalized total metric 23. Normalized total metric 23, therefore, includes four normalized total metrics, each corresponding to a possible encoding rate. Estimated encoding rate 83, according to the present invention, is accurate and consistent when produced based on normalized total metric 23.
