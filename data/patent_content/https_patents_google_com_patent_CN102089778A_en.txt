Quality score=1.0/3=$0.33+$0.01=$0.34 of rank/A of A:C
Quality score=0.75/1=$0.75+$0.01=$0.76 of rank/C of C:B
B: minimum every click cost=$0.20
In this example, advertiser A only need need $.34 be retained in the primary importance in the tabulation of advertisement.C need keep the second place by need $.76.Minimum every capital sum of clicking into that advertiser B need pay.
Can with above-mentioned advertisement, the use data that are associated and bid parameter as advertisement data store in advertisement data store 114.Advertiser 102 can further manage distributing advertisement by the given ad activity.Advertising campaign can be stored in the activity data in the advertisement data store 114, it for example can specify the advertising budget that is used for advertisement, when, wherein and can distribute particular advertisement to represent etc. under which kind of situation.
