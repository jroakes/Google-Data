For example, based on the presence detection, intelligence components 116 can adjust device settings to, e.g., conserve power when nobody is home or in a particular room or to accord with user preferences (e.g., general at-home preferences or user-specific preferences). As another example, based on the detection of a particular person, animal or object (e.g., a child, pet or lost object), intelligence components 116 can initiate an audio or visual indicator of where the person, animal or object is or can initiate an alarm or security feature if an unrecognized person is detected under certain conditions (e.g., at night or when lights are out).

For example, intelligence components 116 can detect that a particular device is turned on every week day at 6:30am, or that a device setting is gradually adjusted from a high setting to lower settings over the last three hours. Intelligence components 116 can then predict that the device is to be turned on every week day at 6:30am or that the setting should continue to gradually lower its setting over a longer time period.
- devices can interact with each other such that events detected by a first device influence actions of a second device.
- a first device can detect that a user has pulled into a garage (e.g., by detecting motion in the garage, detecting a change in light in the garage or detecting opening of the garage door).
- the first device can transmit this information to a second device, such that the second device can, e.g., adjust a home temperature setting, a light setting, a music setting, and/or a security-alarm setting.
- a first device can detect a user approaching a front door (e.g., by detecting motion or sudden light-pattern changes).

- the most suitable model may thus depend on which HVAC stages are actuated by the HVAC state control simulator 622 and as defined by the information indicative of one or more simulated HVAC actuation states received by the HVAC state control simulator 622.

- the indoor temperature predictor 624 may also acquire and use a variety of information.
- the indoor temperature predictor 624 may acquire and use information such as an expected outdoor environmental characteristic (e.g., an expected outdoor temperature), an expected structural environmental characteristic (e.g., an expected temperature of the structure), a time that is local to the structure for which the environmental characteristics are being determined, etc.

For each time increment the expected change in indoor temperature T ndoor (k+l) may be fed back to the HVAC state control simulator 622 so that the HVAC state control simulator 622 may determine the expected indoor temperature for comparison with the input setpoint temperature.
- the discrete HVAC actuation state elements U(k) may be aggregated to generate an expected HVAC actuation control trajectory and the expected changes in indoor temperature T ndoor (k+l) may be aggregated to generate an expected indoor temperature profile.

- the indoor temperature predictor 624 may acquire a thermodynamic model of the structure for characterizing an environmental characteristic trajectory of the structure.
- the model may be founded upon a preselected, predetermined plurality of basis functions that characterize a contribution of a plurality of basis factors, some of them having direct physical significant and others having only associative mathematical significance, on the environmental characteristic trajectory in response to an actuation state of the HVAC system.

Further, t is the time of day in local time, f ycle is the the elapsed time since the beginning of a current cycle, tea y-state ⁇ estimated time in a cycle that steady-state activity begins to overcome early- cycle activity, n is indoor temperature, T° ut is outdoor temperature, 7* ir " ci " re i s structure temperature, and U is the active HVAC stage(s), such as stage 1 heating, stage 2 heating, stage 2 cooling, auxiliary heating, drifting/HVAC off.

For example, thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 may acquire values for the weighting factors Wji, Wj2, Wj3, Wj4, and wp from the thermodynamic model generator 630, an expected outdoor temperature T° ut over the prediction time period from a remote entity, and values for the constants ⁇ and ⁇ . As the thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 progresses through the time-wise sequence of input desired environmental conditions, the predicted indoor temperature at a given time during the prediction period may be used as an input, such as Tl" , for predicting the thermodynamic behavior at a subsequent time in the prediction.
- Tl an input
- the temperature of the structure, 7 * ruc ure may be determined using one or more sensors operable to detect such information (e.g., a temperature sensor coupled to a wall of the structure). In other embodiments, however, the temperature of the structure may not be directly acquired, but rather may be estimated.
- an initial structural temperature may be set to an indoor temperature at a certain time. The time may be selected as a transition time between environmental characteristics in or around the structure. For example, the time may be selected as the time during which a hot period of the day transitions to a cool period. This may be determined, for example, by determining the maximum and minimum temperatures over a certain period, determining the average temperature over that period, and then determining the time at which the average temperature is reached. In a number of environments, this may be around 11pm, midnight, lam, a time between 11pm and lam, or a time before 11pm or after lam.
- an initial structure temperature may be set to the indoor temperature at that time, and then for each of a plurality of successive times thereafter, the estimated structural temperature may be determined as a weighted combination of previous indoor and outdoor temperatures.
- the weightings may be equal to one another, such that indoor temperature and outdoor temperature are equally considered in estimating the structure temperature, or could be different than one another.

- a cycle is a period over which an HVAC system is actuated in accordance with a particular HVAC actuation state.
- early-cycle activity occurs during which most of the temperature change is carried over from a previous cycle, and the HVAC begins to ramp up.
- steady- state activity occurs during which HVAC effect gradually diminishes as the temperature moves toward the setpoint and away from the outdoor temperature, and changes in outdoor temperature, structure temperature, and time of day greatly affect the temperature profile.
- cycle refers to a period during which a particular HVAC actuation state is in effect with respect to the energy-consuming parameters (i.e., actuation stage(s)) of interest for the model being considered.
- the parameter of interest is simply whether the heating is ON or OFF.
- the time that the HVAC is ON and then OFF represents two distinct consecutive cycles.
- the time that heater is on (regardless of fan state), and then the heater is off (regardless of fan state) represents two distinct consecutive cycles.
- g(f ycle ) may set equal to 1 / (1 + ⁇ (- ⁇ (f ycle - f eady ⁇ state ))), where f tead y- state i s the estimated time in a cycle that steady-state activity begins to overcome early-cycle activity, as previously described. This is a monotonic non-decreasing logistic function that increases smoothly after the beginning of the cycle, as shown in FIG. 7.

If no candidate models are found, then a new model may be generated and returned. If one candidate is found, then that model may be returned. If multiple candidates are found, then the most restrictive model may be returned. In this particular example, the existing model may not be sufficiently specific to satisfy the request, in which case a new model may be generated that is tailored to the request.
- Input/output logic 632 includes logic operable to communicatively interface components of the thermodynamic model generator 630 with other components, such as thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620.

- Data acquisition unit 638 may acquire temperature information such as the indoor temperature, outdoor temperature, structure temperature, and the like, where some or all of such data may be acquired from one or more sensors 640. Data acquisition unit 638 may also or alternatively acquire HVAC actuation state information, which may indicate which stage or stages or the HVAC system were actuated during the period of time during which the HVAC system controlled the thermal environment of the structure from, e.g., HVAC state controller 642.
- HVAC actuation state information may indicate which stage or stages or the HVAC system were actuated during the period of time during which the HVAC system controlled the thermal environment of the structure from, e.g., HVAC state controller 642.

- thermodynamic model including the weighting factors is returned.
- information indicative of the value of the weighting factors Wji, Wj2, Wj3, Wj4, and w,j may be communicated from the thermodynamic model generator 630 to the thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620.
- FIG. 10 provides a particular process for determining a suitable thermodynamic model according to an embodiment.
- Other sequences of operations may also be performed according to alternative embodiments.
- alternative embodiments of the present invention may perform the operations outlined above in a different order.
- the individual operations illustrated in FIG. 10 may include multiple sub-operations that may be performed in various sequences as appropriate to the individual operations.
- additional operations may be added or existing operations removed depending on the particular applications.
- One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize and appreciate many variations, modifications, and alternatives.
- a number of models may be stored in model storage element 636 for use by the thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620.
- the model may trained (i.e., generated) and the parameters thereof stored in a model cache such as model storage element 636. While the models may subsequently be used to satisfy subsequent requests, in some embodiments the models stored in model storage element 636 may become stale after a certain period of time, such as after 24 hours. In some cases, the time period during which a stored model is valid may be correlated with the time period of data used to generate the models. Once a model becomes stale, even if the model may be suitable to satisfy a model request, the model may not be returned but rather a new model may be generated.
- an HVAC system may include a number of stages, such as a fan, stage one heat, stage two heat, etc.
- a request for a thermodynamic model may indicate a desired level of specificity. If a model exists that satisfies the requested criteria, such a model may be returned. Otherwise, a new model specifically tailored to the requested criteria may be generated and returned.
- an HVAC actuation state may be defined by binary settings of the stages, where each stage may have a binary ON state or a binary OFF state.
- Table 1 illustrates an example sequence of HVAC states.
- thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 may make a request such as "Give me a model for the structure which is valid when
- StageOneHeat is on.
- a problem with such a request is that there is no data measured when only StageOneHeat is on because the Fan is also always on at the same time.
- the thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 probably doesn't care if the fan is on. So the request should really be more specific, such as "Give me a model for the structure which is valid when StageOneHeat is on and I don 't care about the other stages.
- a problem with this request is that as indicated in Table 1 , some of the data when StageOneHeat is on was collected while StageTwoHeat was also on, and the StageTwoHeat data probably distorts the model.
- thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 when requesting a model, should specify which switches it cares about in addition to the specific settings of those switches. For example, thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 may make a request such as "Give me a model for the structure which is valid when StageOneHeat is on and StageTwoHeat is off and EmergencyHeat is off and I don 't care about the settings of any other stages. " In view of these complexities, when making a request for a model, thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 may specify the set of stages that it cares about in the form of a mask.
- model storage element 636 After the most specific example request above, there will be model in the model storage element 636 that was generated from: mask: Fan - don't care; StageOneHeat - care; StageTwoHeat - care; EmergencyHeat - care actuation state: Fan - N/A; StageOneHeat - On; StageTwoHeat - Off; EmergencyHeat - Off Any subsequent request for "Give me a model for the structure which is valid when
- StageOneHeat is on and StageTwoHeat is off and EmergencyHeat is off and I don 't care about the settings of any other stages" will get this same model and be able to reuse it.
- a model's definition may be expanded during fitting.
- a request for "Give me a model for the structure which is valid when StageOneHeat is on and StageTwoHeat is off but I don 't care about Fan or EmergencyHeat” will not be able to reuse the same model because the model was trained on data for which EmergencyHeat was off.
- the thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 doesn't care about the EmergencyHeat setting and so the prefit model isn't general enough.
- the model fitting unit 648 can change the request on the fly from "EmergencyHeat must be off to "I don't care about EmergencyHeat” without changing the model parameters.
- the more general model can be reused for the 2nd request, above.
- the same validation may be made again to ensure there isn't any data with EmergencyHeat on creeping into the model used by the thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 for the instance it specified it only wants data when EmergencyHeat is off.
- a model's definition may be restricted during fitting. Similar to the above example, assume a request had been made for a model "when StageOneHeat is on and I don 't care about Humidification. " During fitting, the model fitting unit 648 may notice that although the request didn't care about humidification, in fact, humidification was always off. If the fitting algorithm makes note of that fact in the model, then a second subsequent request for "when StageOneHeat is on and Humidification must be off" could reuse the same model.
- a model may keep track of various bits independently for each HVAC stage as illustrates in Table 2.
- the MaskEither bit is an input into the fitting algorithm, where the model request may specify this as the mask parameter.
- the Both bit is an output from the model fitting unit 648 after model fitting is complete, and may be set to reflect the data which was chosen to fit the model.

- a new thermodynamic model may be generated, for example, by model fitting unit 648, as discussed with reference to operations 706B through 706D. Further, the new thermodynamic model may be generated based on the level of specificity indicated in the request.
- processing may continue to operation 706EE where it is determined whether the new model may be generalized or restricted.
- the new model may be generalized, or expanded, if it is determined that the data used to generate the model having the requested level of specificity may also satisfy a model request indicating a less restrictive level of specificity.
- the new model may be restricted, or narrowed, if it is determined that the data used to generate the model having the requested level of specificity may also satisfy a model request indicating a more restrictive level of specificity.
- processing may continue to operation 706FF where the new model is generalized or restricted.
