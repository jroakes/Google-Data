- Computing the respective plurality of signal scores for each of the events can further include: obtaining search results for a search query that includes a first term identifying the physical location and a second term indicating an interest in events occurring in the physical location; determining a position in a ranking of the search results of a highest-ranked search result that mentions the event; determining a frequency with which the event is mentioned in the search results; and computing a fifth signal score of the plurality of signal scores for the event based at least in part on position of the highest-ranked search result that mentions the event and the frequency with which the event is mentioned in the search results.
- Computing the respective plurality of signal scores for each of the events can further include: obtaining data identifying a venue hosting the event; obtaining data identifying a seating capacity of the venue; and computing a sixth signal score of the plurality of signal scores for the event based at least in part on the seating capacity of the venue.
- Events in a given location can be ranked so that popular or interesting events can be easily identified.
- the ranking can be adjusted to ensure that highly-ranked events are diverse and different from one another.
- Events matching a variety of event criteria can be ranked so that popular or interesting events can be easily identified.
- the ranking can be provided to other systems or services that can use the ranking to enhance the user experience.
- a search engine can use the ranking to identify the most popular events that are relevant to a received search query and present the most popular events to the user in response to the received query.
- a recommendation engine can use the ranking to provide information identifying popular or interesting events to users that match the users' interests.
- FIG. 1 shows an example event ranking system.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating an example technique for ranking events that satisfy received event criteria.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating an example technique for generating a popularity score for an event.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating an example technique for computing modified popularity scores for events.
- FIG. 1 shows an example event ranking system 120 .
- the event ranking system 120 is an example of a system implemented as computer programs on one or more data processing apparatus in one or more geographic locations, in which the systems, components, and techniques described below can be implemented.
- a user 102 can interact with the event ranking system 120 or a search engine 110 through a user device 104 .
- the user device 104 will generally include a memory, e.g., a random access memory (RAM) 106 , for storing instructions and data and a processor 108 for executing stored instructions.
- the memory can include both read only and writable memory.
- the user device 104 can be a data processing apparatus coupled to the event ranking system 120 or the through a data communication network 112 , e.g., local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet, or a combination of networks, any of which may include wireless links.
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the search engine 110 is implemented on one or more data processing apparatus in one or more physical locations and provides search results in response to received search queries. For example, in response to a search query received from the user device 104 , the search engine 110 can use a resource index to identify resources that are relevant to the query.
- the resources are each associated with a resource address and can include, for example, HyperTextMarkup Language (HTML) pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources.
- HTML HyperTextMarkup Language
- PDF portable document format
- the search engine 110 generates search results that identify the relevant resources and returns the search results to the user device 104 .
- the search engine 110 ranks the search results, i.e., places the search results in an order, according to respective scores associated with the resources identified by the search results.
- the scores are generated using a scoring function and generally relate to the quality, the relevance, or both of the resource.
- the event ranking system 120 can receive requests, e.g., from the user device 102 or from the search engine 110 , for events that match one or more event criteria. In response, the event ranking system 120 can identify events from an event data store 130 that satisfy the event criteria and generate a ranking for the events.
- the event data store 130 can be one or more data stores in one or more locations that store information identifying events taking place in various physical locations, e.g., countries, cities, states, or neighborhoods. Generally, the events identified in the event data store 130 are occurrences that happen at a specified physical location and for a specified period of time.
- the event data store can also store information about the events.
- the event data store can store data identifying the venue hosting the event, the event category that the event belongs to, e.g., concert, sporting event, festival, fair, or trade show, a summary that describes the event, and values of one or more attributes of the event, e.g., whether the event is indoors or outdoors, the cost to attend the event, whether a ticket must be purchased in advance, and so on.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating an example technique 200 for ranking events that satisfy received event criteria.
- the technique 200 can be performed by one or more data processing apparatus.
- an event ranking system e.g., the event ranking system 120 of FIG. 1
- the system receives event criteria ( 202 ).
- the event criteria specify a physical location, e.g., a city, a specific neighborhood within a city, or a geographic radius, and, optionally, a time period during which matching events must occur. If the event criteria do not specify a time period, the system can select a default time period, e.g., the next week, the next day, or the next weekend.
- the event criteria may specify an event category to which matching events must apply, e.g., the event criteria may specify that the event has to belong to a “concert” or a “sporting event” category.
- the event criteria may specify an attribute value that matching events must possess, e.g., the criteria may specify that a cost of attendance attribute have the value “free” or that an indoor or outdoor event attribute have the value “outdoor.” Further optionally, the event criteria may specify one or more terms that must be included in a title, description, or both, of a matching event, e.g., the criteria may specify that “Halloween” must be included in the title of each matching event.
- the system selects events matching the event criteria ( 204 ) from events identified in an event data store, e.g., the event data store 130 of FIG. 1 .
- the system computes a popularity score for each selected event ( 206 ) and ranks the events according to their popularity scores ( 208 ). Generating a popularity score for an event is described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the system computes a modified popularity score for each event ( 210 ) and ranks the events according to the modified popularity scores ( 212 ). Computing a modified popularity score is described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 4 .
- the system can compute modified popularity scores and re-rank the events multiple times, e.g., by performing the technique described below with reference to FIG. 4 multiple times, in order to determine the final ranking of the events.
- the system can provide data identifying the ranking of the events to, e.g., a search engine or a user device in response to an event request. If the system provides the data to a search engine, the search engine may then further modify the ranking, e.g., based on a received search query, and then provide the ranking for display to a user, e.g., as part of a response to the received search query.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating an example technique 300 for generating a popularity score for an event.
- the technique 300 can be performed by one or more data processing apparatus.
- an event ranking system e.g., the event ranking system 120 of FIG. 1
- the system computes a set of signal scores for the event ( 304 ). That is, the system computes multiple scores for the event, with each score being computed based on a respective signal generated or obtained by the system.
- the system computes a unique mentions score as one of the signal scores ( 306 ).
- the unique mentions score is a measure of how frequently the event is mentioned in Internet resources.
- the system computes the unique mentions score based on a count of Internet sites that include at least one mention of the event, with a mention of an event being an occurrence of a recognized reference to the event in the contents of a resource that is part of the site.
- the system can be configured to treat different kinds of collections of resources as a site.
- the system can treat as a site a collection of resources that are hosted on a particular server.
- resources in a site can be accessed through a network, e.g., the Internet, using an Internet address, e.g., a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), corresponding to a server on which the site is hosted.
- a network e.g., the Internet
- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- a site can be defined operationally as the resources in a domain, e.g., “example.com,” where the resources in the domain, e.g., “host.example.com/resource1,” “www.example.com/folder/resource2,” or “example.com/resource3,” are in the site.
- a site can be defined operationally using a subdomain, e.g., “www.example.com,” where the resources in the subdomain, e.g., “www.example.com/resource1” or “www.example.com/folder/resource2,” are in the site.
- a site can be defined operationally using a subdirectory, e.g., “example.com/subdirectory,” where the resources in the subdirectory, e.g., “example.com/subdirectory/resource.html,” are in the site.
- the system can classify certain sites as being ticketing sites, i.e., sites that sell tickets to events. For example, the system can classify as ticketing sites site having a URL that includes one or more predetermined white-listed terms that have been determined to be ticketing related, e.g., “ticket” or “coupon.” In these implementations, the system can compute the unique mentions score based on the count of sites that include at least one mention of the event and on how many of the sites that include at least one mention of the event are ticketing sites.
- the demotion can be computed so that events that have a higher ratio of ticketed sites will have a smaller demotion value, i.e., have their unique mentions score decreased more, than events that have a lower ratio of ticketed sites.
- the demotion is computed so that it does not fall below a pre-determined minimum value.
- the system computes an official page selection score as one of the signal scores ( 308 ).
- the official page selection score is a measure of how frequently users select search results identifying a resource that has been classified by the system as the official web page of the event.
- a user selection of a search result can be, e.g., a user action made with respect to the search result that initiates a request for the resource identified by the search result.
- the user action with respect to the search result may be a “click” on the search result, a voice-based selection, or a selection by a user's finger on a presence-sensitive input mechanism, e.g., a touch-screen device, or any other appropriate selection mechanism.
- selection data may not be tethered to the identity of individual users.
- the official page selection score may be computed based in part on a peak number of user selections of search results identifying the official page during a time window of predetermined size, e.g., a day or a week.
- the system can consider only windows during a recent time period, e.g., the past week or the past month, when determining the peak number of selections.
- the system can decrease the peak number of user selections that are counted for the event, e.g., by dividing the number of selections counted for the event by the number of recurrences of the event during the recent time window that is being considered by the system.
- the system has access to data that classifies certain terms as being related to resources.
- the related terms for a given resource can be query terms from search queries that have frequently resulted in users selecting a search result identifying the resource.
- the data stored in the event data store for the event may also identify terms that are related to the event.
- the system may compute a relevance measure that measures how relevant the official web page for the event is to the event.
- the relevance measure can be computed based on how similar the terms that are related to the official web page are to the terms that are related to the event.
- the relevance measure can be a cosine distance between vectors that representing the terms that relate to the official web page and vectors representing the terms that relate to the event.
- the system can determine the official web page for the event in any of a variety of ways.
- the system can generate one or more search queries derived from terms that are relevant to the event.
- the search queries can include any of a name of the event, a location of the event, the venue of the event, the time of the event, and descriptive terms associated with the event in the event data store.
- the system can obtain search results for each search query and, if more than one search query has been issued, intersect the results.
- the system can then select the resource identified by the highest-ranked search result in the intersected set of search results as the official web page for the event.
- the data stored in the event data store for the event may identify the official web page for the event.
- the system computes an entity popularity score as one of the signal scores ( 310 ).
- the entity popularity score is a measure of popularity of entities that have been classified as being relevant to the event.
- the system can provide a text summary of the event to a system that maps text to entities that are topical to the text and, optionally, assigns each entity a topicality score and a confidence score.
- the system then computes the entity popularity score based on the global popularity of the obtained entities.
- the global popularity of the obtained entities can be determined based on a number of search queries that include a reference to the entity that have been submitted to a search engine.
- the system computes an event category score as one of the signal scores ( 312 ).
- the system obtains data, e.g., from the event data store, identifying an event category to which the event belongs. The system can then determine whether the category has been previously classified as a promoted or demoted category. For example, trade shows may be classified as a demoted category because they tend to appeal to a limited audience, while festivals and fairs may be classified as a promoted category because they tend to appeal to a broader audience but may not be well-publicized.
- the system can then assign a default event category score to the event if the category is not a promoted or demoted category, assign a promoted event category score to the event if the category is a promoted category, and assign a demoted event category score to the event if the category is a demoted category.
- the system computes a ranking score as one of the signal scores ( 314 ).
- the ranking score is a measure of how well represented the event is in resources identified by search results for a search query that indicates an interest in events in the location in which the event takes place.
- the search query may be a search query that includes a term that identifies a location and another term that indicates an interest in events occurring in the location, e.g., “events in san francisco” or “san francisco events.”
- the system obtains search results for the search query from a search engine.
- the obtained search results are ranked according to scores generated by the search engine.
- the system can then compute the ranking score based on a position in the ranking of search results of the highest-ranked search result that identifies a resource that mentions the event, the number of mentions of the event in resources identified by a pre-determined number of highest-ranked search results, or both.
- the ranking score RS can be computed such that:
- RS 1 + 1 srp + min ⁇ ⁇ ( K a , nm K b ) , where K a and K b are constants, srp is the position of the highest-ranked search result that identifies a resource that mentions the event, and nm is the number of mentions of the event in resources identified by the pre-determined number of highest-ranked search results.
- the system computes a venue score as one of the signal scores ( 316 ).
- the venue score is a measure of the prominence of the venue at which the event is hosted. If the event is not associated with a venue, e.g., a marathon or a street fair, the system can assign the event a default venue score.
- the system can compute the venue score based on any of a variety of factors. For example, the system can compute the venue score based in part on a ranking of the venue of in a ranking of local places or local venues obtained from a local search engine. As another example, the system can compute the venue score based in part on a seating capacity of the venue, i.e., so that events held in venues with larger seating capacities are assigned larger venue scores. As another example, the system can compute the venue score based in part on the popularity of other events in the venue, i.e., so that events held in venues that tend to host more popular events are assigned higher venue scores.
- the system combines the signal scores to generate the popularity score for the event ( 318 ).
- the popularity score for the event can be the sum of the signal scores, the product of the signal scores, or an average of the signal scores.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating an example technique 400 for generating modified popularity scores for events.
- the technique 400 can be performed by one or more data processing apparatus.
- an event ranking system e.g., the event ranking system 120 of FIG. 1
- the system obtains popularity scores for events occurring in a particular location ( 402 ).
- the system obtains data identifying an event category to which each of the events belongs ( 404 ).
- the system can obtain the data from, e.g., an event data store, e.g., the event data store 130 of FIG. 1 .
- the system computes a diversity demotion for each event ( 406 ).
- the system can calculate the diversity demotion for an event based on a count of events that belong to the same category as the event and are above the event in a ranking of events according to their popularity scores.
- the system computes a similar event demotion for each event ( 408 ).
- the system can calculate the similar event demotion for an event based on a count of similar events to the event that are above the event in the ranking of events according to their popularity scores.
- a similar event may be another occurrence of the event, i.e., if the event is a recurring event.
- two events that are hosted at the same venue, belong to the same category, and occur on the same day may also be considered to be similar events. For example, two rock concerts at the same concert venue on the same day may be considered similar events.
- the system can compute the similar event demotion SED such that:
- the system computes a modified popularity score for each event ( 410 ).
- the system computes the modified popularity score for an event by applying the diversity demotion and the similar event demotion computed for the event to the popularity score.
- the modified popularity score for an event can be the product of the popularity score for the event, the diversity demotion for the event, and the similar event demotion for the event.
- the system can compute the modified popularity score by subtracting the diversity demotion and the similar event demotion from the popularity score.
- the system can filter the events from the ranking. For example, the system can remove events having diversity demotion or similarity event demotions that are above a particular threshold value from the ranking.

Abstract
Description
UM=ln(e+sc*dem),
where sc is the count of sites that include at least one mention of the event, and dem is a demotion calculated based on the ratio of sites that include at least one mention of the event that have been classified as ticketing sites. The demotion can be computed so that events that have a higher ratio of ticketed sites will have a smaller demotion value, i.e., have their unique mentions score decreased more, than events that have a lower ratio of ticketed sites. In some implementations, the demotion is computed so that it does not fall below a pre-determined minimum value.
OP=K a *e^(K b *e^(K c *ps*rel))+K d,
where Ka, Kb, Kc, and Kd are constant values, ps is the peak number of selections and rel is the relevance measure. If no resource has been classified as the official page for the event, the system can set the official page selection score equal to a default value.
where Ka and Kb are constants, srp is the position of the highest-ranked search result that identifies a resource that mentions the event, and nm is the number of mentions of the event in resources identified by the pre-determined number of highest-ranked search results.
DD=Kx,
where K is a constant value between zero and one, and x is the count of events that belong to the same category as the event and are above the event in the ranking of events according to their popularity scores.
where R is a constant value, and y is the count of events that are similar to the event and are above the event in the ranking of events according to their popularity scores.
