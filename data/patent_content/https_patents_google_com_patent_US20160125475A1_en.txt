TECHNICAL FIELD
-
The present disclosure relates generally to improving the electronic bidding process for electronic auctions for electronic advertising spaces.
BACKGROUND
-
Advertisers maximize the value of advertising by efficiently selecting advertising spaces that effectively produce conversions. In the service industry, users may be more likely to purchase a service or a product at certain times or at a certain length of time before the performance of the service. For example, in certain service industries a user may be unlikely to purchase or reserve a service more than one week ahead of performance of the service while in other service industries a user may be likely to reserve a service months ahead of performance of the service. Additionally, merchants seeking to advertise obtain the most benefit from advertising during times of high availability of merchant services. For example, merchants obtain less benefit from advertising as user reservations for a service approach the capacity of the merchant to provide the service and obtain more benefit from advertising during times at which user reservations are low with respect to the merchant's capacity to provide the service.
SUMMARY
-
Techniques herein provide computer-implemented methods to adjust bids for electronic advertising spaces based on merchant system availability. In an example embodiment, an advertising system receives, from a merchant system, a merchant system reservation calendar comprising an availability for the merchant system, marketing information, and bidding preferences for auctions for advertising spaces. The advertising system receives a notice of an auction for an advertising space from an advertising platform. The advertising system determines a first bid for the auction based on the availability of the merchant system, the marketing information, and the merchant system's bidding preferences. The advertising system transmits the first bid for the auction to the advertising platform. The advertising system receives a notice of an incomplete auction from the advertising platform. The advertising system receives, from the merchant system, an updated merchant system reservation calendar comprising an updated availability for the merchant system and determines a second bid for the advertising space auction based on the updated merchant system availability, the marketing preferences, and the bidding preferences for auctions. The advertising system transmits the second bid to the advertising platform. The advertising system receives a notice of a completed auction from the advertising platform and transmits the notice to the merchant system.
-
In certain other example aspects described herein, systems and computer program products to adjust bids for electronic advertising spaces based on merchant system availability are provided.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
Overview
-
The example embodiments described herein provide computer-implemented techniques for bidding and adjusting bids for advertising spaces based on merchant system availability.
-
In an example embodiment, an advertising system receives, from a merchant system, a merchant system reservation calendar comprising an availability for the merchant system, marketing information, and bidding preferences for auctions for advertising spaces. The advertising system receives a notice of an auction for an advertising space from an advertising platform. The advertising system determines a first bid for the auction based on the availability of the merchant system, the marketing information, and the merchant system's bidding preferences. The advertising system transmits the first bid for the auction to the advertising platform. The advertising system receives a notice of an incomplete auction from the advertising platform. The advertising system receives an updated merchant system reservation calendar comprising an updated availability for the merchant system from the merchant system and determines a second bid for the auction based on the updated merchant system availability, the marketing preferences, and the bidding preferences for auctions. The advertising system transmits the second bid to the advertising platform. The advertising system receives a notice of a completed auction from the advertising platform and transmits the notice to the merchant system.
-
In an example embodiment, a user accesses a merchant system website via a user computing device. For example, the user accesses the merchant website via a web browser on the user computing device. The user selects an option to make a reservation with the merchant system. In an example embodiment, the merchant system is a service industry wherein the industry custom is for users to purchase tickets or make reservations at a time before the merchant system performs a service. For example, the merchant system may be a restaurant chain, a medical service, or a transportation service. The merchant system incorporates the user reservation into a merchant system reservation calendar.
-
In an example embodiment, the merchant system comprises a reservation calendar that the merchant system uses to determine availability. For example, an airline merchant system keeps a log of seating availability for each flight for each calendar day. For example, if the airline merchant system has reserved 50 seats out of a 250 seat airplane and 200 seats are available to purchase or reserve, the airline determines that the flight is at 80% availability. Likewise, a hotel merchant system may determine guest room availability, a restaurant merchant system may determine table availability, and a doctor's office merchant system may determine appointment availability using a reservation calendar. In another example embodiment, the reservation calendar is managed by an advertising system and the merchant system accesses the reservation calendar via a network to log user reservations or purchases.
-
The merchant system allocates funds for an advertising system. For example, the merchant system enters into an agreement with the advertising system for the advertising system to provide advertising services for merchant system. In this example, the merchant system allocates a certain amount of funds for the advertising system to spend over a predetermined time period. For example, the advertising system may spend the allocated funds on advertisement space with one or more advertising platforms, such as websites, television, radio, or paper advertisements. In an example embodiment, the advertising system bids for advertisement space with one or platforms against other advertising systems or merchant systems in advertisement space auctions. For example, multiple merchants and/or advertising systems bid for a 24 hour ad space on a website.
-
The merchant system transmits marketing information to the advertising system. In an example embodiment, the merchant system transmits statistics concerning the merchant system or the industry associated with the merchant system. In an example, marketing information comprises a statistical distribution of the customers with respect to the length of time users make reservations before the merchant system renders a performance of service associated with the reservations. For example, the merchant system transmits an average time in advance that customers generally reserve or purchase services or products with the merchant system. In an example, the merchant system transmits statistics that show that 25% of customers reserve a service between a month ahead of time and two weeks ahead of time, 50% of customers reserve a service within two weeks ahead of time and two days ahead of time, and 25% of customers reserve a service within two days ahead of time and the time of service. In this example, “ahead of time” means a time before the merchant system renders a service or product to the customer as part of a customer's transaction. The merchant system allows the advertising system access to the merchant system reservation calendar. In an example embodiment, the merchant system allows the advertising system continuous access to the merchant system reservation calendar. For example, the advertising system has remote access the merchant system reservation calendar or a merchant system server periodically or continuously transmits updates of the merchant system reservation calendar to the advertising system. In another example embodiment, the advertising system maintains the merchant system reservation calendar.
-
The merchant system defines bidding parameters. For example, the merchant system defines a low bidding threshold, a high bidding threshold, and acceptable bidding intervals according to availability. For example, the merchant system may define $1.00 as a low bidding threshold for a 24 hour advertising space on a website and $100.00 as the high bidding threshold. In this example, the merchant system may define $1.00 as an acceptable bid when the merchant is at 100% availability and $100.00 as an acceptable bid when the merchant system is at 0% availability. In this example, the merchant system may instruct the advertising system to increase the bid for the advertising space by $1.00 or each decrease in availability of 1% and decrease the bid for the advertising space by $1.00 for each increase in the availability of 1%. For example, if the current bid was $40.00 and the availability decreased by 5%, the bidding parameters would instruct the advertising to increase the bid by $5.00 to $45.00. In another example embodiment, the bidding parameters may instruct the advertising system to further increase or decrease the bid for the advertising space based on the transmitted marketing preferences. For example, if the marketing information observes that most customers wait until a few days ahead of time to make a reservation or purchase a service from a merchant system, the merchant system may instruct the advertising system to make low bids when the advertising time slot is two weeks ahead of time, even if the availability is low. The advertising system receives the merchant system bidding preferences. In an example embodiment, the merchant system bidding preferences comprise the allocated funds, the marketing information, and the bidding parameters.
-
An advertising platform transmits a notice of an advertising space auction to the advertising system. In an example embodiment, the advertising platform is separate from the advertising system. In another example embodiment, the advertising system comprises or is associated with the advertising platform. For example, the advertising system maintains a website advertising platform comprising advertising space for which the advertising system hosts advertising space auctions. The advertising system receives the notice of the advertising space auction. The advertising system determines merchant system availability via the merchant system reservation calendar. The advertising system determines the initial bid for the auction based on the merchant availability and marketing information. The advertising system transmits the initial bid on behalf of the merchant system to the advertising platform. The advertising platform receives the initial bid from the advertising system.
-
The advertising platform transmits notification of the progress of the auction to the advertising system. For example, the advertising platform transmits notification of the progress of the auction to the advertising system at regular intervals, for example, every five minutes. In an example, the advertising platform also transmits notification to the advertising system when an auction is completed. For example, the advertising platform transmits notification to the advertising system when the merchant system wins the auction for the advertising space or when another party wins the auction for the advertising space. The advertising system receives notification of the progress of the auction. If the auction is complete, the advertising system transmits a notice to the merchant system. In an example, the advertising system only transmits a notice to the merchant system if the merchant system wins the auction for the advertising space. In another example embodiment, the advertising system transmits a notices of completed auctions to the merchant system regardless of if the merchant system won the auction or not.
-
If the auction is not complete, the advertising system accesses or receives an updated merchant reservation calendar from the merchant system. The advertising system determines a new bid based on merchant bidding preferences. If the newly determined bid is not different from the previous bid, the previous bid is maintained. If the newly determined bid is different from the previous bid, the advertising system transmits the new bid to the advertising platform for the auction. The advertising platform receives the new bid. As previously discussed, when the advertising system receives a notification that the auction has been completed, the advertising system transmits a notice to the merchant system. Otherwise, the advertising system continues to receive notification of the progress of the auction, evaluates the merchant system availability, and determines whether to increase or decrease the merchant system bid for the advertising space based on the merchant availability and the marketing information.
-
By using and relying on the methods and systems described herein, the advertising system determines bids for electronic advertising space auctions on behalf of the merchant system based on merchant availability. By determining and making bids on behalf of the merchant system to the advertising platform, the advertising system eliminates or reduces any interaction between computing devices associated with the merchant system and the advertising platform. Additionally, by giving the advertising system access to the merchant system reservation calendar, interactions between merchant system and the advertising system are minimized. For example, in certain embodiments, the methods and systems described herein do not require the merchant system to actively submit a merchant system reservation calendar since the advertising system has periodic or continual access to the reservation calendar. As such, the systems and methods described herein may reduce the inputs required and the processing required by the merchant system. Additionally, the systems and methods described herein may improve the efficiency of merchant system advertising. For example, by decreasing the bid for advertising spaces as availability decreases, the advertising system economizes the advertising resources of the merchant system since advertising conversion is desired less as availability decreases.

In an example embodiment, the bidding module 137 transmits the initial bid to the advertising platform 140. In an example embodiment, at a time after transmitting the initial bid for the advertising space auction to the advertising platform 140, the bidding module 137 receives a notification of the progress of the advertising space auction from the advertising platform 140. In an example embodiment, if the auction is complete, the bidding module 137 transmits a notification to the merchant system 120.
-
In another example embodiment, if the auction is not complete, the bidding module 137 receives updated availability information from the merchant system via the availability module 135. In this example embodiment, the availability module 135 receives an updated merchant reservation calendar via the network 150 from the merchant system 120 and determines the updated merchant system 120 availability. In an example embodiment, the bidding module determines a new bid for the advertising space auction based on the updated availability information, the bidding parameters, and the marketing information. In an example embodiment, the new bid is the same value as the initial bid. In this example embodiment, the bidding module 137 waits to receive another notification of the progress of the advertising space auction.
-
In another example embodiment, the new bid is different from the initial bid. In this example embodiment, the bidding module 137 transmits the new bid to the advertising platform 140 over the network 150. In an example embodiment, the bidding module 137 receives a notification of the progress of the advertising space auction from the advertising platform 140. In an example embodiment, if the auction is complete, the bidding module 137 transmits a notification of completion of the auction to the merchant system 120 via the network 150. In an example embodiment, if the auction is not complete, the bidding module 137 continues to repeat the bidding process until receiving a notification from the advertising platform that the advertising space auction is complete. In an example embodiment, when the bidding module 137 determines that the advertising space auction is complete, the bidding module 137 transmits a notification to the merchant system 120 that the auction is complete via the network 150.
-
An example advertising platform 140 conducts the sale of one or more advertising spaces via advertising space auctions. In an example advertising space auction, one or more competing advertising systems 130 and/or merchant systems 120 may make bids for the advertising space associated with the advertising space auction. In an example advertising space auction, the advertising platform 140 receives an initial bid for the auction from the advertising system 130 on behalf of the merchant system 120 via the network 150. In this example embodiment, the advertising system 130 also receives initial bids from other advertising systems 130 and/or merchant systems 120. The advertising platform 140, in this example embodiment, may transmit notifications of progress of the auction to the parties from whom it received bids, including the advertising system 130. In this example embodiment, if a threshold amount of time passes and the advertising platform 140 receives no subsequent bids from any advertising systems 130 and/or merchant systems 120, the advertising platform 140 determines that the advertising system 130 and/or merchant system 120 that submitted the highest initial bid is the winner of the advertising space auction. In this example embodiment, the advertising platform transmits a notification of a completed auction to the advertising systems 130 and/or merchant systems 120 from whom it received initial bids via the network 150.
-
In another example embodiment, the advertising platform receives subsequent bids from one or more advertising systems 130 and/or merchant systems 120, including the advertising system 130, via the network 150. In an example embodiment, the advertising platform 140 continues to receive subsequent bids from one or more advertising systems 130 and/or merchant systems 130 until the advertising platform 140 receives no new subsequent bids for a threshold amount of time. In this example embodiment, the advertising platform 140 may continue to transmit notifications of the progress of the auction from the parties from whom it received initial bids and/or subsequent bids. In an example embodiment, after the threshold amount of time passes, the advertising platform 140 determines that the advertising system 130 and/or merchant system 130 that submitted the last bid is the winner of the advertising space auction. In an example embodiment, the advertising platform 140 transmits a notice of completed auction to all advertising systems 130 and/or merchant systems 130 that submitted subsequent bids, including the advertising system 130, via the network 150. In an example embodiment, if the advertising system 130 won the auction, the advertising platform 140 displays the advertisement of the merchant system 120 according to the description of the advertising space in the advertising space auction.

-
FIG. 2 is a block diagram depicting a method 200 for bidding and adjusting bids for advertising spaces based on merchant system availability, in accordance with certain example embodiments. The method 200 is described with reference to the components illustrated in FIG. 1.
-
In block 210, users 101 make reservations with a merchant system 120. The method for making a reservation with a merchant system 120 is described in more detail hereinafter with reference to the method described in FIG. 3.
-
FIG. 3 is a block diagram depicting a method 210 for making a reservation with a merchant system 120, in accordance with certain example embodiments. The method 210 is described with reference to the components illustrated in FIG. 1.
-
In the example embodiments described herein, the merchant system 120 utilizes a merchant system website 127 that users 101 may access to make reservations for services or products of the merchant system 120. In the example embodiments described herein, the merchant system 120 uses the interaction of users 101 with the merchant system reservation website 127 to populate and/or produce a merchant system 120 reservation calendar. In an example embodiment, users 101 may make reservations, change reservations, and/or cancel reservations using the reservation website 127. For example, in changing a reservation the user 101 may change the date of the reservation, change the service or product associated with the reservation, or change other details associated with the reservation. In other example embodiments, the merchant system 120 utilizes another means in addition to or instead of the reservation website 127 to keep track of user 101 reservations and produce a reservation calendar. For example, one or more agents of the merchant system 120 may manually enter user 101 reservations into a merchant system 120 reservation calendar. The method 210 describes an example user 101 interaction with the merchant system reservation website 127.
-
In block 310, a user 101 accesses a merchant system reservation website 127 via a user computing device 110. In an example embodiment, the merchant system website 127 provides an interface wherein the user 101 can make, change, or cancel reservations for goods and services provided by the merchant system 120. In the example embodiments described herein, a “reservation” may refer to a reservation, an order, a booking, a requisition, a commission, a purchase, or any other term that the merchant system 120 may use to describe a setting apart a good or a service for performance or delivery to the user 101 at a time after the reservation is made. In an example embodiment, a reservation may comprise a transaction such as purchase of a good or service for later delivery or performance by the merchant system 120 to the user 101. In another example embodiment, the reservation (the setting apart of the good or service) precedes the transaction. For example, the transaction between the user and the merchant system 120 takes place at the time of performance or delivery.
-
In an example embodiment, the user 101 enters the merchant system reservation website 127 address into the web browser 115 or otherwise accesses the merchant system reservation website 127 via the web browser 115. In an example, the user 101 actuates a user interface 111 object for a merchant system 120 advertisement on the web browser 115 and the web browser 115 redirects to the reservation website 127. In another example embodiment, the user 101 accesses the merchant system reservation website 127 via a merchant application 113 resident on the user computing device 110 that communicates with the merchant system 120 over the network 160. For example, the user 101 downloads the merchant application 113 from the merchant system 120.
-
In block 320, the user 101 selects an option to make a reservation with the merchant system 120. In an example embodiment, the user 101 selects a date and/or time associated with the performance or delivery of service or product of the merchant system 120. For example, the user 101 selects a date and time for a flight, for a catering service, for a doctor's appointment, for a dinner reservation, or for a movie with a relevant merchant system 120 providing the service. In an example embodiment, the user 101 actuates one or more objects on the user interface 111 of the user computing device 110 to communicate to the merchant system 120 reservation website 127 a selection of an option to make a reservation with the merchant system 120. For example, after selecting a date and time for the reservation, the user 101 actuates an object that reads “make reservation” on the reservation website 127 via the user interface 111 of the user computing device 110.

In another example embodiment, the merchant system 120 receives the user 101 reservation by other means and an agent of the merchant system 120 incorporates the user 101 reservation into the reservation calendar. For example, an agent of the merchant system 120 receives a user 101 reservation via telephone, email, text message, or word of mouth, and enters the user 101 reservation into the reservation calendar via a merchant system computing device 121. In the example embodiments described herein, the reservation calendar is electronically accessible by the advertising system 130 over the network 150 and/or the merchant system 120 is able to electronically submit the reservation calendar to the advertising system 130 via the network 150. In an example embodiment, the reservation calendar is a program that executes on the server 125 and/or the reservation website 127.
-
From block 330, the method 210 proceeds to block 220 of FIG. 2.
-
Returning to FIG. 2, in block 220, the merchant system 120 configures advertising bidding preferences with the advertising system 130. The method for configuring bidding preferences with an advertising system 130 is described in more detail hereinafter with reference to the method 220 described in FIG. 4.
-
FIG. 4 is a block diagram depicting a method 220 for configuring bidding preferences with an advertising system 130, in accordance with certain example embodiments. The method 220 is described with reference to the components illustrated in FIG. 1.
-
In the example embodiments described herein, the merchant system 120 transmits bidding preferences to the advertising system 130 comprising an allocation of funds to the advertising system 130, marketing information, and bidding parameters. In the example embodiments described herein, the advertising system 130 makes bids, based on the bidding preferences, on behalf of the merchant system 120 for advertising space auctions with an advertising platform 140. An example advertising space auction comprises an auction for an advertising space with an advertising platform 140, such as a website, radio station, television program, newspaper, magazine, or user computing device 110 application. In an example advertising space auction, one or more advertising systems 130 make bids to the advertising platform 140 on behalf of merchant systems 120 for the advertising space.
-
In block 410, the merchant system 120 allocates funds to the advertising system 130. In an example embodiment, the merchant system 120 transmits an allocation of funds to the advertising system 130 for a certain amount of time. For example, the merchant system 120 allocates five thousand dollars to the advertising system 130 for one month for advertising purposes. In an example embodiment, the advertising system 130 may spend up to the allocated amount for advertising space auctions with one or more advertising platforms 140. In another example embodiment, the advertising system 130 may spend up to the allocated amount in one advertising space auction with an advertising platform 140.
-
In block 420, the merchant system 120 transmits marketing information to the advertising system 130. In an example embodiment, marketing information comprises an average length of time before performance or delivery by the merchant system 120 that a user 101 makes a reservation with the merchant system 120. In the example embodiments described herein, the phrase “ahead of time” refers to the length of time before performance of service or delivery of product by the merchant system 120. In an example embodiment, the marketing data may reveal that users 101 make a reservation for a service or product merchant system 120 an average of two weeks ahead of time. For example, the average user 101 may purchase a ticket for a flight an average of one week ahead of the actual day of the flight. In an example embodiment, the marketing data may provide statistical data in addition to or instead of the average length of time before performance or delivery that users 101 make reservations to the merchant system 120. For example, the statistical data may statistically stratify users 101 into categories or comprise a histogram. For example, the marketing statistical data shows that 25% of users 101 purchase a ticket more than two months ahead of time, 30% of users 101 purchase a ticket between two months and two weeks ahead of time, 25% of users 101 purchase a ticket between two weeks and two days ahead of time, and 20% of users 101 purchase a ticket two days ahead of time or later. In the example embodiments described herein, marketing data assists the advertising system 130 in determining an appropriate bid for an advertising space auction.
-
In block 430, the merchant system 130 defines bidding parameters. In an example embodiment, the bidding parameters comprise a minimum threshold bid and a maximum threshold bid for an advertising space auction. For example, the minimum threshold bid comprises the minimum bid that the advertising system 130 can make for an advertising space auction and the maximum threshold bid comprises the maximum bid that the advertising system 130 can make for the advertising space auction. In this example, the minimum and maximum threshold bids may vary depending on the type of advertising space for which the advertising system 130 is bidding. For example, the minimum threshold bid for a radio time slot may be higher than for an advertising space on a website. In an example embodiment, the bidding parameters may comprise a threshold change in merchant system 120 availability required for an increase or decrease in the bid of a certain amount. For example, the bidding parameters state that for every increase of merchant availability of five percent, the advertising system 130 should decrease the bid in the advertising space auction by ten dollars. In the example embodiments described herein, the advertising system 130 determines merchant system 120 availability based on a merchant system 120 reservation calendar.
-
In block 440, the advertising system 130 receives merchant system 120 bidding preferences. In an example embodiment, the advertising system 130 receives one or more of an allocation of funds, marketing information, and bidding parameters over the network 150 as described herein. In another example embodiment, the advertising system 130 further receives other bidding preferences from the merchant system 120 that the advertising system 130 may take into account when determining bids for an advertising space auction. For example, the merchant system 120 may specify an advertising strategy or a preference or ranking for certain types of advertising spaces.
-
In block 450, the merchant system 120 allows the advertising system 130 access to the merchant system 120 reservation calendar. In the example embodiments described herein, the reservation calendar is electronically accessible by the advertising system 130 over the network 150. In other example embodiments, the merchant system 120 periodically, continuously, or in response to receiving a request from the advertising system 120, transmits the reservation calendar to the advertising system 130 via the network 150.
-
From block 450, the method 220 proceeds to block 230, in FIG. 2.
-
Returning to FIG. 2, in block 230, the advertising system 130 configures an initial bid for an advertising space auction. The method for determining an initial bid for an advertising space auction is described in more detail hereinafter with reference to the method 330 described in FIG. 5.
-
FIG. 5 is a block diagram depicting a method 230 for determining an initial bid for an advertising space auction, in accordance with certain example embodiments. The method 230 is described with reference to the components illustrated in FIG. 1.
-
In block 510, an advertising platform 140 transmits a notice of an advertising space auction to the advertising system 130. For example, the advertising platform 140 transmits a notice of an auction for a website advertisement to the advertising system 130 via the network 150. In an example embodiment, the notice of the advertising space auction comprises details associated with the auction. For example, the notice comprises an opening time and a closing time for the auction, a description of the advertising space associated with the auction, a minimum opening bid for the auction, an advertising space auction identifier, and any other relevant or useful information. In an example embodiment, the advertising transmits an advertising space auction identifier along with the initial bid so that the advertising system 140 can associate the initial bid with the appropriate advertising space auction. The description of the advertising space may comprise details concerning the location of the advertisement, the time of the advertisement, and/or the duration of the advertisement. For example, the description of the advertising space reads “two minute segment for FM radio station 98.4, Mar. 23, 2015, 06:00-06:02 GMT.” An example advertising space identifier is used by the advertising space platform 140 to identify the advertising space auction. In this example, the advertising system 130 submits bids for the advertising space auction along with the advertising space auction identifier so that the advertising platform 140 can associate the bids with the appropriate auction.
-
In an example, the advertising space auction is provided by a search system advertising platform 140 for a prioritization of the merchant system 120 in search results. In this example, if a Japanese restaurant merchant system 120 wins the auction, the search system advertising platform 140 will prioritize the merchant system 120 in search results to users 101 in a physical proximity to a merchant system 120 location. In this example, a user 101 in a physical proximity to a location of the merchant system 120 searching for “Japanese food” will be more likely to retrieve information associated with the merchant system 120 than if the merchant system 120 does not win the advertising space auction.
-
In another example, the advertising space auction is provided by a website advertising platform 140, a radio advertising platform 140, a television advertising platform 140, a newspaper advertising platform 140, a web application advertising platform 140, an advertising platform 140 associated with the advertising system 130, or any other advertising platform 140. For example, an advertising space auction provided by a website advertising platform is for a pop-up advertisement on a certain website for a certain date. In another example embodiment, the advertising space auction provided by a radio advertising platform 140 is for a two minute segment before a prime time radio program on a certain date.
-
In block 520, the advertising system 130 receives the notice of the advertising space auction. In an example embodiment, the advertising system 130 receives multiple notices associated with multiple corresponding advertising space auctions from one or more advertising platforms 140.
-
In block 530, the advertising system 130 determines merchant system 120 availability via the merchant system 120 reservation calendar. In an example embodiment, the merchant system 120 reservation calendar comprises a total capacity for the services or delivery of products associated with the merchant system 120 as well as reservations associated with users 101 for certain periods of time, for times associated with performance of services, or for shipments associated with certain delivery times. For example, the reservation calendar is a reservation calendar or a shipment calendar. For example, an example restaurant merchant system 120 serves up to 100 customers per hour. In this example, the reservation calendar for the restaurant merchant system 120 may divided into one hour sections. In an example embodiment, the reservation calendar may comprise a total number of reservations listed for each time period on the calendar and the total availability for each time period on the calendar. For example, for 5:00-6:00 p.m. on March 3, the restaurant merchant system 120 reservation calendar lists a capacity of 100 customers, 40 confirmed reservations, and an availability of 60. In an example embodiment, the merchant system 120 may comprise the availability listed as a percentage. For example, the restaurant merchant system 120 reservation calendar lists the availability as 60% for the 5:00-6:00 p.m. time period on March 3. In an example embodiment, the merchant system 120 reservation calendar may comprise other statistics such as a capacity and a percentage of capacity that has been reserved already. For example, the restaurant merchant system 120 reservation calendar lists the capacity as 100 customers and the percentage reserved as 40%.
-
In other example embodiments, the merchant system 120 reservation calendar provides only raw reservation data and the advertising system 130 calculates availability and any other useful or relevant statistics based on the raw data. In this example embodiment, the raw data associated with the reservation calendar may comprise a total capacity for the services or delivery of products associated with the merchant system 120 as well as reservations associated with users 101 for certain periods of time, for times associated with performance of services, or for shipments associated with certain delivery times. For example, a theatrical performance of a merchant system 120 at a 5:00 p.m. performance time on March 5 has a capacity of 1,500 viewers and 500 tickets have been purchased. In this example, the reservation calendar lists the capacity as 1,500 and lists 500 reservations associated with the 5:00 p.m., March 5 performance.
-
In an example embodiment, the merchant system 120 updates the reservation calendar each time a new reservation is made or an existing reservation is cancelled, withdrawn, or changed. For example, the reservation calendar may be automatically updated each time a customer user 101 of the merchant system 120 interacts with the merchant system website 127 to make a new reservation or to cancel or modify an existing reservation. In another example embodiment, the merchant system 120 periodically updates the reservation calendar to reflect new, cancelled, withdrawn, or changed reservations. For example, the merchant system 120 updates the reservation calendar every 30 seconds.
-
In block 540, the advertising system 130 determines an initial bid for the auction based on merchant system 120 availability and bidding preferences. In an example embodiment, the merchant system 120 bidding preferences comprise an allocation of funds to the advertising system 130, marketing information, and bidding parameters.
-
In an example embodiment, the advertising system 130 determines availability based on the merchant system 120 reservation calendar. For example, the merchant system 120 reservation calendar comprises availability data. In an example embodiment, the advertising system 130 determines availability data from raw data in the reservation calendar. In an example embodiment, the reservation calendar comprises a data record for each day the merchant system 120 operates. In an example, the data record for each day may be subdivided into periods of time, for example, 24 one-hour intervals or 96 fifteen-minute intervals. For example, each period of time in the reservation calendar may comprise a capacity to provide services, products, or deliveries as well as confirmed reservations for those services, products, or deliveries. For example, the capacity is the maximum amount of services that the merchant may provide during the time period. For example, if a restaurant can seat fifty people in a one hour time period, then the capacity of the restaurant is fifty. In an example embodiment, the merchant system 120 determines availability for each time period in the merchant system 120 reservation calendar by subtracting the corresponding number of reservations from the corresponding capacity listed under the time period. For example, if a restaurant has a capacity to seat fifty people between 2:00-3:00 p.m. and there are 30 reservations, the availability for the time period is 20. In an example embodiment, the advertising system 130 determines availability as a proportion by dividing the availability by the capacity. For example, if the capacity is 1000 seats at a theatre and the availability is 200 seats, then the availability as a proportion is 200/1000 (0.2).
-
In another example embodiment, the merchant system 120 reservation calendar comprises, for each time period for which the merchant system 120 provides services, a certain number of empty fields equal to the capacity of the merchant system 120. In this example embodiment, when a user confirms a reservation via the merchant system 120 reservation website for a time period or when an agent associated with the merchant system 120 manually adds a reservation to the time period, one of the empty fields is marked as reserved. In this example embodiment, the advertising system 130 determines the availability for the time period by determining the number of remaining empty fields. In another example embodiment, the advertising system 130 divides the number of empty fields by the total number of fields to determine an availability proportion.
-
In an example embodiment, the advertising system 130 determines the initial bid based at least in part on bidding parameters and the availability. Example bidding parameters comprise a low bidding threshold, a high bidding threshold, and acceptable bidding intervals according to availability. For example, in the bidding parameters, the merchant system 120 may define $1.00 as a low bidding threshold for a 24 hour advertising space on a website and $100.00 as the high bidding threshold. In this example, the merchant system may define $1.00 as an acceptable bid when the merchant is at 100% availability and $100.00 as an acceptable bid when the merchant system is at 0% availability. In this example, the merchant system may instruct the advertising system to increase the bid for the advertising space by $1.00 or for each decrease in availability of 1% and decrease the bid for the advertising space by $1.00 for each increase in the availability of 1%. For example, if the current bid was $40.00 and the availability decreased by 5%, the bidding parameters would instruct the advertising system 130 to increase the bid by $5.00 to $45.00. In another example embodiment, the bidding parameters may instruct the advertising system to further increase or decrease the bid for the advertising space based on the transmitted marketing preferences. For example, if the marketing information shows that most customers wait until a few days ahead of time to make a reservation or purchase a service from a merchant system, the merchant system may instruct the advertising system to make low bids when the advertising time slot is two weeks ahead of time, even if the availability is low. Alternatively, if the marketing data shows that few customers wait until a few days ahead of time to make a reservation or purchase a service from a merchant system, the merchant system may instruct the advertising system to make high bids when the advertising time slot is two weeks ahead of time, even if the availability is high. The bid amounts based on the bidding preferences, including an allocation of funds to the advertising system 130, marketing information, and bidding parameters, can be configured by the advertising system operator or the merchant system operator to achieve a desired increase/decrease of bid amount based on, for example, availability and time to service availability.
-
The advertising system receives the merchant system bidding preferences. In an example embodiment, the merchant system bidding preferences comprise the allocated funds, the marketing information, and the bidding parameters.
-
In an example embodiment, the advertising system 130 determines the initial bid based at least in part, in addition to the availability and bidding parameters, on the marketing data. In an example embodiment, the merchant system transmits statistics concerning the merchant system or the industry associated with the merchant system 120. In an example embodiment, marketing information comprises an average or median length of time before performance or delivery by the merchant system 120 that a user 101 makes a reservation with the merchant system 120. For example, the average customer makes a reservation four days ahead of the performance of a service by the merchant system 120 or the delivery of a product. In an example embodiment, the merchant system 120 transmits marketing data comprising statistics that show that 25% of customers reserve a service between a month ahead of performance and two weeks ahead of performance, 50% of customers reserve a service within two weeks ahead of performance and two days ahead of performance, and 25% of customers reserve a service within two days ahead of performance and the time of performance of service.
-
In an example embodiment, the advertising system 130 determines a higher initial bid when the marketing data show that advertising will be more effective and determines a lower initial bid when the marketing data show that advertising will be less effective. For example, the marketing data show that 25% of customers reserve a service between a month ahead of performance and two weeks ahead of performance, 50% of customers reserve a service within two weeks ahead of performance and two days ahead of performance, and 25% of customers reserve a service within two days ahead of performance and the time of performance of service. In this example, the advertising system 130 makes a lower bid for an advertising space that is three weeks ahead of performance, in which up to 25% of customers are likely to reserve the service, than it would make for the same or a similar advertising space between two weeks ahead of performance and two days ahead of performance, in which 50% of customers are likely to reserve the service. In an example embodiment, the degree to which the marketing data affect the determination of a bid by the advertising system 130 is configurable by the merchant system 120 and/or advertising system 130.
-
In block 550, the advertising system 130 transmits the initial bid on behalf of the merchant system 120 to the advertising platform 140. In an example embodiment, the advertising system 130 transmits the initial bid via the network 150.
-
In block 560, the advertising platform 140 receives the initial bid from the advertising system 130. In an example embodiment, the advertising platform 140 receives one or more additional bids from one or more other advertising systems 130 and/or merchant systems 120 for the same advertising space auction.
-
From block 560, the method 230 proceeds to block 240, in FIG. 2.
-
Returning to FIG. 2, in block 240, the advertising platform 140 transmits notification of progress of the auction to the advertising system 130. In an example embodiment, the notification of progress of the auction comprises a notification that the auction is still in progress. In another example embodiment, the notification comprises a notification that the auction is finished and that the merchant system 120 won the auction. In yet another example embodiment, the notification comprises a notification that the auction is finished and that the merchant system 120 did not win the auction. In an example embodiment, the advertising platform 140 transmits the notification of progress of the auction to the advertising system 130 via the network 150.
-
In block 250, the advertising system 130 receives the notification of progress of the auction. For example, the advertising system 130 receives the notification of progress of the auction via the network 150.
-
In block 260, the advertising system 130 determines if the auction is complete based on the received notification of progress. In an example embodiment, the notification of the progress of the auction comprises an indication as to whether the auction is complete or not.
-
If the auction is complete, the method 200 proceeds to block 280. For example, the advertising system 130 receives, from the advertising platform 140, a notification of progress of the auction that informs the advertising system 130 that the auction is complete.
-
In block 280, the advertising system 130 transmits a notice to the merchant system 120. In an example embodiment, the notice informs the merchant system 120 either that the merchant system 120 has won the auction or that the merchant system 120 has not won the auction.
-
Returning to block 260, if the auction is not complete, the method 200 proceeds to block 270.
-
In block 270, the advertising system 130 adjusts the bid for the auction based on updated merchant system 120 availability data. The method for adjusting a bid for an advertising space auction based on merchant system 120 availability is described in more detail hereinafter with reference to the method 270 described in FIG. 6.
-
FIG. 6 is a block diagram depicting a method 270 for adjusting a bid for an advertising space auction based on merchant system 120 availability, in accordance with certain example embodiments. The method 270 is described with reference to the components illustrated in FIG. 1.
-
In block 610, the advertising system 130 receives an updated merchant system 120 reservation calendar. In an example embodiment, the availability of the merchant system 120 changes at a time after the advertising system 130 receives or accesses the first merchant system 120 reservation calendar. For example, at the time the advertising system 130 receives a first merchant system 120 reservation calendar from a restaurant merchant system 120 having a capacity of 100 tables, the restaurant has an availability of 30% (30 tables available out of 100) between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. for a certain date. In this example, at a time after the advertising system 130 receives the first reservation calendar, customers reserve five more tables (5% of capacity) for the same date for the period between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., decreasing the availability from 30% to 25%. In another example embodiment, the availability of the merchant system 120 does not change from the time the advertising system 130 receives the first reservation calendar until the time the advertising system 130 receives the updated merchant system 120 reservation calendar. For example, no new reservations are made and no reservations are withdrawn or cancelled. In another example, the same number of reservations are cancelled as the number of reservations that are added during this time period between the first and updated reservation calendars.
-
In block 620, the advertising system 130 determines a new bid based on the merchant system 120 bidding preferences. In an example embodiment, the advertising system 130 uses the same criteria to determine the new bid as it used to determine the initial bid. For example, the advertising system 130 determines the new bid based at least in part on bidding parameters, the availability based on the updated reservation calendar, and the marketing information.
-
In block 630, the advertising system 130 determines whether the determined new bid is different from the initial bid. In an example embodiment, the new bid is the same amount as the initial bid. In another example embodiment, the new bid is higher or lower than the initial bid. In an example embodiment, the advertising system 130 determines a higher new bid than initial bid if the availability increases relative to the availability associated with the first merchant system 120 reservation calendar. In this example embodiment, the advertising system 130 determines a lower new bid than initial bid if the availability decreases relative to the availability associated with the first merchant system 120 reservation calendar. In another example embodiment, the advertising system 130 determines a higher or lower bid based on the marketing information. For example, if the marketing information shows that the percentage of customers that reserve a service increases as the day of performance approaches, the advertising system 130 determines a higher value for the new bid than it did for the initial bid. Likewise, in this example, if the marketing information shows that percentage of customers that reserve a service decreases as the day of performance approaches, the advertising system 130 determines a lower value for the new bid than it did for the initial bid.
-
If the new bid is not unchanged from the previous bid, the method 270 proceeds to block 240 in FIG. 2. In an example, the advertising system 130, based on the merchant system 120 reservation calendar, determines that the availability of the merchant system 120 increased since the time the advertising system 130 received the first reservation calendar. In this example, however, the marketing data show that as the day of performance of services of the merchant system 120 approaches, the percentage of users 101 that make reservations for the merchant system 120 service decreases. In this example, based on the combination of change in availability and based on the marketing data, the advertising system 130 determines that the new bid should be the same as the initial bid.
-
Returning to FIG. 2, in block 240, the advertising platform 140 transmits a notification of the progress of the auction to the merchant system 120. In this example embodiment, since the new bid is the same as the initial bid, the advertising system 130 does not need to submit a new bid and may maintain the initial bid. An example notification of the progress of the auction comprises a notice that the auction is still ongoing and a summary of the current state of the bidding in the advertising space auction. In another example, the example notification of the progress of the auction comprises a notice that the auction is finished and that the merchant system 120 won the advertising space auction. In yet another example, the example notification comprises a notice that the auction is finished and that the merchant system 120 did not win the advertising space auction. In yet another example embodiment, no notification of the process of the auction is transmitted if the merchant system 120 does not win the auction. In an example embodiment, the advertising platform 140 transmits the notification of the progress of the auction to the advertising system 130 via the network 150.
-
In an example embodiment, the advertising system 130 receives the notification of the progress of the advertising space auction. For example, the advertising system 130 receives the notification of the progress of the auction via the network 150.
-
In an example embodiment, if the auction is not complete, the method 270 is repeated. In this example embodiment, if the auction is complete, the advertising system transmits notice to the merchant system 120 that the auction is complete.
-
Returning to block 630, in FIG. 6, if the determined new bid is different from the initial bid, the method 270 proceeds to block 640.
-
In block 640, the advertising system 130 transmits the new bid for the auction to the advertising platform 140. In an example embodiment, the advertising system 130 transmits the new bid to the advertising platform via the same means advertising system 130 used to transmit the initial bid to the advertising platform 140. For example, the advertising system 130 transmits the new bid for the auction to the advertising platform 140 via the network 150. In an example embodiment, the advertising transmits an advertising space auction identifier along with the new bid so that the advertising system 140 can associate the new bid with the appropriate advertising space auction. In an example embodiment, the advertising system 130 transmits the new bid to the advertising platform 140 via the network 150. In an example embodiment, the advertising system 130 transmits the advertising space auction identifier, along with the new bid, to the advertising platform 140.
-
In block 650, the advertising platform 140 receives the new bid. For example, the advertising system 140 receives the new bid via the network 150. In an example embodiment, the advertising platform 140 receives the advertising space auction identifier along with the new bid, identifies the appropriate advertising space auction using the advertising space auction identifier, and associates the new bid with the advertising space auction.
-
From block 650, the method 270 proceeds to block 240, in FIG. 2.
-
Returning to FIG. 2, in block 240, the advertising platform 140 transmits notification of the progress of the auction to the advertising system 130.
-
In block 250, the advertising system 130 receives the notification of progress of the auction. For example, the advertising system 130 receives the notification of progress of the auction via the network 150.
-
In block 260, the advertising system 130 determines if the auction is complete. In an example embodiment, the notification of the progress of the auction comprises an indication as to whether the auction is complete or not.
-
If the advertising space auction is not complete, the method 200 proceeds to block 270. In an example embodiment, the method 270 and blocks 240 and 250 of method 200 repeat until the advertising system 130 receives a notification from the advertising platform 140 that the advertising space auction is complete. For example, the advertising system 130 may make more than one subsequent new bid to the advertising platform 140 on behalf of the merchant system 120 for the advertising space auction before receiving a notification from the advertising platform 140 that the auction is closed.
-
Returning to block 260, if the advertising space auction is complete, the method 200 proceeds to block 280.
-
In block 280, the advertising system 130 transmits a notice to the merchant system 120. In an example embodiment, the notice informs the merchant system 120 either that the merchant system 120 has won the auction or that the merchant system 120 has not won the auction.
