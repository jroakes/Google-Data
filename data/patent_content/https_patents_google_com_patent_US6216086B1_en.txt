Definitions
- This invention is directed generally to the field of navigation, and more particularly to a system for vehicle route planning.
- the present invention is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/786,500 AN IMPROVED ACCURACY SENSORY SYSTEM FOR VEHICLE NAVIGATION, Seymour et. al. and to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/786,450 A VEHICLE ROUTE GUIDANCE SYSTEM, Seymour et. al., both of which were filed on the same date herewith and are assigned to the assignee of the present invention.
- Modern vehicular navigation systems combine map databases and dead-reckoning navigation methods with various vehicle route planning schemes in order to route the driver from an initial location to a desired destination location.
- the vehicle route planning scheme typically has access to a network of road segments in a map database. The initial vehicle location and destination vehicle location are specified before the commencement of each trip.
- the vehicle route planning scheme plans the route by concatenating road segments to complete a route.
- Contemporary systems are crisp in nature and do not compensate vehicle route planning for driver preferences such as avoidance of undesired route congestion or the demand for concentration, or concentration intensity, on the driver's part. Also while a route may be the shortest possible, in the case of an emergency, the driver may be better served by taking a longer, faster route.
- a driver may not like to turn left at any intersection on Friday afternoon when traffic is intense. If the driver wanted to take the scenic route there is no provision in contemporary systems to do so. Although these preferences are important to the driver, analytical or crisp methods of route planning are resource prohibitive for a complete solution to be implemented.
- a vehicle route planning system includes a provided trip origin location and a trip destination location and considers first and second routes, taken from a map, between the trip origin location and the trip destination location and includes first and second attributes and determined driver preferences in a model free selection of a preferred route.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of a navigation computer with fuzzy inferencing providing a physical platform, as described in a preferred embodiment.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a fuzzy set describing Congestion as described in a preferred embodiment.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a fuzzy set describing Concentration Intensity, as described in a preferred embodiment.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a fuzzy set describing Travel Time difference, as described in a preferred embodiment.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a table of driver preferences, or tolerances, for a variety of trip scenarios, as described in a preferred embodiment.
- FIG. 6 illustrates a table of truth values, for a variety of route scenarios, as described in a preferred embodiment.
- FIG. 7 illustrates an inference table for Rule A from TABLE 1, for a variety of route scenarios, as described in a preferred embodiment.
- FIG. 8 illustrates an inference table for Rule B from TABLE 1, for a variety of route scenarios, as described in a preferred embodiment.
- FIG. 9 illustrates an inference table for Rule C from TABLE 1, for a variety of route scenarios, as described in a preferred embodiment.
- FIG. 10 illustrates an inference table for Rule D from TABLE 1, for a variety of route scenarios, as described in a preferred embodiment.
- FIG. 11 illustrates a table for final blending and Selection or Exclusion of routes based on truth values, as described in a preferred embodiment.
- the route attributes are represented in a digital map database that includes congested travel time and uncongested travel time and can include historical route congestion, and concentration intensity.
- the driver preferences are defined by the vehicle driver and include, driver tolerance to congestion, driver tolerance to concentration intensity and a parameter describing a trip's emergency. Alternatively these driver preferences can be provided by historical data, or derived from past driving habits, or defined by other people.
- the route attributes and driver preferences are all coupled to a navigation computer with a model free mechanism, in this case a fuzzy inferencing engine, designed to select a most convenient, or preferred, route.
- model free means such as a neural network, genetic learning method, or other model derivable from observations directly rather than by analytical methods.
- a model free means is a technique for estimating input-output functions, or stimulus-response associations based on a non-analytic means.
- the preferred embodiment applies fuzzy inferencing, based on fuzzy sets, as described by Lotfi Zadah in his landmark treatise “Fuzzy Sets”, published in Information and Control, Vol. 8, pages 338-353, by the Academic Press, 1965.
- FIG. 1 we illustrate a physical platform for the navigation computer with fuzzy inferencing 101 , by applying a MVME147SA-2 VME computer board, available from Motorola Inc., Microcomputer Division Marketing Department, MS DW283, 2900 South Diablo Way, Tempe, Ariz. 850282.
- This single board computer, or CPU 103 has a 32 Mhz 68030 with a 68882 floating point coprocessor, 32 Mb of DRAM, and a battery backed real time clock calendar.
- a VME bus 105 is a conduit applied to couple various other functions to the CPU 103 .
- Other microprocessor types and platforms are suitable for this task as well.
- the CDROM 107 reads a map database from an optical disk. Henceforth the combination of the CDROM and the map database will be referred to as a map database and by denoted by 107 .
- a data radio 135 to the CPU 103 , via an RS-232C link 133 , as an alternative, or additional mechanism for receiving route attribute information such as active traffic information.
- This radio 135 is the Coverage Plus Simplex 35 Watt Radio, Model Number D45AHA5GB1AK, available from Motorola, Inc. Communications Sector 1303 Algonquin Road, Schaumburg, Ill. 60196.
- This radio 135 communicates with the base station system 139 , via airwaves 137 .
- the base station system 139 broadcasts relevant route attribute information, such as traffic congestion to the data radio 135 .
- other data radio's and systems such as the European Radio Data Service, and other Traffic Information Center infrastructures can be applied.
- a portable PC, or laptop computer 131 is coupled to the CPU 103 through an RS-232C port, 129 .
- This laptop computer 131 is applied to receive input from the vehicle operator, or driver, and display relevant navigation information.
- An Apple Macintosh PowerBook 170 available from Apple Computer Inc., 20525 Mariani Avenue, Cupertino, Calif. 95014 is applied. It's interesting to note that given the laptop computer as an input mechanism, the driver can receive traffic congestion information from a voice radio, or observation, and enter it into the system to augment other route attribute information.
- the CPU 103 runs the compiled inferencing software developed on an IBM PC host computer using software available from Togai Infralogic, Inc. 30 Corporate Park, Suite 107 Irvine, Calif. 92714. This software is titled the Fuzzy C development system. Once the fuzzy sets, defined by membership functions, and fuzzy rules are derived using the IBM PC host, the output of the Fuzzy C development system is a standard ANSI C source code. This source code is then compiled by using the M68NNTBGHC SYSTEM V/68 GREEN HILLS C-68000 Compiler, available from Motorola Inc., Microcomputer Division Marketing Department, MS DW283, 2900 South Diablo Way, Tempe, Ariz. 850282. The output of the compiler is then loaded onto the CPU 103 for application execution. Of course, other embedded software emulations can be used.
- fuzzy inferencing system platforms include fuzzy microcontroller circuits, fuzzy coprocessors, analog computational circuits, digital computer circuits, optical computers, spatial light modulators and holograms to name a few.
- the laptop computer 131 is the mechanism by which the driver inputs the trip origin and trip destination information as well as driver preference information.
- the navigation computer with fuzzy inferencing 101 reads the trip origin location and trip destination location from the laptop computer 131 .
- the navigation computer with fuzzy inferencing 101 next queries the map database 107 seeking out all the possible routes between the trip origin and the trip destination.
- the route attributes are represented in a digital map database that includes congested travel time and uncongested travel time and can include historical route congestion, and concentration intensity.
- other attributes can be assigned to the routes in the map database 107 .
- route attributes can be important to the preferences selected by a specific driver.
- route attributes such as congestion and or concentration intensity have historically pre-estimated values stored in the map database. Alternatively these attributes can be updated at run time through the data radio 135 and base station 39 .
- the driver inputs his preferences on the laptop computer 131 for the various categories illustrated including tolerance to congestion, tolerance to concentration intensity and emergency trip. Of course, other attributes as described before can be of interest to the driver and input at this time.
- the driver inputs a number between zero and 10 indicating his preference. For the case of Trip 1 501 , the driver has selected a congestion tolerance of 10, 503 . This means that the driver has a high tolerance to congestion. The driver has selected a zero tolerance to concentration intensity 505 , and a zero value for emergency trip 507 .
- Trip 2 509 As we continue our description, we will employ Trip 2 509 and its attendant driver preferences while considering our example of route selection.
- FIG. 6 we illustrate various attributes for the three routes found in the map database 107 for our trip example. Some of these attributes are truth values from fuzzy sets and some are computed. Considering Route 1 601 , when the map database 107 is queried, it returns an average vehicle density attribute of 1.5, 603 . Turning to FIG. 2, we find a fuzzy set describing the universe of discourse for all congestion attributes.
- the map database 107 When queried, the map database 107 also provided a historically average value for uncongested travel time of 8 minutes 605 and the historically average congested travel time 16 minutes, 611 .
- the navigation computer with fuzzy inferencing 101 After classifying the route attributes and the driver preferences into the fuzzy sets, yielding the truth values illustrated in FIG. 6, the navigation computer with fuzzy inferencing 101 next selects at least one fuzzy rule from TABLE 1.
- Rule A of TABLE 1 further illustrated in the form of a fuzzy inferencing table in FIG. 7, we consider the first antecedent clause 701 , and whether or not the compared routes 703 select this clause 701 .
- no two routes are not fully Congested, and therefore, this clause does not fire, resulting in zero truth values 705 .
- the consequence clause 707 also yields zero truth values 709 .
- Rule B illustrated in fuzzy inferencing table in FIG. 8 .
- antecedent clause 2 of Rule B 801 has a truth value of 0.8, 803 .
- This truth value 803 is retrieved from the table in FIG. 6 as the Not Very Congested truth value of Route 2 0.8, 621 .
- antecedent clause 1 805 yields a zero value from the table in FIG. 6 as a Very Congested truth value for Route 1.
- the consequence clause 807 also has a zero truth value as the minimum of zero 813 , and 0.8 803 , is zero, 809 .
- the fuzzy inferencing table in FIG. 8 is then completed as described earlier.
- CTT x is the Congested Travel Time for the not congested route in the antecedent clause 2 in Rule C
- UCTT x is the Uncongested Travel Time for the not congested route in the antecedent clause 2 in Rule C
- C x is the Congestion truth value for the not congested route in the antecedent clause 2 in Rule C
- CTT y is the Congested Travel Time for the the congested route in the antecedent clause 1 in Rule C
- UCTT y is the is the Uncongested Travel Time the congested route in the antecedent clause 1 in Rule C
- C y is the Congestion truth value for the congested route in the antecedent clause 1 in Rule C
- fuzzy Rule D from TABLE 1 illustrated in fuzzy inferencing table format. This table was filled out in the same manner as the tables illustrated in FIGS. 7, 8 , and 9 , by classifying the fuzzy variable into the appropriate fuzzy set.
- the table in FIG. 11, illustrates the blending process chosen for the preferred embodiment.
- Rule A in FlG. 7 yielded a zero truth value for Selecting Route 1 711 713 .
- Rule B in FIG. 8 also yielded a zero truth value for Selecting Route 1 809 811 .
- Fuzzy Rule C also yielded zero truth values for Route 1 911 913 .
- Fuzzy Rule D yields a Select Consequence truth value of 0.4 1001 , and a Select Consequence truth value of 0.4, 1003 .
- the Congested attribute from the map database 107 we used the Congested attribute from the map database 107 .
- Various driver attributes including tolerance to congestion, tolerance to concentration intensity, and emergency trip, all provided by the driver through the laptop computer 131 .
- FIG. 3 we illustrate a fuzzy set describing the universe of discourse for the Concentration Intensity route attribute.
- TABLE 2 we introduce a fuzzy rule set considering concentration intensity as a route attribute. Considering these rules and sets will further refine the convenience of the route selection process.
