Definitions
- the invention relates to document searching and retrieval, particularly over networks.
- a searcher is able to apply a query to one or to a plurality of databases.
- the searcher selects individual databases which are of interest, based on past experience, or selects a group of databases, selected by the information provider and related to a particular topic. For example, a searcher might select the topic of patents, a topic for which the information service has grouped a number of databases specific to patents.
- the information service retrieves the number of hits in each database. The searcher then accesses databases of interest to view individual records. This system was originally designed for librarians and professional researchers who know where to look for desired information.
- documents can be ranked by search engines in accord with an algorithm and given a weight, taking into account the nature of a particular collection.
- Document scores can be normalized to obtain scores that would be obtained if individual document collections were merged into a single, unified collection.
- a second problem which exists is that the standard prior art procedure requires two passes. In a first pass, statistics are collected from each search engine in order to compute the weight for each query term. In a second step, the information from the first step is passed back to each search engine, which then assigns a particular weight or score to each hit or identified document.
- a third problem that exists is that the prior art requires that all collections use the same search engine.
- An object of the invention was to devise a method for searching multiple collections on a single pass, with ranking of documents on a consistent basis so that if the same document appears in two different databases, it would be scored the same when the results are merged. It is not required that the same search engine be used for all collections.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of the system of the present invention.
- a query is formulated by a user and applied to a terminal or client system.
- the query is electronically transmitted to a network interface 13.
- the network interface is an information service which has access to sources 17 having databases relating to the subject of the query. These databases, mounted on other servers, are simultaneously polled over communications channels 15, which may be wide area network links to the sources 17.
- the Internet is a model for such an arrangement of wide area network links and remote sources.
- the query is applied to search engines, represented by columns 20, 30, and 40, with each search engine accessing an associated database in block 19. Each search engine may have its own operating characteristics, such as Boolean logic, statistical inferences, etc.
- Each database produces a report containing the number of records, N, in the database, indicated by block 21.
- N TERM the number of times each search term occurs in documents responsive to the query. This quantity, N TERM , is indicated by block 23.
- Computed scores are transmitted to an output buffer, indicated by block 29, which sifts the top M scores from computation block 27, which have been requested by the person making the query. Note that only a single pass has been made through the database. Computed scores are treated as absolute values.
- an optional parameter may be reported for use in the algorithm.
- Block 26 shows that the frequency of the most frequent term in each document is reported for purposes of using a more sophisticated ranking formula of the client.
- Another optional data reduction step is that each search engine may compute a score for document relevance in the manner known in the prior art. From this data, the search engine may preselect up to the top M hits in the database, where M is a maximum number of hits required by the user.
- a search query might involve documents with the words "graphical user-interface".
- Table 1 shows a report generated by a search engine which has selected a number of the highest ranking documents. This report is returned to the user's client software, where the user applies an algorithm, such as in formula (1) above, using term frequency data and document frequency data returned by each search engine.
- an algorithm such as in formula (1) above, using term frequency data and document frequency data returned by each search engine.
