Definitions
- Information retrieval systems i.e., search systems
- recommendation systems are widely integrated and used by most websites and digital content stores.
- An information retrieval system uses terms and phrases to index, retrieve, organize and describe documents.
- search queries When a user enters a search query, the terms in the query are identified and used to retrieve documents from the information retrieval system, and then rank them.
- search systems are rarely personalized and provide the same search results to all users.
- recommendation systems provide recommendations primarily based on the individual items that a user has previously purchased/browsed.
- a system and/or method is provided for determining media consumption preferences, substantially as shown in and/or described in connection with at least one of the figures, as set forth more completely in the claims.
- a method for determining media consumption preferences may include accessing media consumption history associated with a user.
- the media consumption history may include at least one of media purchase history of the user and media viewing history of the user.
- a media category preference of the user may be determined, based on the media consumption history.
- the media category preference may include a popularity indication for each of a plurality of media categories of media items in the media consumption history. Search results provided in response to a search query by the user and/or media recommendations prepared for the user may be scored based on the media category preference.
- a method for determining media consumption preferences may include accessing media consumption history associated with a user.
- the media consumption history may include at least one of media purchase history of the user and media viewing history of the user.
- a media language preference of the user may be determined, based on the media consumption history.
- the media language preference may include a popularity indication for each of a plurality of languages of the media items in the media consumption history. Search results provided in response to a search query by the user and/or media recommendations prepared for the user may be scored based on the media language preference.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example language preference extraction system, in accordance with an example embodiment of the disclosure.

- circuits and “circuitry” refer to physical electronic components (i.e. hardware) and any software and/or firmware (“code”) which may configure the hardware, be executed by the hardware, and or otherwise be associated with the hardware.
- code software and/or firmware
- x and/or y means any element of the three-element set ⁇ (x), (y), (x, y) ⁇ .
- x, y, and/or z means any element of the seven-element set ⁇ (x), (y), (z), (x, y), (x, z), (y, z), (x, y, z) ⁇ .
- the term “e.g.,” introduces a list of one or more non-limiting examples, instances, or illustrations.
- the term “corpus” means a collection of documents (or data items) of a given type.
- the term “WWW-based search corpora” or “WWW-based corpora” is corpora meant to include all documents available on the Internet (i.e., including, but not limited to, music-related documents, book-related documents, movie-related documents and other media-related documents).
- the term “non-WWW corpus” or “non WWW-based corpus” means a corpus where the corpus documents (or data items) are not available on the WWW.
- small corpora may indicate corpora including at least one corpus that is a subset of the WWW-based (or web-based) corpora, or at least one corpus that is partially or completely non-overlapping with the web-based corpora.
- An example of “small” corpora may include corpora associated with an online media search engine.
- the “small” corpora may include, for example, a movie corpus (associated with a movie search engine), music corpus (associated with a music search engine), etc.
- portions of the music and/or movies database may be available via an Internet search of the WWW-based corpora (i.e., such portions of the respective corpus are a subset of the WWW-based corpora), while other portions of the “small” corpora may not be available on the WWW-based corpora and are, therefore, non-overlapping with the WWW-based corpora.
- non-overlapping corpus e.g., a first corpus is non-overlapping with a second corpus
- media or “digital media” refers to any type of digital media documents (or items) available for purchase/download and consumption by a user.
- digital media include videos, movies, TV shows, books, magazines, newspapers, audio recordings, music albums, comics, and other digital media.
- a preference extraction system may initially determine a user's category/genre preferences and/or language preferences (or any other type of preferences associated with consumption of digital media). The extracted data may then be used in information retrieval and/or personalized recommendation systems for personalizing the results presented to a user.
- a user who searches for “free games” may be presented with results for “board games” if their past purchases show an interest in board games.
- a user who searches for “action movies” may be presented with results showing action movies which also have a bit of romance, if the user has a history of liking romantic films as well (e.g., based on previous viewing history).
- a user who searches for “foreign films” may be presented with results for Russian films if their past digital media purchases show interest in media presented in Russian.
