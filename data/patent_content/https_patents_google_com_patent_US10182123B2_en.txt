- a computing device can access a resource for display, such as a webpage, a document, an application or a geographic map, for example.
- the computing device can access the resource via the Internet by communicating with a server, such as a webpage server, corresponding to that resource.
- the resource can include first-party content that is the subject of the resource from a first-party content provider and may also include additional third-party provided content, such as advertisements or other content.
- a webpage server or a client device can communicate with a data processing system, such as a content item selection system, to request a content item to be presented with a requested webpage, such as through the execution of code of the resource to request a third-party content item to be presented with the resource.
- the data processing system can select a third-party content item and provide data to effect presentation of the content item with the requested webpage on a display of the client device.
- the content item is selected and served with a resource associated with a search query response.
- a search engine may return search results on a search results webpage and may include third-party content items related to the search query in one or more content item slots of the search results webpage.
- the computing device may also be used to view or execute an application, such as a mobile application.
- the application may include first-party content that is the subject of the application from a first-party content provider and may also include additional third-party provided content, such as advertisements or other content.
- a resource server or a client device can communicate with a data processing system, such as a content item selection system, to request a content item to be presented with a user interface of the application or otherwise.
- the data processing system can select a third-party content item and provide data to effect presentation of the content item with the application on a display of the client device.
- a device identifier may be associated with the client device.
- the device identifier may be a randomized or pseudo-randomized number associated with the client device to identify the device during subsequent requests for resources or content items.
- the device identifier can store or cause the client device to transmit information related to the client device to the data processing system or resource server (e.g., values of sensor data, a web browser type, an operating system, historical resource requests, historical content item requests, etc.).
- the users can be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
- a third-party content provider when providing third-party content items for presentation with requested resources via the Internet or other network, may utilize a content item management service to control or otherwise influence the selection and serving of the third-party content items.
- a third-party content provider may specify selection criteria (such as keywords) and corresponding bid values that are used in the selection of the third-party content items.
- the bid values may be utilized by the data processing system in an auction to select and serve content items for presentation with a resource.
- a third-party content provider may place a bid in the auction that corresponds to an agreement to pay a certain amount of money if a user interacts with the provider's content item (e.g., the provider agrees to pay $3 if a user clicks on the provider's content item).
- a third-party content provider may place a bid in the auction that corresponds to an agreement to pay a certain amount of money if the content item is selected and served (e.g., the provider agrees to pay $0.005 each time a content item is selected and served or the provider agrees to pay $0.05 each time a content item is selected or clicked).
- the data processing system uses content item interaction data to determine the performance of the third-party content provider's content items. For example, users may be more inclined to click on third-party content items on certain webpages over others. Accordingly, auction bids to place the third-party content items may be higher for high-performing webpages, categories of webpages, or other criteria, while the bids may be lower for low-performing webpages, categories of webpages, or other criteria.
- one or more performance metrics for the third-party content items may be determined and indications of such performance metrics may be provided to the third-party content provider via a user interface for the content item management account.
- the performance metrics may include a cost per impression (CPI) or cost per thousand impressions (CPM), where an impression may be counted, for example, whenever a content item is selected to be served for presentation with a resource.
- the performance metric may include a click-through rate (CTR), defined as the number of clicks on the content item divided by the number of impressions.
- CTR click-through rate
- CPA cost per action
- CVR conversion rate
- CPC cost per click-through
- CPS cost per sale
- CPL cost per lead
- eCPM effective CPM
- a webpage or other resource (such as, for example, an application) includes one or more content item slots in which a selected and served third-party content item may be displayed.
- the code e.g., JavaScript®, HTML, etc.
- defining a content item slot for a webpage or other resource may include instructions to request a third-party content item from the data processing system to be presented with the webpage.
- the selection of a third-party content item to be served with the resource by a data processing system may be based on several influencing factors, such as a predicted click through rate (pCTR), a predicted conversion rate (pCVR), a bid associated with the content item, etc.
- influencing factors may be used to generate a value, such as a score, against which other scores for other content items may be compared by the data processing system through an auction.
- an auction may include bids based on whether a user clicks on the third-party content item, whether a user performs a specific action based on the presentation of the third-party content item, whether the third-party content item is selected and served, or other types of bids.
- a bid based on whether the third-party content item is selected and served may be a lower bid (e.g., $0.005) while a bid based on whether a user performs a specific action may be a higher bid (e.g., $5).
- the bid may be adjusted to account for a probability associated with the type of bid or adjusted for other reasons.
- the probability of the user performing the specific action may be low, such as 0.2%, while the probability of the selected and served third-party content item may be 100% (e.g., the selected and served content item will occur if it is selected during the auction, so the bid is unadjusted).
- a value such as a score or a normalized value, may be generated to be used in the auction based on the bid value and the probability or another modifying value.
- the data processing system may select the third-party content item with the highest value from the auction.
- the data processing system may select the content item associated with the bid based on whether the user performs the specific action due to the higher value or score associated with that bid.
- a third-party content item is selected by the data processing system, data to effect presentation of the third-party content item on a display of the client device may be provided to the client device using a network.
- product item is used interchangeably to refer to a physical product item or electronic content (such as text, image, video or a combination thereof) associated with (or indicative of) a corresponding physical product item.
- Systems and methods of the present disclosure can provide an improved online user experience on client devices selecting to affirmatively receive context-based third-party content by reducing the amount of third-party content presented on such client devices.
- the data processing system such as a content item selection system, can be configured so that client devices that affirmatively select to receive context-based third-party content are provided with third-party online content on a reduced fraction of visits to publishers' domains (such as websites, social networks, gaming platforms or search engines) by such client devices.
- a client device selecting to receive context-based third-party content can receive less third-party content, but the third-party content that is received by the client device may be more relevant to users of the client devices.
- While reducing third-party content provided for display on client devices selecting to receive context-based third-party content can be an appealing incentive to many users of client devices, such reduction can pose technical and fundamental challenges with regard to operations of an online content delivery system.
- the data processing system in the current disclosure can employ an auction mechanism that allows a reduction in the amount of third-party content provided for display on client devices that have selected to receive context-based third-party content.
- the auction mechanism can achieve such reduction by using reserve prices (also referred to as minimum bid values) for client device-publisher pairs to ensure that for a fraction of the queries associated with each client device, no third-party content items are provided for display on the respective client device. That is, the data processing system can select the reserve prices in a way to ensure that candidate bids from different third-party content providers fail to meet such reserve prices often enough such that third-party content items are provided for display to any client device that have selected to receive context-based third-party content in only a fraction of the queries associated with that client device.
- reserve prices also referred to as minimum bid values
- the data processing system can construct the auction mechanism (or compute the reserve prices) by using an optimization formulation that maximizes a cumulative gain (also referred to as economic welfare) for publishers and third-party content providers subject to a constraint that enforces reduction in the number of third-party content items provided for display to each client device selecting to receive context-based third-party content.
- the gain for publishers can be defined in terms of publishers' revenue.
- the gain for third-party content providers (also referred to as economic efficiency) can be defined in terms of the differences between the bid values made by the third-party content providers and the respective actual paid prices for having respective third-party content displayed on client devices.
- the cumulative gain can be a weighted average of publishers' revenues and economic efficiency for third-party content providers.
- the optimization formulation can also include another constraint to ensure a minimum publisher revenue for each publisher.
- the data processing system instead of enforcing a minimum publisher revenue for each publisher, can be configured to boost revenue for low-revenue publishers using extra money generated by well performing publishers.
- the data processing system can collect bidding data for previous auctions associated with different client device-publisher pairs. Based on the collected data, the data processing system can generate statistical parameters (such as cumulative distribution function values and probability density function values) associated with client device-publisher pairs. In some implementations, the data processing system can classify client devices and publishers into a plurality of device groups and a plurality of publisher groups and can generate the statistical parameters in association with each group pair including a device group and a publisher group. Using the generated statistical parameters, the data processing system can compute the reserve prices (or generally selection criterion thresholds).
- the data processing system can use the generated statistical parameters to construct an optimization formulation (or an optimization problem) that maximizes a gain function (for instance, defined in terms of average publisher revenues and economic efficiency averages for publishers) subject to a constraint to enforce a reduction in the number of third-party content items presented to each client device selecting to receive context-based third-party content.
- the optimization formulation can also be subject to a further constraint enforcing a minimum publisher revenue for each publisher.
- the data processing system can then compute the reserve prices by solving the optimization problem.
- the data processing system can perform the process of collecting data and computing the reserve prices (or selection criterion thresholds) offline and use the computed reserve prices in online auctions. Once the reserve prices are computed, the data processing system can adopt the computed reserve prices as part of the auction mechanism to select third-party content items for presenting on client devices that have selected to receive context-based third-party content. As such, the reduction in the number of third-party content items for presenting on client devices selecting to receive context-based third-party content can be achieved by modifying default reserve prices with the computed reserve prices in the auction mechanism.
- the benefit of reducing the amount of third-party content for presenting to client devices selecting to receive context-based third-party content in conjunction with maximizing economic welfare for publishers and third-party content providers or enforcing minimum publisher revenues for publishers can outweigh (or at least partially compensate for) the cost of having fewer third-party content items provided for display on client devices selecting to receive context-based third-party content. For instance, by maximizing economic welfare for publishers and third-party content providers or enforcing minimum revenues for publishers, the data processing system allows publishers to make up for any lost revenue due to the reduction in the number of third-party content items provided for display on client devices. Also, the data processing system allows third-party content providers to make use of context-based third-party content delivery to achieve a higher impression rate (such as in association with client devices selecting to receive context-based third-party content) while enjoying price discounts compared to respective bid values.
- Context-based third-party content can include third-party content selected (or to be selected) for display on a client device based on information associated with that client device (such as common characteristics information, preferences, online activity data, location or a combination thereof).
- a data processing system can collect data for bid values (or auction scores) in auctions associated with client device-publisher pairs and compute statistical parameters thereof. For client devices selecting to receive context-based third-party content, the data processing system can derive a selection criterion threshold, such as a reserve price or a minimum bid value, for use in selecting third-party content items for each client device-publisher pair based on the respective computed statistical parameter(s).
- the selection criterion thresholds for different client device-publisher pairs can be derived according to a formulation that guarantees reduction in third-party content items provided for display on client devices selecting to receive context-based third-party content and maximizes economic welfare for third-party content providers and publishers.
- the data processing system (or a computer system coupled thereto) can collect the data and derive the selection criteria thresholds offline.
- the data processing system can then employ the selection criterion thresholds in online auctions to select third-party content items for display on client devices that have selected to receive context-based third-party content.
- the reduction in the amount of third-party content provided for display on client devices that have selected to receive context-based third-party content is achieved without significantly affecting the complexity of the online auction operations performed by the data processing system.

For instance, the data processing system 110 can evaluate (using the reserve prices computed in ACT 310 ) whether the inequality in equation (5) is satisfied for each publisher group P j (or for each publisher). Based on such evaluation(s), the data processing system 110 can determine the publishers (or the groups of publishers) for which the constraint described in equation (5) is not satisfied.

While the modifications performed in ACT 330 results in having the modified reserve prices associated with the identified publishers satisfy the second constraint (to enforce minimum publisher revenue), the same modifications may result in making other reserve prices (not associated with the identified publishers) fail to satisfy the first constraint (such as described in equation (4)).
- the method 300 includes re-computing the reserve prices for the client device-publisher pairs not associated with publisher(s) identified at ACT 320 by maximizing the weighted average of economic efficiency and revenue subject to the first constraint (ACT 340 ).
- the data processing system 110 can hold the reserve prices modified in ACT 330 fixed and re-compute the reserve prices for client device-publisher pairs not associated with publishers identified at ACT 320 by maximizing W (in equation (3)) subject to the first constraint described in equation (4).
- the data processing system 110 can re-compute the reserve prices r i,j based on equation (8).
- the data processing system 110 can determine the value of ⁇ i that would result in reserve prices that satisfy the first constraint in equation (4).
- the data processing system 110 (or a processor coupled thereto) can then loop back to ACT 320 to identify a number of publishers, if any, for which the second constraint is not satisfied. If one or more publishers are identified, the data processing system 110 can proceed to ACT 330 to modify reserve prices associated with the identified publishers and then proceed to ACT 340 to re-compute the reserve prices (for publishers not identified at ACT 320 ) to satisfy the first constraint.
- the data processing system 110 can keep looping through ACTs 320 - 340 until the first constraint is satisfied for all client devices and the second constraint is satisfied for all publishers. In such case, the data processing system 110 can use the computed reserve prices in auctions to select third-party content items for presenting to client devices with publishers' content.
- the final computed reserve prices when used by the data processing system 110 in the auctions, would guarantee a reduction in the number of content items presented to each client device that have selected to receive context-based third-party content.
- the data processing system 110 can perform the methods 200 and 300 offline to compute the reserve prices and then use the computed reserve prices in online auctions to select third-party content for display to client devices.

- the data processing system can apply the process described with regard to ACT 320 using the reserve prices computed above according to ACT 310 to identify the publishers, if any, for which the minimum revenue constraint (as described in equation (5)) is not satisfied.
- such publishers can be identified by evaluating the inequality in equation (5) for each publisher using the computed reserve prices.
- the only publisher for which the minimum revenue constraint (as described in equation (5)) is not satisfied is publisher 1 .
- publisher 1 is having third-party content items shown on the respective website (or publisher domain) 6.25% of the time and, as such, publisher 1 cannot achieve the respective minimum revenue based on the computed reserve prices.
- the other publishers can achieve the respective minimum revenues.
- the data processing system 110 can set the reserve prices for the two different client devices so that publisher 1 can achieve the respective minimum.
- the data processing system 110 can hold the modified reserve prices (as discussed above) for publisher 1 fixed and re-compute the reserve prices associated with only the remaining publishers to maximize the economic efficiency subject to the first constraint (as described in equation (4)).
- the data processing system 110 can identify which, among these two publishers, cannot achieve the respective minimum revenue by evaluating the constraint in equation (5) for both publishers. The result shows that the second constraint as described in equation (5) is not satisfied for publisher 2 .

- the data processing system 110 can keep the reserve prices associated with publishers 1 and 2 fixed (not to be changed) and re-computes the reserve prices associated with the remaining publishers (i.e., publisher 3 ) by maximizing the economic efficiency subject to the first constraint in equation (4).
- the reserve prices associated with all client device-publisher pairs satisfy both the first and second constraints as described in equations (4) and (5). Accordingly, the data processing system 110 can employ the obtained reserve prices in online auctions for processing queries associated with the different client device-publisher pairs.
- the data processing system 110 can compute for a plurality of client device-publisher pairs the respective reserve prices that maximize the weighted average of economic efficiency and revenue W subject to a first constraint enforcing reduction in the amount of third-party content presented to each client device that has selected to receive context-based third-party content.

- the data processing system 110 can use the computed reserve prices in auctions for serving queries associated with the client device-publisher pairs.
- the data processing system can use the computed reserve prices as parameters of an auction mechanism. For any query associated with a respective client device-publisher, the data processing system 110 can consider only bids higher than the reserve price associated with that client device-publisher pair. If all bids are below the reserve price for the client device-publisher pair, the data processing system will not provide any third-party content for display in response to the query.
- the data processing system 110 (or a processor coupled thereto) can then make payments (or assign revenue amounts) to publishers, such that the payment (or the assigned revenue amounts) satisfy minimum publisher revenues for respective publishers.
- the data processing system 110 can assign to each publisher a revenue amount equal to the minimum publisher revenue for that publisher. In some implementations, the data processing system 110 can assign a revenue amount for each publisher that is greater than the respective minimum revenue for that publisher.
- the data processing system 110 can use extra income generated by well-performing publishers (e.g., publishers generating more than their minimum revenue) to make payments to poorly-performing publishers (e.g., publishers generating less than their minimum revenue).
- the data processing system 110 can pay (or assign a revenue) to each publisher based on income generated from third-party content items presented for display with content of that publisher. That is, the data processing system 110 may not enforce minimum publisher revenues for publishers and enforce only the constraint to reduce the amount of third-party content provided to client devices selecting to receive context-based third-party content.

- the data processing system 110 can determine the selection criterion threshold offline. Once the selection criterion threshold is determined, the data processing system 110 can use it in auctions to provide third-party content, with content associated with the publisher, to the client device. In an auction associated with the client device and the publisher, the data processing system can receive bids from one or more third-party content providers. Each provider can bid to have a respective third-party content item presented to the client device with content associated with the publisher.
- the data processing system can determine a bidding score for each third-party content item associated with a respective bid (ACT 460 ).

- the data processing system 110 Upon determining that all bidding scores are below the selection criterion threshold value (ACT 465 ), the data processing system does not provide any of the third-party content items for display to the client device (ACT 470 ).
- the data processing system 110 can compare the bidding scores to the selection criterion threshold and eliminate the third-party content items associated with bidding scores below the threshold value from being considered for display on the client device. If all third-party content items are eliminated, the data processing does not provide third-party content for display, with the publisher content, to the client devices. In such case, only the publisher content is displayed on the client device. Slots reserved for third-party content may be shown as blank when displaying the publisher content.
- the data processing system 110 can select a third-party content item with a respective bidding score exceeding or equal to the selection criterion threshold value for display on the client device (ACT 480 ).

Abstract
Description
E=Σ i,jπi,j[n i,j∫r
where ni,j represents the number of third-party content providers competing in an auction involving a client device from device group Ui and a publisher in a publisher group Pj. Since the number of third-party content providers competing in an auction can be dynamically varying from one auction to another, ni,j can represent the average number of third-party content providers competing in an auction involving a client device from device group Ui and a publisher in a publisher group Pj. The average (or cumulative) revenue for publishers can be described as:
The constraint of enforcing a reduction in the number of third-party content items provided for display by client devices selecting to receive context-based third-party content can be formulated as:
Σjπi,j F i,j(r i,j)n
where πi represents the fraction of queries associates with any client device in the device group Ui. The parameter α can be a constant between 0 and 1 representing a fraction of visits to publisher domains, by a client device receiving context-based third-party content, during which no third-party content is provided for display on that client device. The constraint for enforcing a minimum publisher revenue for each publisher in a publisher group Pj can be formulated as:
where Rj represents the minimum publisher revenue to be achieved for each publisher in the publisher group Pj. The weighted average W (or more generally the objective function W) described by equation (3) and the constraints in equations (4) and (5) can be formulated in many other ways. For instance, the objective function Win equation (3) can be defined further in terms of other factors such as a measure of contextual similarity between third-party content items and content associated with publishers or a measure of relevance of third-party content items to users of the publisher domains. Also, equation (4) can be formulated to in a way that the number of third-party content items provided for client devices selecting to receive (or receiving) context-based third-party content is upper-bounded by a constant number. Also, the minimum publisher revenue in equation (5) can be defined as a function of the performance of the publisher domains (for instance, Rj=Rj(y), where y is a measure of the performance of publisher domains for publishers in the publisher group Pj).
where λi and λj represent Lagrangian multipliers. The solution for the optimization problem can be found by equating the derivative of L with respect to the reserve prices ri,j to zero and solving the resulting equation to find the reserve prices ri,j. Equating the derivative of L with respect to the reserve prices ri,j to zero leads to the equality
That is, for a given publisher in the publisher group Pj, the left side in equation (7) above is equal to the value −λj for all client devices regardless of their user group(s). Given the complexity of equation (7), the data processing system 110 (or a processor coupled thereto can solve for the reserve prices ri,j by employing an iterative process.
for i=1 or 2 and j=1, 2 or 3. Also, the fraction of queries associated with each client device is
for i=1 or 2.
Also, minimum revenues for publisher 1, publisher 2, and publisher 3 are set to R1=0.18, R2=0.365 and R3=0.536.
That is, for publisher 1, the value of the left-hand side of equation (9) is equal to a constant for any client device. A solution can be achieved by setting λ1=0.9375 and λ2=0.46875, which leads to r1,1=0.6 for client device 1 and r2,1=0.3 for client device 2.
