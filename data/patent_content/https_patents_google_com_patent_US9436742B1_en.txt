Definitions
- Search engines provide information about accessible documents such as web pages, images, text documents, and/or multimedia content.
- a search engine may identify the documents in response to a user's search query that includes one or more search terms.
- the search engine ranks the documents based on the relevance of the documents to the query and the importance of the documents and provides search results that include aspects of and/or links to the identified documents.
- This specification is directed generally to ranking search result documents, and, more particularly, to ranking search result documents for a query of a user based on one or more attributes of the user that are associated with one or more of the search result documents.
- Some implementations are directed generally to determining, for each of a plurality of documents, multiple user attributes and associated bias measures to associate with the document.
- a bias measure for a user attribute of a document indicates a likelihood of interaction with the document by users having that user attribute.
- a user attribute and associated bias measure for the document may be determined based on a database of indicated interactions with the document by a set of users associated with the user attribute.
- a user attribute and associated bias measure for a document may be determined based on indicated interactions with the document that collectively reflect interactions in response to multiple unique queries.
- Some implementations are directed generally to ranking search result documents for a user based on the user attributes and associated bias measures associated with the search result documents, and based on a user profile of the user. For example, a search result document may be ranked based on matching user attributes of the user's user profile to user attributes of the search result document, and ranking the search result document based at least in part on the bias measures associated with the matched user attributes.
- a computer implemented method includes the steps of: identifying search result documents for a query submitted by a user; identifying one or more user attributes associated with the user; identifying, for a given document of the search result documents, a set of one or more of the user attributes that are each associated with the given document; identifying, for each of the user attributes of the set, a bias measure for the given document, wherein the bias measure for a user attribute of the set is based on a measure of indicated interactions with the given document by a set of users associated with the user attribute; determining an overall bias measure for the given document based on the bias measures for the user attributes of the set; and determining a ranking of the given document for the query based on the overall bias measure.
- the indicated interactions with the given document by the set of users associated with the user attribute include interactions with the given document independent of the query.
- the method may further include: identifying, for a second document of the search result documents, an additional set of one or more of the user attributes that are each associated with the second document; identifying, for each of the user attributes of the additional set, a second document bias measure for the second document; determining a second document overall bias measure for the second document based on the second document bias measures for the user attributes of the additional set; and determining a ranking of the second document based on the second document overall bias measure.
- one or more of the user attributes of the set are not present in the additional set.
- the set and the additional set include one or more same of the user attributes.
- the method further includes identifying a second document navigational measure of the second document for the query, wherein determining the ranking of the given document for the query is further based on the second document navigational measure of the second document. In some of those implementations, the method further includes: identifying a navigational measure of the given document for the query, wherein determining the ranking of the given document for the query is further based on comparison of the navigational measure of the given document and the second document navigational measure of the second document.
- one or more of the user attributes are based on documents indicated as interacted with by the user, the documents including documents in addition to the search result documents for the query.
- the bias measure for a second user attribute of the set is based on a second measure of second indicated interactions with the given document by a second set of users associated with the second user attribute, the second indicated interactions including only interactions with the given document in response to the query.
- the method further includes: identifying a second user attribute; identifying second user attribute indicated interactions with the given document by a third set of users associated with the second user attribute, the second user attribute indicated interactions including indicated interactions with the given document in response to more than one query; determining a second user attribute bias measure for the given document for the second user attribute, the determining the second user attribute bias measure based on comparison of the third user attribute indicated interactions and the additional indicated interactions; and associating the second user attribute bias measure for the second user attribute with the given document.
- the third set of users includes one or more users not present in the set of users.
- determining the bias measure includes comparison of a quantity of the third user attribute indicated interactions and a quantity of the additional indicated interactions. In some of those implementations, determining the bias measure includes comparing the quantity of first user attribute indicated interactions with a larger quantity of indicated interactions by the first set of users, the larger quantity of indicated interactions including interactions with documents in addition to the given document. In some of those implementations, determining the bias measure includes comparing the second quantity of the additional indicated interactions with a second larger quantity of indicated interactions by the second set of users, the second larger quantity of indicated interactions including interactions with the documents in addition to the given document.
- implementations may include a non-transitory computer readable storage medium storing instructions executable by a processor to perform a method such as one or more of the methods described above.
- implementations may include a system including memory and one or more processors operable to execute instructions, stored in the memory, to perform a method such as one or more of the methods described above.

- all documents indicated as interacted with by a user are identified for inclusion in the set of documents identified at step 200 .
- the set is restricted to a subset of documents based on one or more criteria. For example, in some implementations the set may be restricted to documents indicated as interacted with in a certain time period such as within the last 6 months. Also, for example, in some implementations the set may be restricted to the X documents indicated as interacted with the greatest quantity of times by the user. For example, the 200 documents indicated as interacted with the greatest quantity of times may be selected for inclusion in the set. Also, for example, in some implementations the set may be restricted to documents that are indicated as interacted with at least X times by the user.
- the set may be restricted to documents that are associated with a white-list of documents such as the 300,000 documents interacted with the greatest amount by a set of users such as all users. Additional and/or alternative criteria may optionally be utilized to restrict the set.
- the set of indicated interactions 152 A is an example of a set of indicated interactions from the indicated interactions database 152 and are all associated with one user.
- the indicated interactions 152 A include documents D 1 -D 5 and indications of the quantity of interactions with each of the documents (e.g., 50 interactions with document D 1 ). Although five documents are illustrated in the example of FIG. 3 , it is understood that more or fewer indicated interactions with documents may be included for a user.
- the indicated interactions 152 A also include document attributes A 1 -A 4 , described in more detail with respect to step 205 . In some implementations, the document attributes A 1 -A 4 may be omitted from the indicated interactions 152 A.
- an attribute of a document is one or more features of the document that identify the document, that identify content associated with the document, and/or that identify features related to interactions with the document.
- a feature that identifies the document may include one or more identifiers such as a URL of the document (e.g., “www.exampleurl.com/document1”), a domain at which the document is hosted (e.g., “www.exampleurl.com”), and/or other identifier of the document (e.g., a unique alphanumeric identifier that is not a URL).
- a feature related to interactions with the document may include information related to one or more users who interacted with the document, times and/or dates of interaction with the document, applications used to access the document, and/or other features related to interactions with the document but not necessarily determinable directly from the document.
- an identified attribute may be a single attribute, such as a single document identifier or single entity.
- an identified attribute may be a pair or other n-tuple of attributes.
- an identified attribute for a document may be a pair of a topic associated with the document and a site cluster to which the document belongs.
- the indicated interactions database 152 may include, for each of one or more documents, identifiers of one or more attributes for the document.
- the indicated interactions 152 A each include a document attribute (A X ) associated with the document.
- the user attributes engine 140 may determine an entity and/or other attribute that is associated with a document by referencing a database that contains information related to one or more entities or other attributes associated with a document.
- the user attributes engine may determine an identifier of the document and utilize the identifier as an attribute of the document.
- index 125 may contain, for each of a plurality of documents, a mapping between the document and one or more entities related with the document, and the index 125 may be referenced to identify one or more entities associated with the documents.
- the index 125 may include index entries that associate each of one or more documents with a respective one or more entities associated with the document. For example, for each of a plurality of documents, a mapping (e.g., data defining an association) between the document and one or more entities associated with the document may be identified in the index 125 . In some implementations, an index of documents and associated entities may be provided in an index or other database that is separate from the index 125 . In some implementations entities are topics of discourse. In some implementations, entities are persons, places, concepts, and/or things that can be referred to by a text fragment (e.g., a term or phrase) and are distinguishable from one another (e.g., based on context).
- a mapping e.g., data defining an association
- an index of documents and associated entities may be provided in an index or other database that is separate from the index 125 .
- entities are topics of discourse.
- entities are persons, places, concepts, and/or things that can be referred to by a text
- an entity may be referenced by a unique entity identifier that may be used to identify the entity.
- an entity may be referenced with respect to a unique entity identifier.
- the entity may be referenced with respect to one or more alias and/or other property of the entity.
- an association between a document and an entity may be based on an importance of one or more alias of the entity in the document. For example, appearance of an alias of an entity in important fields and/or with great frequency in a document may be indicative of association of the entity to the document. Also, for example, an association between a document and an entity may be based on presence of additional and/or alternative properties of an entity such as date of birth, place of birth, height, weight, population, geographic location(s), type of entity (e.g., person, actor, location, business, university), etc. In some implementations, an association between a document and an entity may be based on presence in the document of one or more other entities related the entity.
- one or more of the attributes identified at step 205 are associated with the user. In some implementations, all of the attributes identified at step 205 are associated with the user. In some other implementations, the attributes identified at step 205 that are associated with the user are restricted to a subset of attributes based on one or more criteria. For example, in some implementations only attributes associated with the greatest number of indicated interactions may be utilized. In some implementations, a weight may optionally be associated with one or more of the attributes that are associated with the user. In some of those implementations, the weight of an attribute may be based at least in part on the quantity of indicated interactions with documents associated with the attribute.
- the weight may be the number of indicated interactions with the documents and/or may be the number of indicated interactions compared to another quantity of indicated interactions—such as all indicated interactions of the user.

Additional and/or alternative criteria may be utilized.
- one or more documents may be associated with a set of user attributes that are unique from the user attributes of one or more other documents. For example, for a first document, a first set of fifty user attributes may represent a meaningful bias for and/or against the first document; whereas for a second document, a second set of fifty user attributes may represent a meaningful bias for and/or against the document.
- the second set may include one or more user attributes that are unique from the first set.
- the steps of FIG. 4 may be repeated for each of a plurality of additional user attributes to determine bias measures for each of the additional user attributes and optionally associate the additional user attributes and bias measures with the document.

- optional weights associated with the user attributes may also be identified.
- user attributes 154 A of FIG. 3 may be user attributes identified for the user.
- a set of one or more of the user attributes are identified that are associated with a given document of the search result documents.
- the document bias module 112 may determine, for a given search result document of the search result documents identified at step 610 , a set of user attributes that are associated with the search result document.
- the document bias module 112 may identify, for the given search result document, a set of user attributes associated with the document from document attributes and bias measures database 156 .
- user attributes of document entry 1561 may be identified.
- the document bias module 112 may identify those user attributes that are associated with the search result document that match the user attributes associated with the user and identified at step 610 . Exact matching and/or soft matching between user attributes associated with the user and user attributes associated with the document may be utilized. As one example, user attributes A 1 and A 2 of document entry 1561 match user attributes A 1 and A 2 of user attributes 154 A.
- a bias measure for the given document is identified for each of the user attributes of the set identified at step 615 .
- the document bias module 112 may identify the bias measures from document attributes and bias measures database 156 .
- user attribute A 1 of document entry 1561 has a bias measure of 0.8 and user attribute A 2 of document entry 1561 has a bias measure of 2.25.
- an overall bias measure for the given document is determined based on the bias measures identified at step 620 .

For example, those bias measures associated with user attributes having a strong weight for a user may be weighted more heavily in an overall bias measure determination than those bias measures associated with user attributes having a weak weight for a user.
- a ranking of the given document is determined based on the overall bias measure determined at step 625 .
- the ranking engine 110 may utilize other ranking signals for the given document in determining an initial ranking for the given document, and document bias module 112 may adjust (promote or demote) the ranking for the document based on the overall bias measure.
- the overall bias measure may be utilized in determining an initial ranking of the given document. Generally, an overall bias measure that indicates a strong likelihood of interaction with the document may promote the ranking of the document, whereas an overall bias measure that indicates a weak likelihood of interaction with the document may demote the ranking of the document.
- one or more additional criteria may optionally be considered in determining whether to promote or demote the ranking of a search result document based on the overall bias measure.
- one or more criteria that take into account query dependent measures for the given document and/or other search result documents, such as navigational measures, may optionally be utilized.
- one or more criteria may take into account whether the given document and/or other search result documents are “fresh” documents recently added to the index 125 .
- the overall bias measure of the given document in determining whether to promote the ranking of the given document based on the overall bias measure, is compared to the overall bias measure of a more prominently ranked document that is more prominently ranked than the given document based on other ranking signals.
- the overall bias measure of a more prominently ranked document may be determined, for example, based on steps 615 , 620 , and 625 . If the overall bias measure of the given document is more indicative of likelihood of interaction than the overall bias measure of the more prominently ranked document, and if one or more other criteria are optionally met, the ranking of the given document may be promoted.
- the one or more other criteria may include that a ratio of the overall bias measure of the given document to the overall bias measure of the more prominently ranked document satisfies a threshold. For example, in some of those implementations the ratio must be greater than 1.2.
- the one or more other criteria may include that a navigational measure of the more prominently ranked document is below a threshold and/or that a comparison of a navigational measure of the given document and the navigational measure of the more prominently ranked document satisfies one or more thresholds.
- a navigational measure for a document is generally indicative of a selection rate of the document for the search query received at step 600 . For example, a first document that is selected 1000 times for a search query may have a higher navigational measure for that search query than a second document that is selected 500 times for that search query.
- the navigational measure of the more prominently ranked document must be below a threshold before the ranking of the given document is promoted.
- comparison of the navigational measure of the given document and the navigational measure of the more prominently ranked document must satisfy one or more thresholds before the ranking of the given document is promoted.
- the one or more thresholds may optionally take into account the overall bias measure of the given document and the overall bias measure of the more prominently ranked document.
- the overall bias measure in determining whether to promote the ranking of the given document based on the overall bias measure, may be adjusted by ignoring or weighting less heavily one or more of the bias measures identified at step 620 , based on comparison of a quantity of selections of the given document (e.g., by all users and/or users having the user attribute(s) associated with the bias measures) and a quantity of selections by users of the more prominently ranked document. Such adjustment of the overall bias measure may minimize likelihood of promotion of the given document over the more prominently ranked document when the more prominently ranked document is a “fresh” document.
- the more prominently ranked document is a document that has recently been created, it may not yet have a prominent overall bias measure and/or navigational measure. Comparison of a quantity of selections of the given document and a quantity of selections by users of the more prominently ranked document may prevent promotion of the given document over the more prominently ranked document in certain situations in which it may not be desirable to promote the given document over the more prominent document.
- the score for the given document may be compared to the score for the more prominently ranked document (based on other ranking signals), and the score for the given document boosted based on the comparison.
- the score for the more prominently ranked document may be divided by the score for the given document to obtain a boost factor, and the score for the given document may boosted by multiplying the score for the given document by the boost factor.
- Other techniques may be utilized to promote and/or demote the given document.
- the overall bias measure of the given document is compared to the overall bias measure of a less prominently ranked document. If the overall bias measure of the given document is less indicative of likelihood of interaction than the overall bias measure of the less prominently ranked document, and if one or more other criteria are optionally met, the ranking of the given document may be demoted.
- the one or more other criteria may include that a ratio of the overall bias measure of the given document to the overall bias measure of the more prominently ranked document satisfies a threshold.
- the ratio must be less than 0.8.
- the one or more other criteria may include that a navigational measure of the less prominently ranked document is above a threshold and/or that a comparison of a navigational measure of the given document and the navigational measure of the less prominently ranked document satisfies one or more thresholds.
- One or more of the steps of FIG. 6 may be repeated for each of a plurality of additional search result documents to determine rankings of those documents based on the overall bias measures of those documents. For example, one or more of the steps of FIG. 6 may be repeated for one or more of the top X search results documents, such as all search result documents besides the highest ranked search result document.

- the search results may be ranked based on the rankings of the corresponding search result documents. For example, search results corresponding to the highest ranked search result document may be presented most prominently.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current geographic location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
