Embodiment
The various report disclosing with the various user interactions of content is offered to content provider (for example, advertiser).Each user interactions can comprise multiple dimensions, and this dimension can comprise the data associated with user interactions.But such dimension can be sparse filling.Can the mutual single dimension of user generate report, and therefore this report can be also sparse filling.The priority list of useful dimension generates comparatively substantial report, and this priority list can provide the details of enough degree in report.
As running through the term that used all the time herein, user interactions comprises any content of user is presented, and user is in response to any positive actions subsequently of taking to this user's rendering content or do not take action (unless otherwise, be referred to as " action ") (for example chosen content after rendering content, or after rendering content chosen content not).Therefore, user interactions not necessarily need to be by this user in selecting content (or any other positive actions).
User interactions is weighed and can be comprised one or more in following: the time interval is weighed (weighing from the user interactions of one or more appointments to the time transforming), path is weighed (quantity of the user interactions occurring conversion), user interactions path (sequence of the user interactions occurring before conversion), auxiliary mutual weigh (the mutual quantity of specific user occurring before conversion) and auxiliary conversion measurement (quantity of the conversion of being assisted by given content).
Fig. 1 is according to the block diagram of the example context of an illustrative embodiment, wherein Advertising Management System managing advertisement service.Example context 100 comprises network 102, for example Local Area Network, wide area network (WAN), internet or above-mentioned combination.Network 102 connects website 104, user's set 106, advertiser 108 and Advertising Management System 110.Example context 100 can comprise thousands of websites 104, user's set 106 and advertiser 108.
Resource 105 is any data that can provide by network 102.Carry out identifying resource 105 by the resource address associated with resource 105, for example URL(uniform resource locator) of this resource address (URL).For instance, resource 105 can comprise webpage, word processing document, Portable Document format (PDF) document, image, video, compile element, interactive content and be fed to (feed) source.Resource 105 can comprise content, for example word, phrase, image and sound, and this content can comprise embedding information (for example metamessage in hyperlink) and/or embed instruction.Embed instruction and can be included in the code that user device (for example, in web browser) is carried out.Can adopt such as
User's set 106 is electronic installations of being controlled by user, and can ask and receive resource 105 by network 102.The example of user's set 106 comprises personal computer, mobile communications device and other devices that can transmit and receive data by network 102.User's set 106 generally includes the user of being convenient to transmit and receive data by network 102 and applies, for example web browser.
User's set 106 can be asked the resource 105 from website 104.Conversely, the data that represent resource 105 can be offered to user's set 106, for being presented by user's set 106.The data that represent resource 105 can comprise the data that are used to specify the part of the resource that wherein can present advertisement or the part (for example, the position of appearing of pop-up window or the position of appearing in the position of webpage) of user's demonstration.These specified portions that resource 105 or user show are called location advertising.
For ease of search, by the addressable ample resources 105 of network 102, environment 100 can comprise search system 112, and it carrys out recognition resource 105 by the resource 105 capturing and index provides on website 104.Can be based on carrying out the data of index about resource 105 with the resource 105 of data correlation.Alternatively, the index copy of resource 105 and (optionally) cached copy are stored in search index (not shown).
User's set 106 can be submitted search inquiry to search system 112 by network 102.As response, search system 112 access search index, to identify the resource relevant to search inquiry 105.In an illustrative embodiment, search inquiry comprises one or more keywords.Search system 112 is identified in response to the resource 105 of inquiry, is provided the information about this resource 105 with the form of Search Results, and returns to this Search Results with search results pages towards user's set 106.Search Results can comprise the data that generated by search system 112, and its identification response is in the resource 105 of particular search query, and Search Results can be included in the link of resource 105.Presenting of the text fragments that the example of Search Results can comprise web page title, extract from webpage 104 or the part of image, resource 105, and the URL of webpage 104.Result of page searching can also be included in one or more location advertisings that wherein can present advertisement.
Result of page searching can be arranged to HTTP(HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) with the web browser for user's set 106 from search system 112) send together with the request of cookie.For example, cookie can represent particular user device 106 and particular webpage browser.For example, search system 112 comprises server, and this server by sending the inquiry of result of page searching answer in http response.This http response comprises that making browser is that server is posted the website that carries or the instruction (for example, cookie instruction being set) for the territory storage cookie of server.If browser is supported cookie and enabled cookie, will comprise this cookie to each page request subsequently of the server in the territory of this same server or this server.Cookie can store various kinds of data, comprises unique or part unique identifier.It doesn't matter can to conceal this unique or part unique identifier and this unique or part unique identifier and user's name.Because HTTP is stateless protocol, for example, so use cookie to allow external service (search system 112 or other system) to follow the tracks of user's specific action and state in multiple sessions.For example, user can, by the middle forbidding of arranging of browser cookie, select to exit tracking user action.
In the time of user's set 106 request resource 105 or Search Results, or in the time that resource 105 or Search Results are offered to user's set 106, Advertising Management System 110 receives the request to advertisement, and wherein this advertisement will be provided together with resource 105 or Search Results.The feature of the resource 105 of request or the location advertising of result of page searching definition can be included as to the request of advertisement, and Advertising Management System 110 can be provided for.For example, can provide to Advertising Management System 110: for example, to quote (URL) of resource 105, wherein defined location advertising for this resource 105; The size of location advertising; And/or be used in the medium type presenting in this location advertising.Similarly, can also provide to Advertising Management System 110 search inquiry of the keyword associated with the resource 105 of asking one or more words of relevance (with) (" resource keyword ") or request Search Results, to help the advertisement that identification is relevant to resource 105 or search inquiry.
Based in the data that the request of advertisement is comprised, Advertising Management System 110 can be selected to provide in response to this request, qualified advertisement (" qualified advertisement ").For example, qualified advertisement can comprise having the advertisement of the feature matching to the feature of location advertising and be identified as and the resource keyword of specifying or the relevant advertisement of search inquiry.In certain embodiments, elect the advertisement with the target keyword matching with the part of resource keyword, search inquiry or search inquiry as eligible advertisement by Advertising Management System 110.
Similarly, in the time that user selects advertisement that (click) present, the data that represent the selection to advertisement can be stored in journal file 116, cookie or history data repository 119.In certain embodiments, in response to by advertisement link to the request of webpage store data.For example, user can initiate to present the request of the webpage being provided by (or being) advertiser to the selection of advertisement.This request can comprise the data of mark about the specific cookie of user's set, and these data can be stored in advertisement data store.
User interactive data can be associated with unique identifier, and this unique identifier represents to carry out the corresponding user's set of user interactions.For example, in certain embodiments, user interactive data can be associated with one or more cookie.Each cookie can comprise the content of specifying initialization time, and this initialization time indication arranges at first the time of this cookie in particular user device 106.
As described above, the report that offers certain content supplier can be described for weigh performance measurement that occurred, user and content exchange before transforming.In the time that user carries out required movement, transform, and conversion pathway comprises the one group of user interactions that transforms and occurred before carrying out conversion by user.Can regard any one or more user interactions as conversion.Forming the factor transforming may be different because of thing, and can in all sorts of ways to determine to be that what formation transforms.For example, when user clicks advertisement, forwards webpage or website to, then complete while buying leaving before this webpage or website at that, can transform.Again for example, when user is in the time that specific website spends the time of measuring more than preset time, can transform.Can be used for determining the time quantum at specific website from the data of multiple user interactions.
Can specify the action that forms conversion by each advertiser.For example, each advertiser can select one or more measurement/observable user action as conversion, for example download white paper, at least navigate to the given depth of website, at least check the webpage of some, at least on website or webpage, spend predetermined time amount, or register on website.Also can use and form other actions that transform.
Follow the tracks of conversion (and mutual with other of advertiser's website), advertiser can comprise embedding instruction in this advertiser's webpage, the wherein user interactions of this embedding instruction monitoring and advertiser's website (for example page is selected, content item selects and other are mutual), and can detect and form the user interactions (or a series of user interactions) transforming.In certain embodiments, when user is from webpage referenced (or other resources) accessed web page, or when another resource, can identify about this mutual webpage referenced (or other resources), for example, can be by carrying out the code snippet that be quoted by just accessed webpage and/or based on identifying for the URL that accesses this webpage.
For example, user can visit by being chosen in the link presenting on webpage advertiser's website, and for example, selection is as the link of the part of the popularization activity of advertiser's affiliate (affiliate).This link can be associated with the URL of the data (being text) that comprise unique identification resource, and wherein user navigates from this resource.For example, link http://www.example.com/homepage/%aff iliate_identifier%promotion_1 shows user to navigate to example.com webpage from the webpage of the affiliate associated with the affiliate identifier of specifying this URL, and based on being chosen in linking of comprising in the popularization activity associated with promotion_1, user is directed to example.com webpage.Can deposit database in about this user interactive data of (selecting link) alternately, and as mentioned below, facilitate and show report with this user interactive data.
When detect conversion for advertiser, can represent that the conversion data transforming is transferred to the data processing equipment (" analytical equipment ") that receives this conversion data, and then this conversion data is stored in data-carrier store.Can store explicitly this conversion data with one or more cookie of the user's set for carrying out user interactions, make the user interactive data associated with cookie can with transform associatedly, and can be used for generating about the performance of this conversion and report.
Conventionally, when the advertisement that uses target keyword to be decided to be target is, while transforming the front last advertisement of clicking, to think that this conversion is owing to this target keyword.For example, advertiser X can be associated keyword " tennis ", " footwear " and " brand X " with advertisement.In this example, suppose that user submits the first search inquiry to " tennis " to, present the result of page searching of the advertisement that comprises advertiser X to this user, and this user selects this advertisement, but this user does not take to form the action transforming.Further this user of hypothesis submits the second search inquiry to " brand X " subsequently to, presents the advertisement of advertiser X to this user, and user selects the advertisement of advertiser X, and user takes to form the action (for example, user buys brand X tennis shoes) transforming.In this example, by this conversion, owing to keyword " brand X ", this is the advertisement presenting because last advertisement of selecting before transforming (" advertisement of finally selecting ") is in response to coupling " brand X ".
Provide to causing being presented on before conversion the keyword of the last advertisement of selecting that to transform score (" finally selecting score (credit) ") be that the one of advertisement performance is effectively weighed, but be only that this measurement can not be offered help and analyze the data of transformation period to advertiser, this transformation period is included in advertisement contact and/or the selection of user to advertisement before of last selection.For example, independent last selection score weighs that do not describe may be by having increased the keyword of brand or product popularity before selecting this last advertisement of selecting to presenting of the advertisement of presenting to user and/or selected by user.But these advertisements may be to taking the user who forms the action transforming to have major contribution subsequently.
In the above example, even if the advertisement presenting in response to the search inquiry of matching keywords " tennis " may for example, have contribution to the user who takes the action (buying brand X tennis shoes) that forms conversion, but does not provide about any score transforming to keyword " tennis ".For example, in the time of advertisement that user selects to present in response to matching keywords " tennis ", user may check the brand X tennis shoes that can obtain from advertiser X.Contact based on user to brand X tennis shoes, user may submit search inquiry " brand X " subsequently to, to find the tennis shoes from brand X.Similarly, the selection regardless of user to advertisement, user also for example, contributes the user who takes subsequently the action (buying the product from advertiser X) that forms conversion to some extent to the contact that uses keyword " tennis " to be decided to be the advertisement of target.Analyze the user who selects to occur before the last advertisement of selecting and advertiser's advertisement (or other guide) alternately, can improve advertiser and understand the ability of this advertiser's transformation period.
Transformation period is when presenting advertisement to user, and during user takes to finish while forming the action transforming.Can weigh and/or retrain the transformation period by time or action, and this transformation period can cross over multiple user conversations.User conversation is the set condensing together for the user interactions analyzed.Each user conversation comprises data that expression is carried out by specific user and the user interactions of (being designated duration) in session window.For example, session window can be the time period (for example 1 hour, 1 day or 1 month) of specifying, or can delimit this session window with required movement.For example, user search session user search queries that occur in can being included in during 1 hour and/or that for example, occur before in conversation end event (, closing search browser) and action subsequently.
Analyze the transformation period can improve advertiser understand within the transformation period its client how with the mutual ability of advertisement.For example, if advertiser determines that contacting for the first time advertisement from user is 20 days to the mean time area of a room transforming, advertiser can infer that user is transforming (taking to form the action transforming) front time quantum spending for studying alternate source by these data.Similarly, if advertiser determines the user that much transforms and does like this after using particular keywords to be decided to be the presenting of advertisement of target, advertiser may wish to increase the amount of funds that it spends in the advertisement that uses this keyword to distribute, and/or improves the quality that uses this particular keywords to be decided to be the advertisement of target.
Help the user interactions measurement of analyzing the transformation period can be called conversion pathway performance measurement.Conversion pathway is transformed front by specific user and comprising one group of user interactions of this specific user of this conversion.As be described in more detail below, user interactions path before conversion pathway performance is weighed and describe the duration of transformation period, the amount of user interaction occurring within the duration of transformation period, transforms, the mutual quantity of specific user occurring before transforming, and other measurements to the user interactions occurring within the duration of transformation period.
Can provide config option to reduce the deviation in performance report.There is no config option, some performance report may have deviation, for example, be partial to short conversion pathway.For example, if comprise the number percent in the Partial Conversion path higher than threshold percentage by the basic data of giving a report, performance report may be partial to short conversion pathway.Partial Conversion path be wherein about some user interactive datas of user but not all user interactive data all with transform associated conversion pathway.For example, if generate report with report period of typical transformation period length of the advertiser who is less than request report, can in this report, add Partial Conversion path.
Report period is determined the maximum length (to represent over sky) of transformation period of reporting, and this is because the excessive data outside operation report phase not generates this report.Performance report can be based on report period (looking back window), makes the user interactions before the report period not to be regarded as the part of transformation period in the time generating report.Such report period is called " review window ".For example, in the time generating report according to the review window of 30 days, be illustrated in the available subscribers interaction data of the user action occurring between July 1 in given time and July 31, will be available to the conversion occurring this year July 31.
For example, in the time using acquiescence to look back window (30 days), if being greater than this acquiescence, the typical transformation period length of the product associated with report looks back window, show public lecture and be partial to short conversion pathway.For example, in example above, the typical transformation period of " brand X " tennis shoes (for example 30 days) is with for example, compare compared with the transformation period of your make (, new car) may be relatively short.New car can have the longer transformation period (for example, 90 days).
Different advertisers or advertiser's different product can have different associated transformation period length.For example, sell at a low price (being for example less than 100 dollars) advertiser of product and can specify the review window of 30 days, and the advertiser who sells more expensive product (for example at least 1000 dollars) can specify the review window of 90 days.
In some embodiments, advertiser 108 can in the time of request performance report, for example, specify the review window that will use by input number of days or for example, by select to look back window from specific review window list (30 days, 60 days, 90 days).Allow advertiser to configure the review window of their performance report, make advertiser can select the review window corresponding with their transformation period of product.Allow to look back window configuration and also make advertiser to test with different review windows, its possibility of result causes finding to improve the method for conversion rate.
Other factors can work to report section conversion pathway.For example, as described above, use the basic user interactive data of giving a report to be associated with the unique identifier that represents user's set, wherein carry out user interactions with this user's set.As described above, unique identifier can be stored as to cookie.Can delete cookie from user's set, for example, can be by the browser of the user of deletion cookie, deletion cookie (for example,, in the time exiting browser, set based on browser parameters), or some other softwares (for example Rogue Anti-Spyware) of deletion cookie are deleted cookie.
If deleted cookie from user's set, for example, when user's accessed web page (search system 112), new cookie can be set on user's set.This new cookie can be used for storing new part unique identifier, and the user interactive data subsequently therefore occurring on this user's set can be associated from different identifiers.Therefore,, owing to thinking that each user identifier represents different users, so compare with the user interactive data of associated new cookie, the user interactive data associated from deleted cookie is identified as with different users and is associated.
For example, in example above, suppose that user deletes cookie carrying out after to first search inquiry of " tennis ", and in the deleted rear generation of cookie the second search inquiry to " brand X ".In this example, the performance of calculating based on the user interactive data about user is weighed may there is deviation.For example, because the advertisement selection the first search inquiry not being caused is regarded the part of the transformation period that the advertisement selection that causes with the second search inquiry is identical as, so weighing, path may be calculated as one, rather than two, this is because these two user interactions seem not to be to be carried out by identical user.
Check the report that reduces the deviation being caused by Partial Conversion path, advertiser can be this report and specifies review window.As described above, looking back window appointment is the user interactive data associated with unique identifier for the user interactive data that generates report, wherein, this unique identifier has designated duration (for example 30 days, 60 days, 90 days) before conversion initialization time before.Therefore, be not included for the conversion that wherein user interactive data is associated with the unique identifier with the initialization time after this designated duration the basis that is used as this report.The unique identifier with nearest initialization time is indicated on the user's set that may represent at this unique identifier recently and has been reinitialized this unique identifier.Therefore, the user interactive data associated with relatively new unique identifier can only represent part conversion pathway.Or, be comprised in this report with the conversion that the unique identifier with the initialization time after this designated duration is associated for user interactive data wherein.For reducing deviation, before adding report, from conversion pathway, remove any user interactions comprising in conversion pathway, occur after designated duration.
Fig. 2 is the process flow diagram for the method for integrated user interactions daily record data according to an illustrative embodiment.Method 200 is to upgrade conversion pathway and determine the method transforming based on user's conversion pathway of upgrading.
Can be on Advertising Management System 110, performance point desorption device 120 or another calculation element implementation method 200.In one embodiment, coding method 200 on computer-readable medium, this computer-readable medium comprises the instruction that makes the operation of this calculation element manner of execution 200 in the time being carried out by calculation element.
As described above, journal file 116 can comprise user interactive data.Journal file 116 can combine with the user interactive data of other daily records from other servers before processing, comprises those servers of realizing search system 112.Process from the calculation element of implementation method 200 determine new daily record can be used for process (210).For example, can send the notice of indicating new daily record to be ready for processing to calculation element, or the existence of new daily record can indicate this new daily record to be ready for processing.
Next, retrieve new daily record (220).Can retrieving novel daily record on network 102.User action based on being indicated by new daily record upgrades each user's state history.New daily record can comprise the information relevant to multiple users' user interactions.History data repository 119 comprises the user interactive data from previously processed journal file.Owing to can according to user identifier, user interactive data being divided into groups and by the time, it be sorted, so the user interactive data comprising in history data repository 119 can have state.Fig. 3 is the block diagram that is described in the user interactive data upgrading in the duration of user interactions daily record data integrated approach 200 according to an illustrative embodiment.Fig. 3 shows four user identifier examples, but history data repository 119 can comprise the data associated with thousands of or millions of different user identifiers with journal file 116.In one embodiment, previously stored user interactive data 310 is stored in history data repository 119.As shown in the figure, previously also in history data repository 119, do not stored the user interactive data associated with user identifier 3.
New daily record can comprise the user interactive data about one or more user identifiers.Can divide into groups to user interactive data according to user identifier and then by time sort (230).Row 320 illustrate the user interactive data that divides into groups and sort.As shown in the figure, user identifier 2 does not comprise any new user interactive data, and user identifier 1,3 and 4 has upgraded user interactive data.For example, new journal file comprises the user interactive data associated with being associated with the user interactions a13 of user identifier 1 and a14.Then, divided into groups can merge mutually (240) with the user interactive data of storage in history data repository 119 with the user interactive data of sequence.If preexist user identifier in history data repository 119, adds new user interactive data to previous user interactive data.Otherwise, add new user interactive data and new user identifier.
