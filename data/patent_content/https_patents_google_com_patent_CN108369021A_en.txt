In the presence of and movement detection systems
Certain embodiments described herein detects the presence close to the user of intelligent dwelling device and correspondingly changes intelligence
The operation of residential device.For example, intelligent thermostat can include advanced user interfaces, it includes can scroll through menus, graphical schedule,
Set point temperatures interface, animation etc..The usual power consumption of these higher level operations that user interface executes is very high, in frequent operation
Pressure can be brought to the power-supply management system of intelligent thermostat.Therefore, intelligent thermostat can utilize proximity sensor and other
In the presence of detection input come determine user when close to thermostat to be intended to and user interface interaction.This makes intelligent thermostat advisably
Retain its resource, only if necessary just activated user interface to obtain positive user experience.
Above-mentioned intelligent thermostat includes two distinct types of proximity sensor.First proximity sensor has from thermostat
The far-field range to extend outwardly between 15 feet to 30 feet.In other embodiments, used hardware sensor is depended on
Concrete type, the first proximity sensor may be embodied in the far-field range extended between 0 foot to 50 feet.Second close biography
Sensor has 5 feet to 10 feet of the near field range of can only extending outwardly from thermostat.Far field proximity sensor can be used for greatly
The presence of the user in the enclosure space such as house is detected on body.When detecting the presence of at home, thermostat can continue
It operates in the normal mode, as dispatched programmed control HVAC system according to set point.But it if is not detected at home
In the presence of thermostat may enter " leaving automatically " pattern, in this mode set point temperatures meeting increase/decrease, to be in
In nobody when it is energy saving.Far field proximity sensor is very useful to this operation, because it can usually be detected in temperature controller visual field
User.But other than being only used for " leaving automatically " feature, far field proximity sensor and proximity sensor usually can be with
There is other application in intelligent thermostat.
Second proximity sensor has near field range, can also be used for detection user and exists, and can be additionally used in detection and connect
The user of nearly thermostat with thermostat to interact.Pleasant user experience can be provided by opening user interface, and be allowed
User can check Current Temperatures, set point temperatures and current HVAC functions without touching user interface.It is connect by detecting user
Closely, thermostat can balance delicate power management tradeoff, and user interface is deactivated when user is not intended to interact with thermostat, and
The activated user interface when user is close.
In some embodiments, detect that user is close when user first enters in the range of the proximity sensor of far field.
If user then moves in the range of the proximity sensor of near field, user interface will be activated.It is close for detecting user
This method be fully described in the 8th, 560, No. 128 commonly assigned United States Patent (USP), the United States Patent (USP) is to quote
Mode is incorporated herein.
Embodiment described herein in, more advanced second proximity sensor is presented.Specifically, multichannel IR thermoelectricity
The user that heap is applied not only in detection near field range exists, and is additionally operable to the movement of characterization user.For example, with left channel, center
The proximity sensor in channel and right channel can distinguish user and from left to right pass by the movement of thermostat, thermostat of passing by from right to left
Movement and user interacted from right side close to temperature controller with thermostat.From the various of near field proximity sensor
The response in channel can be used for identifying the Move Mode of these types.The pattern that these are sensed can just be approached perseverance with user
The known mode of warm device is compared to interact with thermostat.Use these information, thermostat system (such as user interface)
It can be more advisably activated according to the movement of user.
Once user have been approached thermostat with user interface interaction, near field proximity sensor can execute additional functionality.
User can use gesture, such as from left to right or up and down brandish their hand, so as in the case where not contacting thermostat to
User interface provides order.For example, from left to right waving that custom menu can be activated or being rolled around between menu option.Circle
The hand movement (it can sequentially activate left channel, lower channel, right channel, upper channel etc.) of shape movement can serve to indicate that
Similar to the becket rotation of the perimeter around thermostat.Near field proximity sensor is described in more detail below to move based on user
Trend thermostat provides the other command types and purposes of information.
Figure 12 shows near field proximity sensor range 1202 and far field proximity sensor range in accordance with some embodiments
1210.User 1212 is except far field proximity sensor range 1210.Therefore, the far field on intelligent dwelling device 1204 is close passes
Sensor will not generate response, and intelligent dwelling device 1204 " will not see " user 1212.Because user 1212 is remote
Except field proximity sensor range 1210, so intelligent dwelling device 1204 may finally be entered leaves pattern automatically, unless with
Family 1212 moves closer to intelligent dwelling device 1204.
User 1208 is in far field proximity sensor range 1210, but except near field proximity sensor range 1202.
In this stage, intelligent dwelling device 1204 " will see " user 1208, and it is occupied to will be appreciated by enclosure space.This should prevent intelligence
Residential device 1204 enters leaves pattern automatically.Although user 1208 it is still remote enough apart from intelligent dwelling device 1204 so that
User interface will not be activated, but intelligent dwelling device 1204 can start watch near field proximity sensor different channels with
Generate the response higher than predetermined threshold.In this sense, the response from far field proximity sensor can be such that intelligent dwelling fills
Setting 1204 processing system can start to working from the response of near field proximity sensor.In some embodiments, this can
For use as the buffer zone of wrong report is prevented, advanced before the action for taking such as activated user interface etc by requiring user
Pass through by far field proximity sensor range 1210 and then near field proximity sensor range 1202.
On the contrary, user 1206 comes near field proximity sensor range 1202.In some embodiments, it is more than that instruction is used
Family may be enough to take the action such as activated user interface already close to the single threshold value of intelligent dwelling device 1204.Other
In embodiment, the mode of type of sports or user 1206 close to intelligent dwelling device 1204 can be carried out with predetermined mobile signature
Compare with determine user 1206 be close to intelligent dwelling device 1204 so as to user interface interaction or user 1206 only
Only it is intelligent dwelling device 1204 of passing by.When some users pass by intelligent dwelling device 1204 but be not intended and intelligent dwelling fill
User may be bothered by setting 1204 user interfaces when interacting and being activated.Unnecessary activation can be considered as waste energy or
Divert one's attention.Be compared with predetermined mobile signature by signing current kinetic, can be made by intelligent dwelling device 1204 about
The determination of the intention of user 1206.
As it is used herein, term " movement signature " can be used for describing and the different channels by near field proximity sensor
The sequence of the corresponding directionality instruction of response of generation.For example, when user's movement passes through the respective response of near field proximity sensor
Qu Shi, movement signature can be simple as " left side, center, the right side ".In four-way proximity sensor, "center" response can correspond to
In the combination of the response on lower channel, the response on upper channel and/or the response on upper and lower channel.In another example,
Movement signature can include when user enters and/or leave the instruction in the region by the channel covering of sensor.For example, when into
When entering the region of left channel covering, movement signature can include " to reach：The instruction on a left side ".When user leaves the area of left channel covering
When domain, movement signature can include " to leave：The instruction on a left side ".The arrival for one or more areas/leave instruction can be combined
To form entire movement signature.Movement signatures examples are described in more detail below.
Figure 13 shows the figure of the movement of the plane in accordance with some embodiments perpendicular to intelligent dwelling device 1320.Range
The range of 1318 instruction far field proximity sensors.The range of near field proximity sensor can start at range 1310, and open
Begin to generate response between range 1310 and range 1316.At range 1316, towards the use of the movement of intelligent dwelling device 1320
It is expected to generate response in family.Go beyond the scope 1310, the user moved towards intelligent dwelling device 1320 is expected not will produce response.
Between range 1310 and range 1316, the user moved towards intelligent dwelling device 1320 will start to generate response.When response foot
When being considered as the instruction of movement, range 1314 indicates threshold value.
In one example, the direction in straight line path 1306 of user 1302 is mounted with intelligent dwelling device 1320 thereon
Wall moves, but not directly faces the movement of intelligent dwelling device 1320.When user 1302 oversteps the limits 1314 at position 1318
Threshold value when, the near field proximity sensor of intelligent dwelling device 1320 should generate response on one or more channels.Depend on
Arrangement mode in channel, user 1302 should generate response on left channel, and can also generate sound on channel over/under
It answers.
In another example, it is simultaneously vertical to be directly toward intelligent dwelling device 1302 in straight line path 1308 by user 1304
In the planar movement of intelligent dwelling device 1302.When user 1304 overstep the limits at position 1,312 1314 when, near field close to pass
One or more channels of sensor should generate response.In this case, the up/down channel of near field proximity sensor is likely to
Generate strong response.Left channel and/or right channel may also generate weaker response.
Such as above-described sample path 1306 and 1308 may be used as training data with the threshold value of the range of definition 1314
It is horizontal.Positive response of the optimal threshold usually by generation for path 1308, and path 1306 should be just in threshold skirt.
Figure 14 shows the sample in accordance with some embodiments that can be detected using threshold value 1414 by intelligent dwelling device 1420
This horizontal route.Here it is possible to select threshold value so that the path 1404 intersected just with the range of near field proximity sensor 1416
Positive response will be generated, and positive response will not be generated with the path 1402 that range 1410 just intersects.Figure 14 also illustrate how for
Each area's setting arrives and departs from threshold value.For center (up/down) channel, 1404 should generate arrival at position 1420 rings
It answers, and is generated at position 1418 and leave response.In a particular embodiment, such as these test path generates such as following table
Listed arrival in 1/leave threshold value.
Channel | Value |
Up/down reaches threshold value | 127 |
Left/right reaches threshold value | 129 |
Up/down leaves threshold value | -55 |
Left/right leaves threshold value | -89 |
Table 1- threshold values
Value in table 1 corresponds to Asahi Chemical IndustryAK9750 four-way IR sensor ICs use four
A quantum IR sensors.AK9750 also uses the output of 16 output offer analog-digital converters.In some embodiments, different thresholds
Value can be used for upper channel rather than lower channel, rather than use same threshold as shown in table 1.
Figure 15 shows the example of the diagonal path 1502 in accordance with some embodiments towards intelligent dwelling device 1520.It is right
Angle path 1502 may generate response in right channel and center (up/down) channel, and threshold value is crossed at position 1520.
Including in some embodiments of multichannel proximity sensor, channel capacity can be ignored, and can be by simply will be different
The response in channel is added or is averaging together and multichannel proximity sensor is used as single channel proximity sensor.In showing for Figure 15
In example, left channel can be added together with the response in central passage to generate the threshold for indicating user near field proximity sensor
The single complex response being worth in range.
Figure 16 shows the four-way viewing areas of near field proximity sensor 1600 in accordance with some embodiments.AK9750 packets
Sensor array containing IR 1610 is arranged at the top of IC package with left and right, upper and lower orientation.It is passed as described above, near field is close
Sensor 1600 is installed to the sensor flexible unit of intelligent thermostat, and is used for far field PIR proximity sensors positioned at providing
The Multifunctional lens rear of Fresnel lens part and thin lens near field proximity sensor 1600.IR sensor arrays
1610 are located on the front of IC package and in encapsulation towards central orientation.For example, sensor downwards is located at IR sensings
The top of device array 1610.Sensor downwards is oriented as slightly at an angle so that it is towards the bottom of IC package.Class
As, it is located at the right side of IR sensor arrays 1610 towards left sensor, and be oriented as slightly at an angle so that its court
To the left side of IC package.IR sensor arrangements on IR sensor arrays 1610 generate four overlappings visual fields 1602,1604,
1606、1608.As shown in Figure 16, the response from right channel will be triggered first, from the close user in right side then from upper logical
Road and lower channel are generated while being responded.
In some embodiments, detection user be below the device or above device close to intelligent dwelling device not
It is particularly useful.On the contrary, the response combination of upper channel and lower channel can be got up to generate central passage.When combination upper channel and
When lower channel, multiplier can be used to give a discount lower channel, to ignore the response from children and pet.Children anticipate close to thermostat
Figure and thermostat interaction are unlikely, and activated user interface is only waste of energy when pet is close.In a reality
Apply in example, the response generated on lower channel can be multiplied by 0.3, later again with the response combination that is generated from upper channel.Other realities
Applying example can be using the multiplier in 0.1 to 0.7 range.
It is close Figure 17 shows being designed to filter before microprocessor (for example, primary processor) processing by processing system
The characteristic response of the digital filter of the output response of field proximity sensor.From each IR channel receptions of near field proximity sensor
Sample in there are DC components.DC compensation reflects the whole IR brightness of visual field rather than the movement in visual field.Receive the height of sample
Frequency component is mainly heated and/or therefore electrical noise should use reception of the bandpass filter to the sample from each channel
Time series is filtered.It is, for example, possible to use filtering equation below.
Y [n]=x [n]-x [n-2]+c1y[n-1]-c2y[n-2] (1)
In equation (1), x [n] indicates that the Src Chan sample in time n, y [n] indicate the channel sample in time n
Filtered version.It can be based on used certain types of near field proximity sensor come selectivity constant value.For example, above-mentioned
In the case of AK9750, following constant value can be used.
c1=1.25236 and c2=0.2637729 (2)
The frequency response 1700 of this bandpass filter from equation (1) and equation (2) is shown in Figure 17.It should be noted that band
Logical gain is more than one (0dB).In some cases, band-pass gain is confirmed as the single order with 1/200 normalization cutoff frequency
The tandem compound of butterworth high pass filter and the single order Butterworth LPF for normalizing cutoff frequency with 1/3.
Scale factor x [n]-x [n-2] has been removed to save a multiplication in being filtered, because the factor can easily simultaneously thus
Enter in threshold value itself.
Figure 18 shows the flow chart in accordance with some embodiments for detecting method of the user close to intelligent dwelling device
1800.The method can include near field proximity sensor detection motion feature (1802).In the simplest embodiment, it moves
Signature can be only the predetermined threshold distance that intelligent dwelling device is had moved to about user near field proximity sensor
Interior instruction.For example, four-way near field proximity sensor can combine the response from all channels, to generate about user
Whether the single instruction in the range of proximity sensor of near field.In other embodiments, near field proximity sensor can be passed through
Detect more complicated movement signature.As set forth above, it is possible to which the threshold value of each sensor is arranged to determine it is each when user reaches
The visual field in channel or the visual field for leaving each channel.It, can be by the filtering from these channels for left channel and right channel
Device responds compared with threshold value progress simply.
For up/down channel, lower channel that can be by the filter response in the two channels and upper channel and after giving a discount it is total
Be compared.
yUp[n]+0.3yDown[n]≥UD_ARR_THRESH (4)
Equation (3) and (4) show how to determine whether user arrives using the filter response from each channel
Up to the visual field in the channel.Determine user whether leave the channel visual field use with different threshold values identical equation (for example,
LR_DEP_THRESH and UD_DEP_THRESH).Therefore, whether some movement signatures can be reached or be left by user and is specific logical
The single instruction of the visual field in road forms.
In some embodiments, it may be determined that more complicated movement signature.These more complicated movement signatures can be used for
Determine the anticipatory behavior of user.For example, complicated movement signature can determine user whether be intended to close to intelligent dwelling device with
Whether it is intended to pass by intelligent dwelling device in corridor without interacting with user interface interaction or user.Complicated fortune
The group that dynamic signature can be indicated by above-mentioned each channel is combined into.For example, if seeing that user reaches left channel, then reach
Right channel, is then departed from left channel, then can be inferred that user has from left to right passed through the front of device.Intelligent dwelling device
Sleep state can be kept, rather than opens user interface.Following table 2 lists can indicate that the difference of structure is complicated from channel
Move the sample of signature.
Table 2-movement signature
In some embodiments, it is also possible to which signing to movement adds timing element.Each movement signature can include by
Time between each channel instruction that reason system receives.For example, for above-mentioned sequence, movement signature can indicate as follows：
ARR_L,[1.1sec],ARR_R,[0.6sec],DEP_L.Addition timing information is for determining when user is parked in intelligent dwelling
The front of device is highly useful.For example, if user reaches from left side, then reached from right side, and have passed through certain threshold
Value time quantum (for example, 0.5 second) leaves instruction without receiving, then may infer that user already close to intelligent dwelling device,
And it is interacted with intelligent dwelling device before being parked in intelligent dwelling device.
It can respond by filtering and near field proximity sensor channel reception and be stored in and can sign with known movement
Movement signature is gradually built up in the movement signature vector being compared.If by scheduled time interval without any shifting
It is dynamic, or see on the channel of number of thresholds and leaving, then it can refresh the vector of storage.
The method can also include to determine whether received movement signature matches any of movement signature
(1804).Intelligent dwelling device can be received known movement signature by various ways.First, intelligent dwelling device can
To receive the library of known movement signature from central management server.Certain movement signatures (comprising with some signatures in upper table 2)
It is likely to be suited for that most of environment of intelligent dwelling device can be installed.It is filled for example, instruction user from left to right passes through intelligent dwelling
The movement signature for setting front is the common signature that possible occur in many installation sites.Central management server can be stored and is based on
The database of the movement signature of the experiment preprogramming carried out in test environment.Alternatively or in addition, central management server
The movement signature of record can be received from any intelligent dwelling device for being connected to its network.Since intelligent dwelling device is distributed in
In the family of entire coverage, therefore it can retrieve and analyze a large amount of movement signature.Central management server can be to receiving
To movement sign into column hisgram or other statistical analyses, and select those the frequency of occurrences be most in widest familial distribution of cases
High motion feature.These movement signatures can be assumed as many different installation environments and many different user types
It is common.Selected movement signature can then download to each intelligent dwelling device for being connected to network and be used as being compared
Compared at least one initial baseline.
The history that intelligent dwelling device is also based in its direct environment interacts to receive known movement signature.Such as with
Upper step (1802) is described, whenever generating response from one or more channels of multichannel near field proximity sensor, intelligently lives
Residence device will record one group of response to generate movement signature.After user leaves region, movement signature can be stored in by spy
In the historical data base for determining the movement signature that intelligent dwelling device is observed.As the case where central management server, intelligence
Residential device can also be for statistical analysis to each movement signature, and the counter for the movement signature observed every time is used to develop
Histogram indicates that the movement signature observed every time occurs being incremented by later each.Most common movement can be signed and be added
Into the database of known movement signature, and sign in real time with following movement when intelligent dwelling device receives them
It is compared.
The letter that known movement in its database can also be signed and be received from new movement signature by intelligent dwelling device
Breath combination.For example, from central management server receive movement signature can include ordinary people time requirement (for example, people exists
The speed moved from left to right in front of thermostat).But specific intelligent dwelling device is possibly mounted at old occupant's
In family, their movement speed requires slow than average time.Intelligent dwelling device can identify it is existing movement signature in arrival/
Pattern is left, and adjustment time is required to match relatively slow/fast speed of specific occupant in its installation site.It is thus known that
The database for moving signature can include the signature received from central management server, the label locally recorded by intelligent dwelling device
Name and when the two signature be dynamically adjusted to match specific user's feature when the two signature combinations signature.
Can by the processing system of intelligent dwelling device handle will receive movement signature with it is known movement sign into
Row compares.Alternatively or in addition, the movement received can be signed and is sent to central management server to carry out remote processing,
Then intelligent dwelling device can be transmitted the response to.Because intelligent dwelling device in the present invention by Local wireless network and
Internet is connected to central management server, it is possible to which advanced processing and statistical analysis are transmitted to central management service
Device usually has the processing capacity of bigger at central management server.This is for using low-power processor and with limited
The intelligent dwelling device (such as hazard detector) of memory storage capability may be particularly advantageous.
It can be accurate or approximate that the movement received signature is carried out matched process with known movement signature.
For example, device may need exact channel response sequence, while time requirement being allowed to change in bandpass range.This will allow
User by the identical sequence before intelligent dwelling device faster/more slowly move, and still generate will be identified that it is identical dynamic
Make the content of sequence.In other cases, it is known that movement signature should be receive movement signature subset.These are implemented
Example covers the case where more than one user is in the range of the proximity sensor of near field.Channel response can caused by first user
It can interlock with channel response caused by second user.As long as movement sign in occur the sequence identified in order, so that it may with
The sequence is extracted and identifies in known movement signature database.For example, as long as ARR_L, ARR_R and DEP_R are sequentially gone out with this
Now in movement signature and with correctly timing, even if then processing system other channel responses caused by another user
(for example, ARR_C) is equally present in the movement that can be also identified in movement signature from left to right.
If the movement signature received is mismatched with known movement signature, can be activated close to scheme using acquiescence
The user interface of intelligent dwelling device and/or the other operations (1806) of execution.Acquiescence all will simply can be led to close to scheme
Road responds averaging/addition together, to determine whether user comes into the specified range of intelligent dwelling device, then accordingly
It takes action on ground.But if the movement signature received matches with known movement signature, more advanced behaviour can be executed
Make.Each known movement signature can also store together with the instruction of user view.For example, above-mentioned movement from left to right
Signature can together be stored with following instruction：This movement signature seldom corresponds to user view and uses intelligent dwelling device, but
It only passes by corresponding to user intelligent dwelling device.This instruction can be stored as single position in some embodiments, or other
Statistics percentage is stored as in embodiment.Movement signature can should be construed to make by statistics percentage in intelligent dwelling device
It is compared with identified threshold percentage in the case of the intention of device.It signs for all movements, it can be by upward
Or threshold value is adjusted downwards, it is more or less reacted so that intelligent dwelling device is close to user.Some users may prefer to
Intelligent dwelling device often activates.In contrast, some users may prefer to intelligent dwelling device save energy, and and if only if
User wants just to activate device when the possibility interacted with device is very big.
As other systems on intelligent dwelling device, move signature detection and recognizer can be dynamic update and
Data are stored preferably to identify the learning algorithm of user view.If the movement signature and the known movement that receive are signed
Matching, and known movement signature instruction user view is interacted with device, then can activate device.Whether user can be based on
The instruction for the user view that reality is updated with device interaction and known movement signature stores together.For example, if user not
It is interacted with device, then algorithm can indicate that the percentage that user view uses moves signature come " punishment " by reduction.Similarly,
If user interacts with device really, the algorithm can indicate the percentage that uses of user view come " reinforcement " by raising
Movement signature.As time goes by, may increase for the known movement signature database of intelligent dwelling device, with accurately
Prediction instruction is using the user movement sequence being intended to, so as to optimize power saving and can maximize user experience.
By accessing the intention stored together with each known movement signature using instruction, intelligent dwelling device therefore can
To determine whether take action (1808).If being intended to be less than threshold percentage using instruction or indicating this in other ways
Movement signature can not possibly indicate to be intended to use, then intelligent dwelling device can avoid taking row by being maintained at inactive state
Dynamic (1810).On the other hand, when intention indicates higher than threshold percentage or that in other ways this movement signature is possible using instruction
It indicates to be intended in use, intelligent dwelling device can take action by activating the system of such as user interface etc
(1812)。
Figure 19 shows in accordance with some embodiments for continuous processing after initiating response action in intelligent dwelling device
Move the flow chart 1900 of the method for signature.In this stage, it is assumed that intelligent dwelling device has been detected by and instruction user view
The movement of the known movement signatures match used is signed.As an example, it is also supposed that the user interface of intelligent dwelling device is pre-
The user of phase to prediction is activated when interacting.However, the case where user changes mind or deviates prediction action in other ways
Under, re -training prediction algorithm as described above is not only wanted, but also intelligent dwelling device is also possible to take correction action to pass through example
It such as closes user interface and carrys out the activation of reverse system in response to incorrect prediction.
Under normal conditions, user interface can keep 10 seconds to 30 seconds intervals upon activation.Mistakenly know in movement signature
It Yi Tu not be in the case of use, even if be never intended to can be whole herein if interacting user interface with intelligent dwelling device by user
Active state is kept in a interval.But using above-mentioned multichannel near field proximity sensor, intelligent dwelling device can quickly be rung
Such case is answered, with energy saving and not dispersion user attention.For example, motion sequence ARR_L, ARR_R can be indicated
User is from the left side close to intelligent dwelling device.Based on the identification of this movement signature, and based on history training instruction 75%
Time can be intended to interact with thermostat when user is close from left side, can be with activated user interface.
At this point, the method can include the variation (1902) in detection proximity sensor reading.These transformation may wrap
The special modality response far from device of the user containing instruction.For example, any one of DEP_R, DEP_L and/or DEP_C can
To indicate that user has moved away from thermostat.If the variation in proximity sensor reading indicates user far from device
(1904), then correction can be taken to act.For example, user interface can switch back immediately to inactive state (1908).This function permits
Perhaps intelligent dwelling device by opening user interface to user close to device when it is very sensitive, while when being left to user nor
It is often sensitive.Once intelligent dwelling device identifies user interface by erroneous activation, user interface will be deactivated.In certain situations
Under, user interface will show the temperature in information, such as thermostat.When user moves towards device, they, which may only wonder, works as
Preceding set point temperatures.This algorithm allows intelligent dwelling device quick response and shows the information useful to user.When according to next
When from the channel of near field proximity sensor, reading knows clearly user far from intelligent dwelling device, user interface can be by
It deactivates, because user is less likely to use these information when leaving intelligent dwelling device.
If variation does not indicate that user far from device, user interface may remain in active state (1906).
There may be the responses unrelated with user in channel on sensor.For example, another user may be in the model of intelligent dwelling device
Enclose interior movement, the user interacted with intelligent dwelling device may slightly move back and forth him between left and right and central response area
Body, etc..Unless far from intelligent dwelling device, otherwise the variation of proximity sensor reading clearly illustrates user

The hand of user is lifted to the left.
Figure 21 shows the flow chart of the method in accordance with some embodiments that gesture is explained using multichannel proximity sensor
2100.The method can include the interaction (2102) of detection and device users interface.It is (such as rotatable with user interface elements
Ring, pointing device etc.) this interaction can be indicated to intelligent dwelling device：The input that proximity sensor receives near field is answered
It is interpreted order rather than is construed to a part for the movement signature of instruction user's movement.At this point, intelligent dwelling device is known
User is just intended to interact with device, therefore it can be transformed into this new operation mode without misreading user view.
The method can also include proximity sensor region movement (2104) of the detection during being interacted with device.As above
Described, this region movement can include the suitable of the sequence trigger switch of left area and right area, upper area and lower area
Sequence triggers or the sequence trigger switch in all four regions of instruction circular motion.It should be understood that the region movement of these types and hand
Gesture is only exemplary, and the larger body gesture for showing to can be used for controlling intelligent dwelling device.Therefore, affiliated neck
The technical staff in domain will be understood that according to the present invention, can use other gestures as indicated by the layout of particular user interface.Example
Such as, some user interfaces can use diagonal rolling movement rather than circumference rolling movement, this will by left/upper region followed by
The sequence trigger switch in right/lower region indicates.
It, can be by the region response of interactive user interface ession for telecommunication in a manner of similar to signature is moved known to detection
Known region response with instruction gesture command is compared (2106).As set forth above, it is possible to be downloaded from central management server
The database of known gesture trains the database for learning known gesture in session from user, and/or by being used with one or more
The database of known gesture is examined in the history interaction at family from in-motion viewing.If it is observed that region movement and known gesture phase
Match, then known gesture can be interpreted order, and can be changed (2110) to user interface according to gesture.Or
Person, if region movement mismatches any known gesture corresponding with user interface command, intelligent dwelling device can neglect
The slightly movement (2108).Alternatively, intelligent dwelling device can convert back previous operation mode, wherein multichannel near field is close passes
Region response is construed to user's movement and generates movement signature by sensor.When user terminates its interactive session with thermostat simultaneously
When leaving, it is possible that such case.
It should be understood that particular step shown in Figure 21 provides the spy of explanation gesture according to various embodiments of the present invention

Figure 22 shows data of the use in accordance with some embodiments from more than one intelligent dwelling device to track use
It moves at family.Intelligent apparatus environment generally comprises multiple intelligent dwelling devices.For example, hazard detector 2202 and thermostat 2204 can
To install in the same room.In general, user will install thermostat 2204 in their corridor, slightly in its hazard detector
The lower section of 2202 positions installed.Each intelligent dwelling device can be equipped with the proximity sensor of their own.When multiple devices
On two or more proximity sensors visual field overlapping when, channel response information can be transferred to from a device another
A device.These information can be used for strengthening explanation of one or more devices to movement signature.
In some embodiments, the first user can close to thermostat 2204 so as to user interface interaction.Thermostat
2204 can start to receive the close response of first user of instruction in the various channels from multichannel proximity sensor.Together
When, second user can also enter the visual field of the multichannel proximity sensor of thermostat 2204.In some cases, such case
Chaotic result may be brought to thermostat 2204.Multiple users may show as the single use for being not close to thermostat 2204
Family.However, the proximity sensor response from hazard detector 2202 can be used for explaining the mould received by thermostat 2204
Paste result.For example, if the first user 2206 is in the visual field of hazard detector 2202 and second user (not shown) exists
Outside the visual field of hazard detector 2202, then the movement signature of the first user 2206 will be specific, such as 2202 institute of hazard detector
See.The movement that hazard detector 2202 will be seen that the first user 2206 close to thermostat 2204 is signed.Hazard detector 2202 is right
After this information can be transferred to thermostat 2204 by local intelligent residential device network.Use this information, thermostat 2204
It can ignore and receive the proximity sensor region response not being consistent with movement signature from hazard detector 2202.With this side
The movement of the first user 2206 moved and ignore second user (not shown) can be isolated in formula, thermostat 2204.
In other embodiments, the proximity sensor from other intelligent dwelling devices can be used to read to determine constant temperature
The automatic leave state of device 2204.In some cases, when having occupant in manager, thermostat 2204 can be located at and be not subjected to frequency
In numerous region walked about.For example, thermostat 2204 may be mounted in the end or the vacant room in corridor.Because such
Thermostat 2204 in position will not see that user moves using its proximity sensor (near field and/or far field), so constant temperature
Device 2204 may be mistakenly into leaving pattern automatically.However, since thermostat 2204 and other intelligent dwelling devices (such as are endangered
Dangerous detector 2202) communication, so other intelligent dwelling devices can share occupied information on intelligent dwelling network.

Signature, identity and/or at a distance from intelligent dwelling device, can change user interface in each case has user to show
Meaning and useful information.
Figure 23 shows the figure of the different user position in accordance with some embodiments relative to intelligent dwelling device 2314
2300.Merely for the purpose of explanation, response range is illustrated as concentric circles.It is real depending on selected specific hardware sensor
Border response range can be ellipse, rectangle, parabola etc..User 2302 is except region 2310 and is therefore considered
Be all proximity sensors on intelligent dwelling device 2314 range except.In general, when user 2302 goes beyond the scope, intelligence
The user interface of energy residential device 2314 will be deactivated, be in sleep pattern or " closing ".When user 2302 lives apart from intelligence
Residence device 2314 is remote enough so that when he/her is not detected by far field proximity sensor, and user 2302 is generally also remote enough
From so that the information shown in the user interface of intelligent dwelling device 2314 will be too small and can not read.However, some are implemented
Example can use other intelligent dwelling devices in enclosure space (for example, in hazard detector, intelligent electric appliance, security system
Wireless module etc.), to detect the user even except the range of the far field proximity sensor of intelligent dwelling device 2314
2302 presence.Therefore, some embodiments can activate the user interface of intelligent dwelling device 2314 to show information, that is, use
Family 2302 is apart from far and cannot be only detected by intelligent dwelling device 2314.
When user 2304 moves in the range of the proximity sensor of far field, some embodiments can be with activated user interface simultaneously

Contrast color or be shown in a manner of device uses by essentially all interface region is shown.In some embodiments
In, icon or figure can be shown on a user interface to absorb the attention of user, it cannot be correct due to too far without showing
The meeting of reading interferes text/digital information of user.The example that far field is shown will be discussed in greater detail below.
When user 2306 enters near field range 2312 and therefore generates response on the proximity sensor of near field, intelligent dwelling
The user interface of device 2314 can change display near field setting.In some embodiments, near field pattern, which is shown, to wrap
Containing smaller font, menu option, text/digital information and/or to the user 2306 closer to intelligent dwelling device 2314 more
Useful other information.In some embodiments, near field show and far field show can be shown by different-format it is roughly the same
Information.For example, it can include that the digital dock amplified is shown, and near field is shown when can include more detailed simulation that far field, which is shown,
Clock is shown.In some embodiments, far field shows the subset for including the information shown in being shown near field.For example, far field is aobvious
Show can include warning icon, and show will be comprising the warning icon filled with text message near field.
As shown in figure 23, some embodiments can have at least three different display options：Close display, far field is shown
It is shown near field.When being moved between response region of the user in the various proximity sensors of intelligent dwelling device 2314, user
It can be converted between each display by corresponding manner at interface.It therefore, can be between each response region of proximity sensor
It is converted in the presence of processing.When intelligent dwelling device 2314 starts to receive the response from far field proximity sensor, can close
Close display and far field show between conversion.Similarly, when intelligent dwelling device 2314 starts to receive from the close sensing near field
When the response of device, can occur near field display and far field show between conversion.
Figure 24 is shown in accordance with some embodiments generates various graphical displays in the user interface of intelligent dwelling device

The type of the information shown on the interface of family, intelligent dwelling device can be analyzed by near field proximity sensor and far field proximity sensor
The response that the two generates together.
The method, which can further include, determines whether that proximity sensor receives instruction (2404) near field.Such as
Fruit is interior at preset time intervals, and near field, proximity sensor does not receive instruction, then user interface can show that far field is shown
(2406).It can occur when in the range of user is in far field proximity sensor but outside the range of near field proximity sensor this
Situation.It should be noted that not ask exactly simultaneous receives instruction near field proximity sensor and far field proximity sensor.Alternatively,
Some embodiments will analysis time interval, such as 10ms, 50ms, 100ms, 500ms, 1s etc., and determine in the time interval
Whether instruction has been received from two proximity sensors.Some embodiments can also be from one in two proximity sensors
Time started interval when receiving instruction, and search and received in the time interval from another in two proximity sensors
Instruction.For example, if far field proximity sensor generates response, this will start the time interval of 100ms.Then, intelligent dwelling
The processing system of device will monitor near field proximity sensor to determine whether the sensor also generates sound in 100ms time intervals
It answers.If the instruction from both far field proximity sensor and near field proximity sensor is generated in interval at the same time,
User's interface display near field can be made to show (2408).
Although not being explicitly illustrated in flow chart 2400, when by near field proximity sensor generate response without by
When generating respective response some cases may occur for far field proximity sensor.For example, do not work in far field proximity sensor or
In the case of being blocked, near field proximity sensor may be unique proximity sensor for generating response.In this case, when from
When near field proximity sensor receives instruction, user interface can show that near field is shown, without coming from far field close to sensing

It crosses and determines which user should determine user at home according to control-time table.In other embodiments, user identity can be with
It is transferred to intelligent dwelling device by other devices in intelligent dwelling network.In some embodiments, the electronics dress that user carries
It sets and can be used for identifying user.For example, the application program run on the smart phone of user can be using GPS information come to intelligence
It can residential device transmission approximate location.RFID tag can be used in another example.Then, intelligent dwelling device can make
With GPS/RFID information and/or information from airborne proximity sensor determines user identity.Other embodiments can use
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Wi-Fi from mobile phone emit to distinguish user.
Some embodiments can distinguish a kind of individual rather than the specific identity of identification.For example, with upper channel and lower logical
The multichannel proximity sensor in road can be used for distinguishing adult and children based on height.Children are usually shorter, and will connect
Strong response is generated on the lower channel of nearly sensor, and smaller response is generated from the upper channel of proximity sensor.Compared to it
Under, adult is usually higher than children, and more identical response between lower channel and upper channel can be caused (to consider lower channel
Any scaling is to exclude pet detection).Intelligent dwelling device can be based on the user detected children or adult come
Different displays is provided.For example, usual couple of children interact with intelligent dwelling device and lose interest in, and it is grown up and is usually more desirable to
Child does not interact with their intelligent dwelling device.Therefore, when detecting children, intelligent dwelling device can close user circle
Face, and one of other user interfaces as described herein are provided when detecting adult.In addition, the lower channel of proximity sensor will
The response of bigger is generated to pet than upper channel.When detecting pet, thermostat can ignore relevant movement.
The method can also include whether the motion feature confirmly detected matches predetermined characteristic (2806).Institute as above
It states, the motion feature detected can be compared with the database of the motion feature of storage.For example, can will sense

The storage feature of connection is compared.Can by the speed of speed and the specific user or user class of user's build and precedence record and
User's build is compared.The database of the motion feature of storage can be downloaded from central management server, be lived in installation intelligence
Training interim study after residence device, and/or come from user as intelligent dwelling device records in the normal operation period
Movement and at any time dynamic update.
The display of user interface can be updated based on whether the motion feature of sensing matches scheduled motion feature.If
Matching is found, then can show the first display (2810).Alternatively, if not showing matching, the display of replacement can be shown
(2808).The display of replacement or the first display may include the closed state of user interface.It should be understood that Figure 28 is merely exemplary
, it is not intended to limit.Other embodiments can use three or more displays, and more letters are received with from user action
Breath, these displays can be changed with increment.
Figure 29 shows Figure 29 00 that progressive alarm in accordance with some embodiments is shown.Multichannel proximity sensor makes intelligence
Residential device, which can distinguish, can indicate that user signs close to the movement of intelligent dwelling device.This method can indicate to use
Family is intended to interact with intelligent dwelling device.Alternatively, such method can indicate that user will he/her should be with intelligence to instruction
The display of residential device interaction is sensitive.In either case, when user is close to intelligent dwelling device, intelligent dwelling device
More information can be progressively provided on a user interface using this information.
Following example assumes that intelligent dwelling device 2908 is generating alarm.It is connect when user enters near field at position 2902
When the response range of nearly sensor 2916, intelligent dwelling device 2908 can generate display 2910, show warning icon.As above
Described, when user enters the response range of far field proximity sensor, the display of this range may be activated.When user leans on
When nearly intelligent dwelling device 2908 is moved to position 2904, intelligent dwelling device 2908 can start to receive close from multichannel
The response of the additional channels of sensor, instruction user just move towards intelligent dwelling device 2908.For example, when user is in position
When 2904, center (up/down) and right channel can generate response.At this point, intelligent dwelling device 2908 can determine that user can
It can be at least sensitive to more information of the displaying in relation to alarm.In response, display 2912 can be presented in intelligent dwelling device 2908,
It starts the text message filling warning icon with description alarm.In this illustration, how therefrom text message can describe
Management server is entreated to receive alarm.
As user continues close to intelligent dwelling device 2908, the additional channels of multichannel proximity sensor will generate response
(for example, left channel, right channel and central passage may start to generate response).In addition, the response rank in each channel can increase
Add threshold quantity (for example, above-mentioned " close " threshold value) of the amplitude higher than expression user close to intelligent dwelling device 2908.When user goes out
When in the interaction distance of present intelligent dwelling device 2908, the text message and menu option that will be provided for alarm can be generated
Display 2914.By gradually increase intelligent dwelling device 2908 display information content, user interface can both attract user after
Continue and is moved to intelligent dwelling device 2908, it can also be readable to user's presentation at a distance from intelligent dwelling device 2908 according to user

Device 2908 interacts so that can read alarm and make a response.
Although being not shown in Figure 29, when intelligent dwelling device 2908 determines that user is not responsive to existing user and shows simultaneously
When far from intelligent dwelling device 2908, replacement display can also be generated.For example, if the user at position 2902 does not respond to
The display 2910 of warning icon moves towards thermostat (for example, user is moved to the left rather than is moved towards intelligent dwelling device 2908
It is dynamic), then intelligent dwelling device 2908 can generate the display for being configured as attracting the user's attention power.For example, display can be changed
2910 so that warning icon starts to flicker or change color.If the movement signature of user continues to indicate that user just ignores intelligence
Residential device 2908 can then close user interface in some embodiments.
