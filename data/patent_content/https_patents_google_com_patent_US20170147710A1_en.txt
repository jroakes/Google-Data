In these situation, a border 280 , or any other grouping indicator, can be used to identify the grouped search results. Additionally, the user device may display, as associated with the grouping of search results, contact information common to each of the particular entities. For example, as shown in FIG. 2A , a toll-free customer service number 282 is displayed. Thus, the user may call either store location by selecting respective search results 260 or 270 , or may call the toll free number by selecting the toll free number 282 .

Abstract
Description
- Users of mobile devices typically do not store phone numbers of businesses in their personal contacts, especially if the business is one that the user infrequently calls. For example, a user may not store a particular restaurant's contact information in his or her contacts. Thus, when the user desires to call the business, the user searches for the business listing using a search application to find the phone number of the business.
- Some phone applications on user devices allow for searching of entities that are not stored in a user's contact file, such as businesses, within the dialer application itself. However, when search results are returned to the user's device, they may often be duplicative or otherwise fail to satisfy the user's informational need. An example of the former, duplicative search results, occurs when a user is searching for the phone number of an entity that has multiple locations, such as in the case of a franchised restaurant. Often the user may need to exit the dialer application and resume searching in a browser application so that the user may find additional information about each particular location, such as times the particular location is open, a map of the location, and so on.
- Likewise, a search result that is not duplicative may also fail to satisfy a user's information need. For example, the dialer application may display a result responsive to the user's query that lists an entity name and address. However, the user may desire other information before placing a call, such as a map of the location at which the entity is located, or user ratings of the entity, etc. Once again, the user must exit the dialer application and resume searching in the browser application to find the additional information the user desires.
- This specification describes technologies relating to search results in a dialer application user interface.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of displaying, on a display of the user device, a user interface environment for a telephone dialing application, the user interface environment including a query input field and a search result display field; displaying, in response to a query provided as input in the query input field, search results responsive to the query, each search result identifying a respective entity determined to be responsive to the query, wherein: a first search result of the search results is initially displayed in a knowledge panel format that provides data describing a first set of fact types for the respective entity determined identified by the first search result, and each remaining search result of the search result is initially displayed in a summary format that provides data describing a second set of fact types for the respective entity identified by the remaining search result, and wherein the second set of fact types is a proper subset of the first set of fact types; receiving an expansion selection of one of the remaining search results, and in response: transforming the display of the first search result from the knowledge panel format to the summary format, transforming the display of the one of the remaining search results from the summary panel format to the knowledge panel format, and receiving a dial selection of one of the search results and in response placing a voice call from the data processing device to the respective entity identified by the one of the search results. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. The providing of additional information in a knowledge panel type format in a dialer application increases the likelihood that a user's informational need may be satisfied without the need to switch to a different application, such as a browser application, which saves the user time. Furthermore, the ability to satisfy a user's informational need within the browser application tends to increase user engagement, as the user is less likely to abandon an attempt to place a call to an entity when the user's focus may stay within the application environment as compared when a user's focus must switch between application environments. And while many browser applications support the ability to place a phone call to an entity listed in a search result or from an entity's home page, a user must nevertheless press or touch a particular phone listing in the result. Many users, however, find it difficult to locate a phone number on a page displayed in a limited display space on mobile device. Thus, users often spend time searching for the phone number on the page, wasting time and effort.
- The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIGS. 2A and 2B are illustrations of a user device displaying multi-format search results in a dialer application user interface. -
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process for processing multi-format search results. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anenvironment 100 in which auser device 106, such as a mobile device, may support multi-format search results in a dialer application. Acomputer network 102, such as the Internet, or a combination thereof, provides for data communication between electronic devices and systems. Thecomputer network 102 may also include, or be in data communication with, one or morewireless networks 103 by means of one or more gateways. - The
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under the control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102, establishing communication channels, e.g., voice communications, with other user devices, and also capable of performing other actions.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. In the example ofFIG. 1 , theuser device 106 is a smart phone. Theuser device 106 may communicate over thenetworks networks - A
web site 104 is one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example web site is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, e.g., scripts. Eachweb site 104 is maintained by a publisher, e.g., an entity that manages and/or owns the web site. - A resource 105 is data provided over the
network 102 and that is associated with a resource address, e.g., a uniform resource locator. Resources 105 that can be provided by aweb site 104 include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name just a few. The resources 105 can include content, e.g., words, phrases, images and sounds and may include embedded information, e.g., meta information and hyperlinks, and/or embedded instructions, e.g., scripts. - To facilitate searching of resources 105, the
search system 120 identifies the resources 105 by crawling and indexing the resources 105 provided onweb sites 104. Data about the resources 105 can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 105 are stored in asearch index 122. - The
search system 120 may derive from the search index 122 aknowledge graph 124. Theknowledge graph 124 is a representation of relationships between entities and facts in the forms of nodes and edges. Each node in the knowledge graph represents a different entity, and pairs of nodes in the knowledge graph are connected by one or more edges. Each edge representing a relationship dimension that defines a relationship between the two entities represented by the pair of nodes, or several edges represent a series of relationships that connect two entities by one or more intermediate entities. - The
search system 120 can access theknowledge graph 124 and generate knowledge panels. A knowledge panel is a user interface element that provides information or other content related to a particular entity, such as a person, business entity, place, country, landmark, animal, historical event, organization, sports team, sporting event, movie, song, album, game, work of art, or any other entity. Typically a knowledge panel provides a summary of information for the entity. For example, a knowledge panel for a business may include the address of the business, a phone number, images of the business, and customer reviews of the business, and so on. Other types of information and content can also be presented in the knowledge panel. - The content of a knowledge panel may include content published or otherwise provided by multiple resources, such as multiple web pages. For example, a knowledge panel for a landmark may include an image of the landmark that has been published on a first web page that is hosted by a first publisher. The knowledge panel may also include a set of facts about the landmark that have been published on a second web page published by a second publisher different from the first publisher.
- A user may provide search queries to the
search system 120 and receive search results in response to the query. The content of the search result may depend on what application is used by theuser device 106 for submitting queries to search thesearch index 122. For example, when a browser is used to submit the query, the search result identifies a resource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource 105. An example search result in this situation includes a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page. - However, when a phone dialer application is used, the search result instead includes a name of an entity, a location, and data that causes the
mobile device 106 to place a call to the entity when the search result is selected at the user device. Furthermore, as will be described below with reference toFIGS. 2A, 2B and 3 , when thesearch system 120 receives a query from the dialer application (as indicated by metadata provided with the search query), thesearch system 120 may provide the search results in different formats. A first format is a knowledge panel format, and a second format is a summary format. -
FIGS. 2A and 2B are illustrations of auser device 200 displaying multi-format search results 210, 230, 250, 260 and 270 in a dialerapplication user interface 202. The processing of the search results 210, 230, 250, 260 and 270 inFIGS. 2A and 2B is also described with reference toFIG. 3 , which is a flow diagram of anexample process 300 for processing multi-format search results. Theprocess 300 is implemented in a user device, such as theuser device 200, by use of instructions that cause the user device to display the described features on a user interface and to perform the described functions in response to user interactions with the user interface. - The
process 300 displays, on a display of the user device, a user interface environment for a telephone dialing application, the user interface environment including a query input field and a search result display field (302). As illustrated inFIG. 2A , auser interface 202 of a dialer application is displayed. As used herein, a dialer application differs from a browser application in that the dialer application is configured to place a phone call to an entity referenced by a search result in response to a selection of a search result. Typically such functionality is supported by a browser application only when a user selects contact data—such as a phone number—that can be resolved to place a phone call. - The user interface includes an
input field 206. Within theinput field 206 the query [French] 208 has been entered by a user as input. Theprocess 300 displays, in response to the query provided as input in the query input field, a first search result that is initially displayed in a knowledge panel format (304), and other search results that are each initially displayed in a summary format (306). As illustrated inFIG. 2A , thesearch result 210 is displayed in the knowledge panel format, and theother search results - Each search result shown in
FIG. 2A identifies a respective entity determined to be responsive to thequery 208. Thesearch result 210 is initially displayed in the knowledge panel format that provides data describing a first set of fact types for the respective entity determined identified by thefirst search result 210. Each of the remainingsearch results FIG. 2A thefirst search result 210, when displayed in a knowledge panel format, includes the name and address 212 of the entity, images related to the entity (e.g., pictures of products, employees, etc.),map data 216 that, which selected, may display a map of the location of the entity, and other information, such as areview 218 and thephone number 220. The remainingsearch results address data - Each search result includes a
first icon 222 that toggles the display format and the search result between the summary format and the knowledge panel format. As shown inFIG. 2A , thefirst icon 222 includes a “−” symbol, which indicates thesearch result 210 will be collapsed upon selection of the first icon. Thefirst icons - In some implementations, a selection of any location of a search result in summary form, other than the first icon, results in a dial selection of the search result, which causes the
user device 200 to place a voice call to the respective entity identified by the search result. However, in some implementations, a separate second icon, such asicons - In some implementations, the search result displayed in the knowledge panel format may be subject to the same user interaction model as a search result displayed in a summary format, i.e., a selection of any location of the search result, other than the first icon, results in a dial selection of the search result; or only a selection of the second icon causes the user device to place the voice call if a second icon is displayed.
- In still other implementations, each displayed
element - In some implementations, only one search result may be displayed in the knowledge panel format at any one time. Thus, when one search result is expanded, any other search result displayed in the knowledge panel format is transformed into a summary format. This is shown with reference to
FIG. 2B . To generate the display ofFIG. 2B , theprocess 300 receives an expansion selection of one of the search results displayed in the summary format (308). For example, assume the user selects theicon 232 of thesearch result 230. - The
process 300 transforms the display of the first search result from the knowledge panel format to the summary format (310), and 300 transforms the display of the search result selected by the expansion selection from the summary format to the knowledge panel format (312). For example, as shown inFIG. 2B , thesearch result 210 is now displayed in the summary format, and thesearch result 230 is displayed in the knowledge panel format withdata elements search result images 234, the search result could include a menu item and a price. - The
process 300 receives a dial selection of one of the search results and in response places a voice call from the data processing device to the respective entity identified by the one of the search results (314). For example, a user may select thesearch result 250, e.g., by pressing theaddress data 252, which causes theuser device 200 to place a voice call to the entity “French Restaurant.” - In some implementations, the
user device 200 groups search results that each describe a respectively different sets of contact information for a particular entity. For example, as shown inFIGS. 2A and 2B , the search results 260 and 270 both relate to franchise locations of a particular store. In these situation, aborder 280, or any other grouping indicator, can be used to identify the grouped search results. Additionally, the user device may display, as associated with the grouping of search results, contact information common to each of the particular entities. For example, as shown inFIG. 2A , a toll-freecustomer service number 282 is displayed. Thus, the user may call either store location by selectingrespective search results free number 282. - Embodiments of the subject matter and the functional operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, in tangibly-embodied computer software or firmware, in computer hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a tangible non-transitory computer storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. The computer storage medium can be a machine-readable storage device, a machine-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory device, or a combination of one or more of them. The computer program may include multiple files, and may be deployed to execute one or more data processing apparatus.
- The term “data processing apparatus” encompasses all kinds of apparatus, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a computer, special-purpose circuitry, or multiple processors or computers. The apparatus can also include, in addition to hardware, code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, or a combination of one or more of them.
