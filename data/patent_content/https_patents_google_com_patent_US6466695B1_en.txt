- an object representation is created automatically from an image and then this representation is applied to another image for the purpose of object recognition.
- the features used for the representation are the two types of two-dimensional shape primitives: local line segments and vertices.

- the invention relates to the automatic creation of an object representation in accordance with the process shown in FIG. 1.
- a greylevel image (or the intensity image computed from a color image) is taken as input.
- a feature type two dimensional shape primitive is extracted.
- Two peculiarities of this feature type may include local line segments and vertices. Local line segments are straight or curved lines of small extent; vertices are junctions of line segments. Vertices can be corners (symbolized by the character L) or more complex ones which have a shape similar to the characters T, Y, X, or K, or consist of even more edges which ‘meet’ at a certain location.
- the feature extraction leads to a set of two-dimensional shape primitives, containing location and parameters of the feature (e.g., direction of the line) for every two-dimensional shape primitive.
- the set as such is a representation of the object presented in the image.
- the object is represented in a more sophisticated manner by the help of an undirected graph.
- the nodes of the graph are labeled with the detected features and the edges of the graph are labeled with the distance vectors between the features. Since the object representation is created from a single image, it is referred to as one-shot learning in the following.
- This algorithm is based on the computation of the similarity between a feature given at a node of a graph and a feature extracted at some location in the image. Therefore such similarity functions are defined for both local line segments and vertices in this invention.
- the result of EGM is the location of the object in the image and furthermore the locations of the nodes of the graph. If not only one but a set of object representations is given EGM computes which object fits best to the object given in the image.
- the process according to the invention also contains an improvement on one-shot learning.
- the object representation created by one-shot learning will contain ‘unwanted’ features (e.g., features referring to the background or/and the shades of the illumination).
- the object representation can be learning from a sequence of images in which the object remains unchanged but the scene (e.g., background or/and illumination) changes (see FIG. 3 ). This so-called iterative learning detects reliable features of the object.
- This section describes how the two peculiarities local line segment and vertex of the feature type two-dimensional shape primitive are extracted from a gray-level image (or the intensity image computed from a color image).
- the extraction of local line segments consists of following three steps (see FIG. 4 ): First, the given image is convolved with a set of generalized Gabor filters called banana filters. The magnitudes of these complex-valued responses are taken as input for the next step. There exists a vector of resulting values at every pixel position, one coefficient for every filter of the set of filters. Second, the resulting values are normalized. Third, the normalized values are sparsified by, roughly speaking, computing local maxima. Since these local maxima are the output of this step, the output only contains values at some and not at all pixel locations. Thus, the output is a set of local line segments described by their confidence, their location and the attributes frequency, orientation, curvature, and elongation. After two definitions the algorithm is explained in detail in the following:
- FIG. 8 shows the magnitude of the responses of the banana filters in FIG. 7 applied to the image in FIG. 6 .
- ⁇ norm ( . . . ) normalizes the real valued filter responses r( ⁇ right arrow over (c) ⁇ )into the interval [0, 1]
- This normalization is based on the “Above Average Criterion” AAC: a line segment corresponding to the banana wavelet c is present if the corresponding banana wavelet response is distinctly above the average response.
- an average response is defined by considering the average response in the complete feature space and also in a local area of the feature space. Therefore, a global and a local normalization are performed.
- a mean total response is defined as E local ( ⁇ right arrow over (x) ⁇ 0 , ⁇ 0 , I) for the ⁇ 0 -th level at pixel position ⁇ right arrow over (x) ⁇ 0 and the mean total response for the ⁇ 0 -th level E total ( ⁇ 0 ) of the banana space by
- A( ⁇ right arrow over (x) ⁇ 0 , r E ) represents the cuboid square with center ⁇ right arrow over (x) ⁇ 0 and edge length r E in the (x, y) space.
- I represents a set of arbitrary natural images and B is the full set of discrete banana wavelets at one pixel position.
- the function E( ⁇ right arrow over (x) ⁇ 0 , ⁇ 0 , I) has high values when there is structure in the local area around ⁇ right arrow over (x) ⁇ 0 .
- the normalization function starts to increase for values larger than ⁇ 1 E (I, ⁇ 0 , ⁇ right arrow over (x) ⁇ 0 ) and becomes almost flat for values higher than ⁇ 2 E(I, ⁇ 0 , ⁇ right arrow over (x) ⁇ 0 ).
- ⁇ norm (r( ⁇ right arrow over (c) ⁇ )) represents the system's confidence of the presence of the feature ⁇ right arrow over (b) ⁇ at position ⁇ right arrow over (x) ⁇ 0 . This confidence is high when the response exceeds the average activity significantly. The exact value of the response is not of interest. However, a range of indecision of the system when the response is only slightly above the average activity is still allowed to avoid a very strict decision at this stage.
- the transformation is reduced to a small set of filter responses with positive values, all other filter responses are set to zero.
- the transformed image is divided in space-orientation bins ⁇ (x, y, ⁇ 0 , ⁇ ).
- the output of this final step of the extraction is a set U of those local line segments whose sparsified response S( ⁇ right arrow over (c) ⁇ ) is larger than the threshold ⁇ .
- the set is
- N is the number of elements in the set.
- the extraction of vertices from an image I is done in two steps, first detection and then identification.
- the detection is done by a standard algorithm, such as: Rolf P. Würtz and Tino Lourens. “Corner detection in color images by multiscale combination of end-stopped cortical cells”, In Proceedings of the ICANN 1997, 1997. (this algorithm is based on end-stopped cells), and results in a set of vertex locations
- N is the number of detected locations.
- the directions of the edges of every detected vertex are determined.
- a confidence value c is computed for every edge.
- a vertex is defined by its location ⁇ right arrow over (x) ⁇ and a set of N edges ( ⁇ ) edges. Every edge j is given by its direction ⁇ j and its confidence c j .
- the ⁇ -th vertex ⁇ ⁇ reads
- ⁇ ⁇ ( ⁇ right arrow over (x) ⁇ ⁇ ; ⁇ ( ⁇ j ( ⁇ ) ,c j ( ⁇ ) ) ⁇ ) (12)
- V ⁇ 0 , ⁇ 1 , . . . , ⁇ N ⁇ 1 ⁇ . (13)
- FIGS. 12 a - 12 c shows some examples of vertices detected and identified from images.
- the length of the lines indicates the confidence of the corresponding vertex edge.
- the left vertical edge of the brick has not been detected because the gray value of the background and that of the corresponding plane of the brick are equal.
- an accidental vertex is detected (see right arrow).
- the angle ⁇ i determines the banana filter taken at point ⁇ right arrow over (p) ⁇ i in the following way: the orientation of the frequency of the filter is ⁇ i ⁇ /2 or, if not available in the applied set of filters, that direction which is closest to it.
- the response of the filters corresponding to the points are computed and the magnitudes m′ i of the complex-valued filter responses are compiled in a vector
- the next step for estimating an edge direction is to find local maxima in ⁇ right arrow over (m) ⁇ .
- the resulting set of indices of local maxima is
- the precision of the direction of every edge can be increased by considering the magnitudes of those directions which are near to the direction ⁇ i of the local maximum.
- i + +with i + >i The resulting values i ⁇ and i + allow to compute a second estimate of the direction of the vertex edge: ( ⁇ i ⁇ .+ ⁇ i+ )/2. This procedure can be done for several values ⁇ l (l ⁇ 0,1, . . .
- edges may be improved by considering the surrounding of a vertex.
- the identification of the edges of a vertex can be improved (a) by considering several circles with different radii r l instead of only one, (b) by considering different frequency levels of banana filters at one circle, or (c) by a combination of both variations (a) and (b).
- One certain choice of radii r l and frequency levels k l is to adapt the radius to the size of the banana filters in a way which can be described as “the smaller the filter the smaller the radius”:
- ⁇ (l) ( ⁇ right arrow over (x) ⁇ ; ⁇ ( ⁇ i (l) ,m i (l) )
- edges are considered which have at least N neighbour neighbours at other combinations l. Two edges are considered as neighbours if they have similar angles.
- the estimation of the angle of an edge is improved by computing the mean angle of all neighbours.
- the confidence is also improved by computing the mean value.
- ( ⁇ , ⁇ ) is defined such that it takes the one-dimensional circular space of angles into consideration (e.g., the distance of the angles 0.1 ⁇ 2 ⁇ and 0.9 ⁇ 2 ⁇ will be 0.2 ⁇ 2 ⁇ and not 0.8 ⁇ 2 ⁇ ):
- the set of neighbours of ⁇ i (l) of the edge ( ⁇ i (l) , m i (l) ) is determined by
- ⁇ i (l) ⁇ ( ⁇ i′ (l′) , m i′ (l′) )
- ⁇ _ i ( l ) ⁇ i ( l ) + 1 ⁇ ⁇ i ( l ) ⁇ + 1 ⁇ ⁇ ( ⁇ ′ , m ′ ) ⁇ ⁇ i ( l ) ⁇ ⁇ f ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( a i ( l ) , ⁇ ′ ) ( 29 ) m _ i ( l ) + 1 ⁇ ⁇ i ( l ) ⁇ + 1 ⁇ ( m i ( l ) + ⁇ ( ⁇ ′ , m ′ ) ⁇ ⁇ i ( l ) ⁇ m ′ ) ( 30 )
- the set of improved edges ⁇ ′ only contains those edges, as already mentioned, which have at least N neighbour neighbours at other combinations l
- ⁇ ′ ⁇ ( ⁇ overscore ( ⁇ ) ⁇ (l) , ⁇ overscore (m) ⁇ i (l) )
- the final set ⁇ of improved edges is computed from ⁇ ′ by copying one edge after the other from ⁇ ′ to ⁇ and dropping all those edges whose angle has a smaller distance than ⁇ ⁇ to the angle of an edge which has already been copied. (The distance is, of course, measured by ⁇
- One-shot learning of an object representation is based on the set of extracted features; U for local line segments and V for vertices (see eqns. (6) and (13), respectively).
- this set is represented by a graph. This allows to apply elastic graph matching for object recognition (described below).
- the nodes of the graph are labeled with the features and the edges of the graph are labeled with distance vectors to store the spatial distance between the nodes.
- a graph is created in the way that for every feature in the set a separate node is used, so that every node is labeled with only one feature.
- edges of the graph the nodes are located in a two dimensional space at the positions given by the features labeled at the nodes.
- edges are created either as a minimum spanning tree or as a triangulation. Every resulting edge is labeled with a distance vector computed from the positions of the two nodes the edge in question connects.
- a rectangular grid is taken as graph. This grid is of same size as the considered image. It is located on the image whereby every node refers to a certain pixel position. A node of this graph is labeled with all those features the locations of which are closest to this node and not to another one. Thus a node can contain more than one feature, or also no feature.
- the resulting graph contains nodes labeled with local line segments, nodes labels with vertices, and also nodes labeled with both types of features.
- a typical parameter choice of the distance of adjacent nodes in a grid graph is 11 pixels.
- Iterative learning of an object representation may use a feature-independent description.
- a representation learned by one-shot learning may contain features belonging to the background or to shades caused by the illumination. To get rid of these features the reliability of the features can be determinated in a sequence of images. Furthermore, features which are missing in the representation, because of, for instance, abnormal lighting conditions, can be added during the processing of the sequence (see FIG. 12 b ).
- the following algorithm shows how a reliable object representation can be learned step-by-step on the condition that the object remains at the same location in the sequence and that the background and the illumination varies.
- the representation consists of a set of features A i and a confidence value c i for every feature. Every feature-confidence unit (A i , c i ) is considered as a candidate for the resulting representation.
- an adaptation function a′ ⁇ adapt (a; b, r). Its resulting feature a′ is the feature a adapted to the second feature b.
- the extent of the adaptation is given by the value r ⁇ [0; 1].
- Those candidates which are similar to an input feature are strengthened, i.e., their confidence is increased. Furthermore, the candidate is adapted towards the input feature to a certain extend.
- a i ( t+ 1) ⁇ adapt ( A i ( t ); a j ( t ), r ) (54)
- the set of candidates is enlarged by those input features which are not similar to a candidate. Their confidence is set to an initial value c init (t). This implies that at the beginning of the iterative learning procedure all input features become a candidate.
- a i ( t+ 1) ⁇ adapt ( A i ( t ); A j ( t ), r ) (60)
- An object representation R can be determined and extracted at any point of time in the sequence and, of course, also at the end of the sequence. It is the set of those candidates the confidences of which are higher than a given threshold C reliable (t) ⁇ [C min (t), C max ]
- a distance measure is defined for the orientation-curvature subspace ( ⁇ , c) expressing the Moebius topology thereof.
- ⁇ , c orientation-curvature subspace
- (e x ,e y ,e ⁇ ,e ⁇ ,e c ,e s ) define a cube of volume I in the feature space, i.e., the distance function is defined such that the vector (e x ,e y ,e ⁇ ,e ⁇ ,e c ,e s ) has norm 1.
- d ⁇ ( c ⁇ 1 , c ⁇ 2 ) ( ( x 1 - x 2 ) 2 e x 2 + ( y 1 - y 2 ) 2 e y 2 + ⁇ ( f 1 - f 2 ) 2 e f 2 + d ⁇ ( ( ⁇ 1 , c 1 ) , ( ⁇ 2 , c 2 ) ) 2 + ( s 1 - s 2 ) 2 e s 2 ) 1 / 2 ⁇ ( 79 )
- the parameter (e x ,e y ,e ⁇ ,e ⁇ ,e c ,e s ) determines the distances in each one-dimensional subspace. A smaller value indicates a stretching of this space.
- the distance and adaptation function for the vertices is now defined.
- the distance function first finds out which edge of the first vertex belongs to which edge of the second one (every edge can only be ‘used’ once). Based on these pairs of edges and, if there exist some, based on those edges which do not belong to edge-pairs the distance value is computed in the following way: the more similar the directions of the edge-pairs are and the more similar their confidences are the smaller the value of the distance function will be. Edges which do not belong to edge-pairs increase the resulting value.
- the distance function of two vertices is based on the distance f
- the first step is to find out which edges of the two considered vertices ⁇ (1) and ⁇ (2) belong to each other. Let these two vertices be given as
- ⁇ (1) is the set of edges, described by angle-confidence pairs, of the first vertex;
- These sets may contain a different number of entries.
- the first edge-pair consists of those two edges which are closest to each other.
- the second edge-pair is determined in the same way, however, the edges which already belong to the first edge-pair are ignored now. Continue this way until either the first or the second vertex does not contain an ‘unused’ edge any more.
- N (1) ( ⁇ (1) ⁇ circumflex over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ (1) )
- N (2) ( ⁇ (2) ⁇ circumflex over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ (2) )
- N (1) and N (2) contains all the edge-pairs of the two vertices, N (1) and N (2) , all those edges of the first and second vertex which have not been used for the edge-pairs, respectively.
- N (1) or N (2) is empty.
- the definition of the adaptation function is based on the two sets P and N (1) introduced above.
- the adaptation consists of two different cases: (1) the edges of ⁇ (1) which belong to an edge-pair are adapted to the corresponding edge of ⁇ (2) , (2) the other edges in ⁇ (1) (given in N (1) ) get their confidences reduced.
- the location ⁇ right arrow over (x) ⁇ (1) of ⁇ (1) is adapted to the location of the other vertex in a linear way.
- the object representations extracted from one image by one shot learning or from an image sequence by iterative learning can be used for object recognition.
- the object coded by a graph G labeled with local line segments, vertices or both can be recognized in an unknown image I by using elastic graph matching (EGM) (see, Martin Lades, Jan C. Vorbrüggen, Joachim Buhmann, Jörg Lange, Christoph v.d. Malsburg, Rolf P. Würtz, and Wolfgang Konen. Distortion invariant object recognition in the dynamic link architecture. IEEE Trans. Comput., 42(3):300 311, 1993.
- Elastic graph matching may be accomplished using local line segments.
- Elastic graph matching may be accomplished using vertices.
- the preprocessed image data a ( ⁇ right arrow over (x) ⁇ ) is the vertex extracted as described in section 3.2.
- a( ⁇ right arrow over (x) ⁇ ) is represented as in eqn. (14)
- Elastic Graph Matching may be accomplished using both local line segments and vertices.
- a graph may not only contain one type of feature but can rather contain local line segments as well as vertices. Both is possible within one graph, first, that a node contains both types of features or, second, that a node contains either type of feature.
- the corresponding data a( ⁇ right arrow over (x) ⁇ ) has to be extracted from the image and the corresponding similarity function S(G k , a( ⁇ right arrow over (x) ⁇ )) has to be applied.
