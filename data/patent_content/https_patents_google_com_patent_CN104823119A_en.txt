Abstract
Embodiments of the invention describe thermostats that use model predictive controls and related methods. A method of controlling a thermostat using a model predictive control may involve determining a parameterized model. The parameterized model may be used to predicted ambient temperature values for an enclosure. A set of radiant heating system control strategies may be selected for evaluation to determine an optimal control strategy from the set of control strategies. To determine the optimal control strategy, a predictive algorithm may be executed, in which each control strategy is applied to the parameterized model to predict an ambient temperature trajectory and each ambient temperature trajectory is processed in view of a predetermined assessment function. Processing the ambient temperature trajectory in this manner may involve minimizing a cost value associated with the ambient temperature trajectory. The radiant heating system may subsequently be controlled according to the selected optimal control strategy.
Description
Technical field
Patent specification relates to for controlling heating system with by overshoot effect and the minimized system and method for undershoot effect.More particularly, patent specification relates to control module, and the operation of described control module management energy consumption system, apparatus for household use or other resource consumption systems, comprises the system and method for controlling heating ventilation and artificial atmosphere (HVAC) system.
Background technology
A large amount of effort and notice continue to be directed to development renewal, more continuable energy supply.Remain vital future by improving the energy efficiency energy-conservation energy for the whole world.According to the report in the October, 2010 from USDOE, in typical American family, heat supply and refrigeration occupy 56% of energy use, thus make it for most of family, become maximum energy-consuming.Along with to domestic heat and the improvement (such as, the insulation of improvement, more high efficiency stove) of relevant physical equipment of freezing, by control and management domestic heat and refrigeration plant better, can realize increasing substantially energy efficiency.The operation of a special energy poor efficiency comprises known " overshoot " and " undershoot ", wherein for overshoot, although heat supply operation no longer continues, but environment temperature still continues to rise on set point temperatures, but for undershoot, even if after heat supply operation recovers, environment temperature still continues to decline under set point temperatures.This problem is especially obvious in radiant heating system, and usually causes not reaching desirable comfort conditions.Overshoot and undershoot are usually due to the thermal inertia of the enclosure space that is heated or by the quality size of heat supply.The limited efficacy avoiding less desirable overshoot effect and undershoot effect of classical control system.
As being 50-8433 at technology publication number, being discuss in the document of " stealing thermostat (Power Stealing Thermostats) " from the exercise question of Honeywell (1997), early stage thermostat utilizes bimetal strip to carry out sensing temperature and in response to the temperature variation in room.The motion of bimetal strip is used for direct open and close circuit.Whenever closed contact is to provide heating and/or to freeze to controlled space, electric power is transported to electromechanical actuator, is generally the relay in HVAC equipment or contactor.Because these thermostats do not need electric power to operate, therefore connection is very simple.Only a wire is connected to transformer, and another wire is connected to load.Typically, 24V ac power transformer, thermostat exchange HVAC equipment relay and are all connected in the loop with 24V, and wherein each device only has two outsides connections needed.

Fig. 7 shows the circuit diagram 700 of the simplification of the system for managing the electric power that thermostat consumes according to an embodiment.Feed circuit 710 comprise full wave bridge rectifier 720, storage and the level and smooth bridge output capacitor 722 of waveform (such as, it can in the magnitude of 30 microfarads), step down voltage redulator circuit 724, power and battery (power-and-battery, PAB) regulating circuit 728 and rechargeable lithium ion batteries 730.Be combined with other control circuits comprising backboard power management circuitry 727, head unit power management circuitry 729 and microcontroller 708, feed circuit 710 can be configured to and be suitable for having the Characteristic and function hereinafter described.The description of the more details of feed circuit 710 and relevant parts can current disclosed other local and/or at above-mentioned sequence number be 13/467,025 U. S. application in find.
By the configuration shown in Fig. 7, when there is " C " electric wire when mounted, feed circuit 710 as relative high powers, AC-to DC conversion electric power operation that rechargeable battery is auxiliary.When there is not " C " electric wire, feed circuit 710 as stealing, AC-to DC conversion electric power operation that rechargeable battery is auxiliary.The voltage vcc MAIN that feed circuit 710 are generally used for providing the various electronic units of thermostat to use, in one embodiment, this voltage can be about 4.0 volts.For the situation that there is " C " electric wire, do not need accidental saltus step (trip) (because having inactive stealing) or the non-toggle (untrip) (for activity stealing) of worrying HVAC call realy, therefore can suppose that relatively a large amount of electric power can be used.Usually, by the electric power of " C " electric wire supply by large for the instant electrical power at any time more required than residual circuit in thermostat.
But " C " electric wire exists only in the family of about 20% usually.Therefore, when there is not " C " electric wire, feed circuit 710 can also be configured to " stealing " electric power in from other HVAC electric wires.As used in this, " inactive stealing " refer to steal based on electric power from wire during suitable place does not have active call in perform stealing.Therefore, steal the situation from " Y " wire for electric power, " inactive stealing " refers to the stealing performed when not having movable refrigeration call in suitable place.As used in this, " activity stealing " refer to steal based on electric power from wire during there is active call in suitable place in perform stealing.Therefore, steal the situation from " Y " wire for electric power, " activity stealing " refers to the stealing performed when there being movable refrigeration call in suitable place.During inactive stealing or activity stealing, electric power can be stolen from selected available call relay electric wire.Although can find in the application of the common transfer be incorporated herein by reference before the complete description of stealing circuit 710, following brief description is enough for object of the present disclosure.
Some parts in thermostat, such as head unit processing capacity, user interface and/or electronic console can consume instant electrical power more more than the electric power only provided by stealing.When these more crave for the parts active operation of electric power, the electric power supplied by stealing can be supplemented by rechargeable battery 730.In other words, when thermostat is busy with operation, such as, when electronic console is in active display mode, electric power can be supplied by stealing and rechargeable battery 730.In order to retain the electric power be stored in rechargeable battery 730, and give the charging of rechargeable battery 730 chance, the time quantum that some embodiments optimization head unit processing capacity and electronic console operate with active mode.In other words, in some embodiments maybe advantageously, as far as possible for a long time head unit processing capacity remained on park mode or low-power mode and electronic console is remained on passive display mode, and not affecting Consumer's Experience.
When head unit processing capacity and electronic console are in passive mode or park mode, the electric power of thermostat consumption is less than the electric power provided by stealing usually.Therefore, do not may be used for charging to rechargeable battery 730 by the electric power that thermostat consumes.In this embodiment, backboard processing capacity 708 (MSP430) can be configured to monitoring environment sensor in the low power mode, then head unit processing capacity 732 (AM3703) is waken up, to recalculate optimal control policy like that as the described herein when needs control HVAC system.Similarly, backboard processing capacity 708 may be used for monitoring the sensor for detecting ambient temperature, and when determining that striding across maintenance band threshold values and/or desired wakeup time or wake events occurs, it can wake head unit disposal system 732 and/or electronic console up.
State in a different manner, be 13/467 according to the sequence number of above-mentioned common transfer, the instruction of the application of the U. S. application of 025 and other common transfers be incorporated to, thermostat described here represents advanced, many sensings, the intelligence of Microprocessor S3C44B0X or " learning type " thermostat, this thermostat provides processing power, intuitively and the visually user interface of pleasant, network connects, with the abundant combination of energy saving capability (comprising the predictive control algorithm of current description), and do not need from so-called " the C-electric wire " of HVAC system or the line power from family expenses wall outlet simultaneously, although (namely the function of this advanced person is selected compared with " stealing ", the electric power of small amount is extracted from one or more HVAC relay of conversing) instant electrical power that can provide safely may need more instant electrical power.Exemplarily, can consume in the magnitude of 250mW when head unit microprocessor is waken up and processed, can consume in the magnitude of 250mW when LCD module (such as, 560) is movable.And can consume 250mW when Wi-Fi module (such as, 612) is movable, and need to be movable on a consistent basis, described basis is unanimously such as that dutycycle is consistent 2% in usual scene.But in order to avoid being used in the HVAC relay saltus step of a large amount of commercial HVAC system mistakenly, the power supply capacity of stealing circuit is limited to the magnitude of 100mW-200mW usually, this deficiency thinks the electric power needed for the supply of a lot of scene usually.
Thermostat is at least by using rechargeable battery (such as, 544 (or there is the onboard electric storage medium of equivalent capability)) solve this problem, this rechargeable battery during hardware power consumption is less than the time interval of the power consumption that stealing can provide safely in charging, and during hardware power consumption is greater than the time interval of the power consumption that stealing can provide safely in discharge to provide required additional power.In order to promote to reduce power consumption and the mode extending the emphasis battery in the serviceable life of rechargeable battery operates, thermostat is provided with: (i) relatively powerful and relatively power consumption is large first processor (such as, Texas Instruments AM3703 microprocessor), it can perform more complicated function rapidly, such as drive the user interface display of visually pleasant, calculating parameter forecast model, parametric model is applied to the control strategy selected by a group, by cost function minimization to determine optimal control policy, and perform other mathematical studying formulas various calculating, and (ii) relatively not powerful and second processor that power consumption is less (such as, Texas InstrumentsMSP430 microcontroller), for performing lighter task, comprise driving and control take sensor, drive and control temperature sensor.In order to save valuable electric power, the time period that state that first processor maintains " dormancy " extends and only when needing its ability " waking up " it, but, make the second processor more or less be held open (although preferably make some internal clocking slow down or of short duration periodic intervals out of service with conservation of power) constantly to perform the task of its relative low-power.First processor and the second processor configure mutually, make the second processor when there is some event first processor " can be waken " up, some event of described generation such as senses the condition needing to recalculate predictive control strategy, this can be called as " waking up " equipment.As difference in functionality target to be achieved and/or economize on electricity target a part, these wake-up device can be unlocked and be closed.Such as, can ambient temp sensor be set, when the environment temperature or other conditions that need to recalculate predictive control strategy being detected by this ambient temp sensor, second processor " will wake " first processor up, make first processor can perform one or more operation of predictive control algorithm described herein or indicate HVAC system to circulate between opening and closed condition.
Those skilled in the art it is understood that be only exemplary with the various thermostat embodiments described shown by Fig. 3 to Fig. 7, and do not mean that as restrictive.Other hardware a lot of and/software merit rating can be used to the various functions implementing thermostat and describe hereinafter.These embodiments should be regarded as exemplary platform, and in this exemplary platform, following embodiment can be implemented to provide enforceable fully open.Certainly, following methods, system and/or software program product can also utilize different types of thermostat, different hardware and/or different software to implement.
Fig. 8 A shows the step of the calculating for time relative temperature according to embodiment.As used in this, time relative temperature (" T2T ") refers to from current point in time until reach the estimation of the excess time of target temperature.As the described herein, the T2T information dedicated calculated by thermostat is in by the enclosure space of heat supply or refrigeration, or in other words, determined T2T is applicable to this enclosure space.In view of the many factors of the route of the thermal tracking that can affect in the HVAC circulation in the particular real-world world, have been found that method described herein can produce reasonably good estimation.And, in the face of contingent a lot of real world modification (some for predictable and other are uncertain), have been found that for the current description of selectivity display T2T information method (such as, when this T2T time diminishes show " being less than 10 minutes " and if it is in unimaginable or insecure mode " action ", do not show this T2T information) T2T equipment can be utilized to provide the overall user experience of pleasant, which increase the overall attractiveness of thermostat and noticeable degree, make it possible to attract user to pay close attention to its power conservation feature and the ecosystem of emphasis energy further.Significantly, although described example provides under the specific background of heat supply, those skilled in the art easily expect the method for correspondence to be applied to refrigeration background, and therefore these are all in the scope of this instruction.
According to a preferred implementation, the T2T algorithm of thermostat is first by learning phase (step 802) hint, this learning phase occurs very soon after installation or factory reset first, during course of normal operation thus in " significant " or " non-maintenance " heating cycle of the first predetermined number, thermostat starts to build and maintains the database of its T2T relevant information, and this database customizes for specific enclosure space and specific HVAC system.By " non-maintenance " heating cycle, it means has actual set point temperatures change, so heating cycle is able to instantiation.This can compare with " maintenance " heating cycle, and in " maintenance " heating cycle, set point temperatures has kept constant, but HVAC system is activated because temperature reduces and operates until again reach (maintenance) this temperature.In one example, the predetermined number of " study " heating cycle is 10, although this number can change in fact when not departing from the scope of this instruction.For each study circulation, tracking that thermostat automatically (does not need any positive instruction from user or instruction) is relative to temperature variation Δ H (t) of time " t ", and wherein t=0 represents the beginning of heating cycle.
After the study circulation of suitable number (step 804), build enough data automatically to produce the historical models " G " of enclosure space, this historical models " G " is called " totally " model alternatively, provides initial estimation when this model may be used for the beginning calculated at T2T subsequently.Along with the advance of time, it is perfect constantly that overall model can utilize more data point subsequently, this is that it can also be called " historical models estimation " because each heating cycle represents that another " experiment " for this enclosure space is with perfect " overall model estimation ".For a preferred implementation, the time span of overall model can be restricted to only nearest period, such as nearest 30 days to 60 days, makes it more may reflect the impact of the current season of this year.
Fig. 8 B shows the concept map of the method for Fig. 8 A, comprises the figure of overall model G.Have been found that can conveniently calculate, simultaneously for the feature of this overall model is depicted as single parameter straight line (having linear dimensions " c ") between Δ H=0 and Δ H=0.5 DEG C by a reasonably suitable mathematical function, and two parametric lines (there is linear dimensions and second parameter " a " and " b " respectively) exceeding this point then.
Refer again to now Fig. 8 A, in step 808, when current operation set point temperatures is from initial value H
0change to required end value H
ftime, this T2T algorithm is put into use.This set point change by user by using walking rotating disk (walk-up dial) or remote network access equipment calls, or can be able to be encountered when the set point change of the plan of the current operation set point temperatures that changes alternatively.In step 812, only utilize overall model G, by utilizing overall model G as shown in Figure 8 B that H will be worth
f-H
0=Δ H (0) is mapped in T2T (0) and calculates initial estimation T2T (0).This initial estimation (it can be called as overall model initial estimation) can show at once in thermostat display, even shows in real time when the situation user for manual walking set point change rotates rotating disk.
In step 810, this step continues usual on lower a few minutes of heating cycle, by utilizing overall model G to be mapped in TT (t) by the room temperature H (t) when pre-test, overall model is estimated to continue to be used to provide current time relative temperature to estimate TT (t).Overall model T2T estimates at this by TT
gt () represents.Actual room temperature value H (t) can be provided with the periodic intervals of rule by thermostats sense circuit, within such as every 30 seconds, provides.According to preferred implementation, during overall estimation is used to this time period showing object, real-time model R is by following the trail of Δ H (t)=H (t)-H
0currency the time is built.By the present inventor found out that, real-time model R (it is called alternatively " locally " model) is until can be used for the object that T2T estimates when can set up reasonably straight line (from statistically), and this straight line is usually until there has been a certain predetermined rising of setting up by rule of thumb at point 854 place of minimum point 852 in the track of H (t), the such as rising of 0.2 DEG C, just can set up.Have been found that a useful guidance of setting up by rule of thumb be wait for until after 0.2 DEG C of minimum point interval 10 temperature samples of 30 seconds of rising point 854, reasonably suitably estimate until utilize real-time model to calculate.According to a preferred implementation, real-time model R can by utilize in linear projection to target temperature line for set up " real-time model estimation ", as shown in Figure 8 B.Real-time model T2T estimates to pass through TT at this
rt () represents.For an embodiment, this calculating that is used to project of only up-to-date 10 temperature samples (or nearest sample of other suitable number) estimates TT in real time
rthe straight line of (t).In other embodiments, all data points after point 854 may be used to calculate TT
r(t).
If in step 812, determine real-time model and estimate TT
rt () not enough reliable (such as, utilizing the above-mentioned standard of interval 10 points of 30 seconds after point 854), then repeat step 810 until TT
rwhen () is enough reliable t, based on this, perform step 814.In step 814, illustrate at overall model estimation TT
gt () and real-time model estimate TT
rt the conversion between (), makes not have " jump " in the actual value of TT (t), " jump " for viewing display user be frightening, this conversion is summarized as TT (t)=TRANS [TT
g(t) → TT
r(t)].Can realize this conversion in many ways when not departing from the scope of this instruction, but in a preferred embodiment, this conversion performs as the straight line from a curve to another curve is changed, wherein this conversion occurs with the speed being not more than 10 seconds per second.Once complete this conversion, can be used alone real-time estimation (step 816) until circulation terminates.
As shown in Figure 8 A, after the circulation of step 816 terminates, recalculating of overall model can be performed in step 806, make, before the instantiation of next heating cycle, nearest historical data can be utilized.Alternatively, overall model can with every a few circulation primary, other regularly recalculate once a day or with certain.
Preferably, together with step 814 to step 816, be incorporated to several safeguard, " wisdom " is remained in shown T2T estimation.If safeguard indicates the unreliable state or other " wisdom " problems estimated for real-time model, then only close T2T display, and replace as time read, will show simply word heating (HEATING) (etc.).Exemplarily, if the data sample after point 854 is greater than certain threshold values from the statistics skew of straight line, then T2T display is closed.Similarly, if the real-time model of T2T is estimated to start to increase the time period extended, or indicate irrational large numeral, then T2T display is closed.
example predictive control system
As shown in Figure 9, conventional thermostat usually by limit around temperature 902 (being referred to herein as set point temperatures) that is required or setting temperature or maintain the temperature that band 900 controls family.Maintain band 900 usually to limit by defining the upper offset value delta T maintaining band threshold temperature 904 and lower maintenance band threshold temperature 906.The common offset value delta T of this maintenance band 900 is apart from design temperature ± 0.7 degree.Such as, if set point temperatures is 72 ° of degrees Fahrenheits, then upper maintenance is with threshold values 904 will be about 72.7 ° of degrees Fahrenheits (such as, 72+0.7), and lower maintenance band threshold values 906 will be about 71.3 ° of degrees Fahrenheits (such as, 72-0.7).
This common thermostat maintaining band is utilized to control to be called that relay type (bang-bang) controls.Although term Open-closure (ON-OFF) controls sometimes also to be used for describing this control, use term relay type, because it has more descriptive compared with relatively general term ON-OFF at this.For heat supply operation, when environment temperature is reduced under lower maintenance band threshold values 906, these controls will make HVAC system circulation open, and these control to make HVAC system circulation closedown when environment temperature rises on upper maintenance band threshold values 904.For refrigerating operation, vice versa, that is, when environment temperature rises on upper maintenance band threshold values 904, HVAC system is circulated and open, and when environment temperature drops under lower maintenance band threshold values 906, HVAC system circulation is closed.Such as, relay-type cortrol is used for heat supply operation and 72 ° of above-mentioned degrees Fahrenheit set points, when environment temperature drops under 71.3 °, this thermostat is opened making the well heater circulation of HVAC system, and well heater circulation will be made to close when temperature rises on 72.7 °.
Relay-type cortrol is the property responded (reactive) in itself, and this opens and closes because they only just make HVAC system circulate when environment temperature band strides across limited threshold values (that is, upper maintenance band and lower maintenance band).In addition, these control not consider the thermal mass in enclosure space and thermal inertia, and as the described herein, this can cause obvious overshoot and/or undershoot.As used in this, the temperature that term " thermal inertia " refers to material or main body becomes equal speed with environment temperature.Thermal inertia is massive material characteristic, and it is relevant with volumetric heat capacity amount to the heat conductivity of material and usually depend on its absorptivity, specific heat, heat conductivity, size etc.
As used in this, term " system inertia " (relevant to thermal inertia) environment temperature real response of referring to family's (or other enclosure spaces) in more general meaning is for the speed of the heat supply of this family (or other enclosure spaces) or the startup of refrigeration cycle.The feature that system inertia can consider heat supply or refrigeration plant itself and the mode transmitted heat in family.Therefore, exemplarily, if the radiant heating system that particular home has is lower powered or weak, then this particular home can show relatively large system inertia (heating up slowly), if but this radiant heating system is replaced by radiant heating system much bigger by force, then this same family can show much smaller system inertia (heating up fast).When family and its HVAC system are considered as control system, in this control system, be input as the On/Off state of HVAC system, export the environment temperature for occupant experiences, then system inertia can be regarded as static state for the model of this control system or quasistatic element.
The example of the impact of relatively high system inertia is obvious in for a lot of radiant heating systems of family, floor wherein in family is heated usually, and surrounding air is by being heated from the radiation on floor after heating and convection current, wherein radiation is generally the dominant pattern of heat trnasfer.The heating of surrounding air may be carried out usually quite lentamente, this be due to usually spend the plenty of time to make floor intensification itself and from floor to air in radiation heat transmission form also spended time.The heat radiation continued causes the rising of the constant temperature of family or set point temperatures of " overshoot ", and sometimes far above design temperature, this can make occupant uncomfortable.When owing to giving before surrounding air heat supply and must heated in floor, therefore when again performing heat supply, similar impact is obvious.Although just at heating floor, the thermal inertia of floor or family is causing the temperature on floor temporarily to decline or " undershoot " set point temperatures, and this can cause uncomfortable equally.
Embodiments of the present invention comprise for the PREDICTIVE CONTROL of domestic heat and/or refrigeration or Model Predictive Control.These control to be different from conventional relay-type cortrol, and in conventional relay-type cortrol, heat supply or refrigerating operation are only when temperature rises or perform when dropping to outside limited maintenance band window.Utilize PREDICTIVE CONTROL, even around temperature in temperature band window (that is, environment temperature also do not stride across maintain band threshold values) or even around temperature also do not enter maintain band window time, heat supply or refrigerating operation just can no longer continue or start to carry out.
Method and system described here is usually for HVAC system, the feature of described HVAC system is relatively high system inertia, such as a lot of radiant heating system, although these method and systems may be used for showing the system of the other types based on temporary transient, seasonal or lasting behavior or symptom with high system inertia equally.Similarly, although method and system described here is mainly for radiant heating system, method and system described here can be applied to heat supply or the refrigeration system of radiation refrigeration system or other types equivalently.Therefore, although use term " radiation heat ", " radiating system " etc. in the following description in order to the object of clear description, be understandable that, the scope of this instruction is not limited thereto.
Embodiment there is provided a kind of Intelligent Radiation heat supply control model for family's HVAC system according to some, it is performed by the thermostat of intelligence, many sensings.When having established Intelligent Radiation heat control to be called due to automatic sensing-detecting and/or clear and definite user input (Figure 22 seen below and relevant automatic " system matches " are discussed), the thermostat of heating form controls to carry out according to predictive control algorithm, predictive control algorithm is called advisably according to the availability of the parameter for predetermined domestic heating system model, in this predetermined domestic heating system model, set up enough degree of confidence.For an embodiment, for system model parameter only based on from employ radiant heating system history heating cycle collect data.For other embodiments, other factors, such as, moment of one day, external temperature, wind condition, solar-heating angle, house and window relative to the sun towards, and/or other relevant informations various, may be used for determining parameter.Experience in order to ensure occupant that is level and smooth, consistent, pleasant, predictive control algorithm only when having set up enough degree of confidence in domestic heating system model, or is called when the degree of confidence enough due to nearest abnormality or partly unusual measurement event regains after losing.By abnormality or partly unusual event, this means that the data for calculating heating system model there occurs something, this causes destroying model confidence index, such as stay in the winter time the door opened or window for a long time, data loss event, power cut, uncommon meteorological condition etc.
When not operating in PREDICTIVE CONTROL pattern, Intelligent Radiation control algolithm operates according to the revision of relay-type cortrol pattern, and this revision is designed in fact more keep forging ahead to the reduction of overshoot.More specifically, the overshoot reduction method of keeping forging ahead comprises relay-type cortrol environment temperature in the specific maintenance band of current set point temperature, referred to here as " overshoot of keeping forging ahead reduces maintenance band ", upper maintenance band temperature wherein and lower maintenance band temperature are all positioned under current set point temperature.Therefore, although the thermostat relay type temperature of the routine of set point temperatures " T " controls the symmetrical temperature band of (the T-Δ T) to (T+ Δ T) that can maintain around set point temperatures T, although and the overshoot of gentleness reduction relay type temperature controls to maintain (T-Δ T1) asymmetrical temp band to (T+ Δ T2) (wherein Δ T1> Δ T2>0), but the asymmetric skew that the overshoot reduction method of keeping forging ahead of current description comprises relay-type cortrol to (T-Δ T3) to (T-Δ T4) (wherein Δ T3> Δ T4>0) maintains in band.By means of only example but not by restriction, for the typical set point temperature of 72 °F, the value of Δ T3 and Δ T4 can be respectively 1.0 °F and 0.5 °F.
When not yet setting up (or losing) enough degree of confidence in system model, the overshoot of keeping forging ahead is reduced relay-type cortrol as " retrogressing ", because have been found that PREDICTIVE CONTROL provides compared with using traditional relay-type cortrol more favorably Consumer's Experience.But, the scope of preferred implementation is not limited thereto, in other embodiments, should " retrogressings " can for use around set point temperatures symmetry or leniently asymmetric relay-type cortrol maintain and be with.
For a preferred implementation, have been found that around PREDICTIVE CONTROL and nonanticipating or " retrogressing " control method called that to introduce a kind of " delayed " be effective especially.Exemplarily, if with the operation of nonanticipating pattern, then need the model parameter degree of confidence setting up at least continuous two days before calling PREDICTIVE CONTROL pattern.Similarly, if with the operation of PREDICTIVE CONTROL pattern, then need the non-degree of confidence of model parameter setting up at least continuous two days before calling nonanticipating control model.Advantageously, this " delayed " that call around the selectivity of PREDICTIVE CONTROL pattern further increases the continuity of the experience of home occupants's impression.
Present description is according to the operation of the hot algorithm of Intelligent Radiation in PREDICTIVE CONTROL pattern of some embodiments.In order to implement PREDICTIVE CONTROL, system can be configured to perform " predictive control algorithm ".Such as, the disposal system of thermostat can be accessed and be had predictive control algorithm storer stored therein and can to perform in the process, calculating etc. described hereinafter one or more.In one embodiment, the some or all of processors by the relatively high power consumption of head unit in these process, calculating etc. perform, and this processor is in activity or wake operation pattern.In another embodiment, the some or all of backboard processors by relative low-power consumption in these process, calculating etc. perform.In other embodiments, one or more in these process, calculating etc. share between head unit processor and backboard processor, and/or information is shared between both.Various embodiment for convenience of description, description will mainly for predictive control algorithm.
In some embodiments, predictive control algorithm can determine that whether PREDICTIVE CONTROL feature is suitable for the thermostat system of family.Such as, predictive control algorithm can determine whether to there occurs undershoot or overshoot, and/or the size of the amount occurred.In some radiant heating situations, when heating cycle starts, environment temperature can start to rise fast, and environment temperature can decline rapidly when thermal cycle stops.If undershoot and/or overshoot are not very large problem, then predictive control algorithm can be determined not need PREDICTIVE CONTROL feature described here.In this embodiment, predictive control algorithm even can determine whether PREDICTIVE CONTROL is necessary and correspondingly " On/Off " of adjustment thermostat is arranged.
Be understandable that, although hereafter set forth the system model that comprises " time lag (Lag) " parameter to represent that the feature of radiant heating system can for based on the special mode of one of fiduciary level of being collected history radiant heating performance data by intelligent thermostat, any one in the multiple different model method of any one in any one and the multiple model parameter had in multiple different complexity can be used when not departing from the scope of this instruction.Such as, although a kind of following " mixing " therebetween of " Lag " Parametric Representation described hereinafter: (i) represents static state or the quasistatic parameter of the system inertia of family and HVAC system thereof, (ii) dynamic, according to the time, and/or according to the parameter of condition, it can depend on various factors, the such as moment of one day, season, external temperature, influenced by solar etc., but, utilize multiple or different parameters by domestic heating system modelling, (a) is caught and maintains static state or the quasi-static characteristics of enclosure space/HVAC system, and (b) represents dynamically multiple, according to the time, and/or caught individually according to multiple dynamic parameters of the parameter of condition, maintain, with the appropriate combination for time and condition, certainly also in the scope of this instruction.
In order to determine whether to need PREDICTIVE CONTROL, predictive control algorithm can calculate or measure the inertia of enclosure space or system.The inertia of measuring system is commonly referred to as dynamic one, two or more feature constants of catching and representing residence.These constants can utilize system identification technique to identify, such as system identification technique described herein.In one embodiment, predictive control algorithm can calculate or measure " Lag " of enclosure space.Term " Lag " to refer to after heat supply by the temperature rising limited amount of enclosure space (such as, 0.5 ° of degrees Fahrenheit, 3 ° of degrees Fahrenheits, 5 ° of degrees Fahrenheits etc.) required for time, and be the simple expression of the thermal inertia that to consider enclosure space at least in part, although it also have some dynamically/according to the composition of condition.In some embodiments, unless HVAC system has closed limiting time section (such as, 60 seconds), otherwise Lag measurement can not be calculated, to guarantee not having delayed heat to retain within the enclosed space from heating cycle above.Similarly, before Lag measurement is recorded, HVAC system may be needed to be held open the schedule time, such as, until the environment temperature rising limited amount of enclosure space (such as, 5 ° of degrees Fahrenheits).If HVAC system stopped circulation before the environment temperature of enclosure space rises this amount, then Lag measures and can be dropped.
Can also whole day measure with the several Lag of delimiting period record, may due to environmental factor to allow predictive control algorithm to consider, such as, under being exposed to the sun, rain, temperature that cloudy condition etc. causes rises or declines.According to an embodiment, within one day, the equal time period can be divided into (such as, increased progressively with 6 hours), these time periods represent dawn before the period (such as, when the morning 12 to the morning 6 time), the period in the morning (such as, when the morning 6 to afternoon 12 time), afternoon hours (such as, afternoon 12 time to afternoon 6 time) and the period in the evening (such as, afternoon 6 time to the morning 12 time).Lag measures and can be recorded during each time period in these time periods, and in some embodiments, can from the average Lag value of the Lag survey calculation of various time period.Average Lag value may be used for implementing forecast Control Algorithm described here.According to another embodiment, average Lag value can be determined for each time period.Forecast Control Algorithm described in this time period special Lag value may be used for implementing subsequently is to obtain the more accurate approximate value of radiant heating effect.
Such as, the Lag value of can be greater than the Lag value of the period in the evening significantly the period in the morning.In some embodiments, even if PREDICTIVE CONTROL feature failure, also Lag measurement can be carried out.Correspondingly, once user enables PREDICTIVE CONTROL feature, just can be used to average Lag value.In other embodiments, such as, when thermostat is newly installed, before can utilizing PREDICTIVE CONTROL feature, system cloud gray model limiting time section (such as, a week) may be needed, to allow to measure and record Lag value and calculating mean value.
Along with system call interception supplies thermal characteristics to the specific of enclosure space, average Lag value can modify, adjust and/or upgrade with the limiting time cycle.Such as, this system can be measured constantly and record Lag value and amendment or adjust average Lag value with more approx to enclosure space modeling.This process can be carried out monthly, weekly, every night etc.Can the Lag value measured recently of weighting, make them affect average Lag value more.In like fashion, Lag value can mate the conditions present of enclosure space approx.
Referring now to Figure 10, predicated response in the temperature that radiant heating operates time, predictive control algorithm can assess one group of candidate's control strategy (hereinafter referred to as control strategy), and described control strategy may be used for controlling radiant heating system (see Figure 17-Figure 19).Each control strategy can comprise and limits the multiple binary value time step t when HVAC system circulation is opened and circulation is closed
1-t
n(that is, 1 or 0) (hereinafter referred to as time step or control interval).Time step t
1-t
ncan have the time interval or duration time interval, it is about 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes etc. in some embodiments, although the duration of 10 minutes can for preferably to wake up with minimum noise and/or head unit.
Binary value control strategy can have whole opening time number percent, its refer to HVAC system " predetermined control duration " or for control strategy total duration (hereinafter referred to as the control strategy duration) period circulation open percentage of time.Such as, if the control strategy duration is about 1 hour, HVAC system circulation is opened and is continued 30 minutes, then whole opening time number percent is about 1/2.The control strategy duration can be about 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours etc., although the duration of 1 hour can for preferably to wake up with minimum noise and/or head unit.As hereinafter specifically described, the opening time circulation that each control strategy has minimal number can be limited, this achieve the whole opening time number percent of candidate (such as, 1 opening time circulation is for 1/6 opening time number percent, 2 opening time circulations are for 1/3 opening time number percent, 3 opening times circulate for 1/2 opening time number percent, by that analogy).Control strategy can also limit " control track " or environment temperature track 1004-1010, its refer to the environment temperature of enclosure space due to limit respectively control strategy heat supply operation prediction locus.
Based on the average Lag value determined, simple temperature prediction 1000 can be that HVAC system calculates based on each control strategy.Such as, for each time step of one or more control strategy, simple temperature prediction can be calculated.Then control or environment temperature track 1004-1010 can determine based on the predicted temperature of each control strategy.In view of the environment temperature track 1004-1010 of each control strategy can be assessed or process to predetermined valuation functions (hereinafter referred to as cost function), to select optimal control policy.This optimal control policy according to one or more predetermined estimation Standard Selection, such as, can minimize value at cost as described below.Minimize value at cost can consist essentially of and determine which environment temperature track 1004-1010 has apart from the minimum total change V of set point temperatures ST.
Value at cost can based on each time step t of set point temperatures or target temperature ST and given control strategy
1-t
npredicted temperature between mathematic interpolation.According to some embodiments, the value at cost of control strategy can be each time step t
1-t
nplace target temperature deduct predicted temperature square summation, as follows:
As mentioned below, can be calculated for the cost function of multiple control strategy and the control strategy with minimum value can be selected as most suitable control strategy for this enclosure space heat supply.State in a different manner, cost function can be minimized to determine pending most suitable heat supply operation.In some embodiments, cost function can be weighted, make calculated value at cost more serious by the impact of the temperature prediction of future time step-length, the temperature prediction of described future time step-length more possibly closer to or further from set point temperatures or target temperature ST, and therefore more may estimate overshoot or undershoot.Such as, the difference between the target temperature ST and predicted temperature at time step k place can be multiplied by for the weighting factor (Wt (k)) changed between zero and one of time step k.Therefore, have and will have larger cost compared with the control strategy of future temperature of general objective and predicted temperature change V and comparatively can not be selected.
For given control strategy, minimized cost function can be similar to overshoot and the undershoot generation of minimum, and this is because overshoot and undershoot are reflected in by the difference in predicted temperature and target temperature ST in cost equation.As mentioned above, future time step-length t
1-t
nmore may represent overshoot or undershoot, and can be weighted appropriately to affect cost function.In some embodiments, such as when system do not have for family enough for dsc data or Lag value very short (such as, being less than 10 minutes or 20 minutes) time, can be caused by cost function minimization PREDICTIVE CONTROL should by the prediction used.In this embodiment, system can switch to conventional relay-type cortrol, and can use conventional maintenance band and off-set value (such as, ± 0.7 °).
forecast model
In order to predict the temperature of each time step strong point foregoing, the parameterized model (hereinafter referred to as forecast model) to each time step predicted temperature change dT (i) can be used.This forecast model can based on the history environment temperature of the enclosure space obtained by thermostat during starting the relevant history cycle of radiation heat control.This historical data can be stored in the various memory devices comprising inside and outside (such as, cloud) device or service and be set up.Such as, in one embodiment, forecast model, based on the regretional analysis of one or more independent variable, utilizes temperature variation dT (i) for dependent variable.In a specific embodiment, regretional analysis can use two independent variables (such as, radiation heat and solar radiation), although in other embodiments, 3 or more independent variables (such as, external temperature, humidity etc.) can be used.Below example predictive models is shown:
dT(i)＝a0+a1*SR(i)+a2*∑(Activation(k)*u
_heat(i-k))
In superincumbent equation, a
0, a
1and a
2for the regression coefficient obtained by the least square fitting of historical figures data point, this calculating can be carried out with the interval of repeating, such as monthly, weekly, every day (such as, midnight) etc.Except other things, data point can comprise the hot u_heat etc. of temperature T, temperature variation dT, application, and it can be in delimiting period in each time step (such as 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month etc. in) is recorded.The least square fitting of these historical data points can be obtained to determine regression coefficient (that is, a
0, a
1and a
2).In some embodiments, historical data and least square fitting calculate can be configured to larger weight or consider to obtain recently data point (such as, upper one week or a few days ago in the data point of acquisition).As hereinafter specifically described, forecast model comprises predetermined responding trajectory (hereinafter referred to as function), such as solar radiation SR (i), run function Activation (k) and heat input response u_heat.These functions are by regression coefficient weighting, and described regression coefficient is by calculating historical data model of fit.Regression coefficient can increase along with the measurement importance of respective function and increase, or reduces along with the measurement importance reduction of respective function.
According to above forecast model, regression coefficient a0 represents constant, it typically is negative value, and to illustrate when not having heat supply factor (such as, solar radiation SR and radiant heating), temperature variation dT is by for negative.State in a different manner, negative regression coefficient a0 ensure that, according to expectation such, and when not having thermal source, the temperature T of estimation will decline.SR (i) is expressed as follows the function being similar to or considering solar irradiance described by literary composition.Activation (k) represents the function of weighting or consideration radiant heating input (u_heat) above in the change of prediction Current Temperatures.According to this model, radiant heating input (u_heat (i_Lag)) above has maximum effect to temperature variation dT (i) usually.In some embodiments, current heat supply input u_heat (i) and input u_heat of heat supply the earliest (i-2*Lag) may have less impact to temperature variation dT (i), although if these inputs are confirmed as more important, can adjust this model.K is the time span of run function, and as with described in drag, the scope of this time span can from 1 to 2*Lag, or this time span can change according to used model.It is level and smooth that Activation (k) makes well heater input (u_heat), and be delayed its impact, this can simulate thermal mass or the thermal inertia of enclosure space simultaneously.According to above temperature variation equation dT (i), can determine according to following equation at the temperature T of any given time step strong point.
T(i+1)＝T(i)+dT(i)
In this equation, T (i) is the temperature at time step i place.DT (i) is the temperature variation of the prediction at step-length i place at any time.T (i+1) is the predicted temperature at future time step-length place, and the temperature that it equals time step i place adds temperature variation dT (i).According to an embodiment, the time step duration (such as, i, i+1 etc.) can be about 10 minutes.Determine 10 minutes step intervals and reduced noise in calculating, decreased electricity needs and computation requirement simultaneously and allow head unit to keep dormancy.
Solar radiation can be modeled as curve as shown in figure 11.Solar radiation can be modeled to predict that solar radiation to what extent have impact on the environment temperature of enclosure space.Such as, between during 0-6 hour (during such as midnight to the morning 6), the impact of the modelling of solar radiation is 0 not yet to rise to show the sun, and therefore, enclosure space is not yet subject to the impact of solar radiation.Between during 6-18 hour, this model rises to 1 from 0 and gets back to 0 again, thus show along with the sun is advanced overhead, solar radiation becomes more by force on enclosure space and then more weak (solar radiation 1 represents full solar radiation), this prediction can cause the rising of environment temperature.Between during 18-24 hour, modeled impact is 0 to show the sun and land again.
As shown in solar radiation model, curve sharply rises and declines, and towards middle possibly tapered, and it to have implied during radiation effect by day (such as, before the morning 10 time) can experience rapidly, and almost can experience in whole daytime.The shape of solar radiation model can by the position adjusted to represent family more all sidedly.Such as, model curve can have different shapes or be the crooked relatively strong influenced by solar to show morning or evening.Solar radiation hour can location-based longitude or latitude etc. and extend.In one embodiment, the temperature of enclosure space rises and can be monitored by whole day and measure to set up and/or adjustment solar radiation model, and makes this model be suitable for specific enclosure space thus.In like fashion, solar radiation model can be unique to specific enclosure space and/or position, to consider to affect the tree, view etc. around family or buildings of solar radiation temperature.Whether whether solar radiation model according to current environmental condition or the time in 1 year, such as, can also exist obnubilation and covers, raining or snowing, or whether heat supply operation occurs in autumn or winter.In other embodiments, influenced by solar can be modeled to has other shapes, comprises triangle etc.
Similarly, above-mentioned run function can be modeled to show and be convenient to the impact of the radiation heater input calculated before or after given time step.Such as, as shown in figure 12, run function can be modeled as triangle, thus shows the temperature elevating effect caused by the operation of radiation heater.In other embodiments, run function can be modeled as other shapes various, comprises curve, para-curve, Gaussian distribution etc.These extra shapes can depend on the position etc. of be specifically heated enclosure space, enclosure space, and more accurately can catch thermal mass or the inertia effect of enclosure space.
In some embodiments, modeled run function can comprise up to twice Lag value scope with consider after radiant heating no longer continues occur residual heating effect.Such as, the model of Figure 12 is used for a kind of system, and this system has the time step of Lag and 10 minute to 20 minutes (the model illustrating the interval of 20 minutes) of about 60 minutes.To the model illustrate when radiant heating starts (that is, time=0 or k=0), do not experience radiant heating effect (that is, startup is 0).After 60 minutes, (that is, k=60) experiences the complete effect (that is, startup is 1) of radiant heating, and this is because the time equals Lag value.The time period (that is, 60 minutes to 120 minutes) of being longer than 60 minutes represents the residual effect of the radiant heating occurred due to system inertia.K is turned back to 0 by the startup length (that is, k=120) of 120 minutes, radiant heating does not occur because predict at this place.Figure 13 shows chart, the graphs illustrates the modelling effect of heated condition relative to radiation heater state of the delay Lag of the run function based on Figure 12, Figure 13 show even closedown radiation heater after heating effect still continue to be felt.
In fact, the summing function more than illustrated is the convolution of well heater input signal and run function model, and it predicts the impact of the radiant heating in any given time step strong point.In fact summing function can be simple ARMA model, and it does not need the radiation heat data before calculating or storage in a large number, and not so it may need a large amount of calculating and/or electricity needs, and this is unavailable in the thermostat of limited power.In fact radiation heat input before can be carried out convolution algorithm and obtain single value by Lag value, and this makes summing function be easier to management to calculate and to reduce electricity needs.
As previously mentioned, Boot Model depends on the Lag for the enclosure space that is heated as above calculates, and therefore, Lag value is be only exemplary in 60 minutes, and usually changes according to the feature of other enclosure space that is heated.Equally, as mentioned above, Lag value can change according to moment of one day or other environmental baselines one or more or enclosure space condition.Therefore, run function can specifically for moment of one day or other environmental baselines one or more or enclosure space condition.Similarly, run function does not need for triangular shaped, and can comprise other shapes various approximate preferably that can provide enclosure space.
Figure 14 represents above-mentioned equation with control system form.As shown in figure 14, in some embodiments, above-mentioned equation can comprise ternary (Tout), and this ternary represents the impact of external temperature, such as due to the heat trnasfer by wall, it can be similar to mode described herein by extra regression coefficient weighting.Can be it is understood to one skilled in the art that, by least square fitting obtain regression coefficient (such as, a0, a1, a2 etc.) with the heating effect on the concrete enclosure space of approximate description.Such as, if the insulation of enclosure space is good, then the corresponding coefficient for solar radiation and/or external temperature can be little, thus the thermal distortion showing enclosure space is mainly due to radiant heating.If determine that solar radiation or the temperature of external temperature on enclosure space have to affect more greatly or more significantly, then can produce similar result.Above-mentioned equation allows PREDICTIVE CONTROL to be adjusted to the concrete enclosure space that is heated.Although not shown, this model can comprise its dependent variable, considering humidity, rain, snow, height above sea level etc., each variable wherein can carry out weighting according to the importance of variable.Enclosure space can also be averaged to the temperature reading from the various sensors being positioned at enclosure space.Such as, radiation heat is usually from flooring radiation.Therefore, floor sensor can in order to determine when floor close to set point temperatures to be opened and closed by thermostat.
Figure 15 shows the temperature variation utilized in above-mentioned forecast model equation calculating enclosure space.1502 represent that the temperature in enclosure space swings, and 1504 represent the radiation heat applied, and 1506 expressions postpone or time lag compensation heat, it is the heat of application and the convolution of run function.1508 represent solar radiation heat affecting.
As previously described, forecast model can in cycle basis (such as each midnight) and historical figures data point " matching " to obtain regression coefficient a0, a1, a2 etc.Can also calculate " goodness of fit " for forecast model, it represents that this model to what extent illustrates the temperature variation of enclosure space.The goodness of fit changes usually between zero and one, the more close matching of numerical value larger expression model and historical data.In some embodiments, only in the goodness of fit on certain minimum threshold values time (such as, on 0.5), just can usage forecastings model.If the goodness of fit is under this minimum threshold values, then system can default to conventional relay-type cortrol.Extra verification can be performed to forecast model and historical data point.Such as, the symbol (that is, ±) of the coefficient of solar radiation can be verified to guarantee that this symbol is that just it has implied that the temperature due to solar radiation rises.If this symbol is negative, its hint declines due to the temperature of influenced by solar, then can refuse this model.In some embodiments, the exceptional value data point of historical data also can be detected and refuse.
Figure 16 shows the histogram of the matching calculated for about 600 thermostat apparatus in two months periods (Dec and January).Thermostat was with the time lag operate heater of 30 minutes or larger and consider the continuous data at least two weeks.As shown in histogram, the device considered of 75% achieves the minimum threshold values of 0.5, and this shows that the PREDICTIVE CONTROL described by utilization improves heat supply operation.In other embodiments, the goodness of fit can be used as mentioned below determine the width maintaining band.
Above-mentioned equation is by more complicated PREDICTIVE CONTROL equation, and such as ARMA (auto regressive moving average) equation, being simplified to can the equation of easily sequencing on the thermostat apparatus that electric power is limited.It also greatly reduces the calculating electric power carried out needed for temperature variation prediction.In addition, Lag factor decreases by hot input effect is before combined into single variable the sum must considering the input carrying out temperature variation prediction, otherwise needs to calculate individually.
control algolithm
Control algolithm utilizes above-mentioned forecast model to predict the temperature in each time step strong point.Control algolithm also determines control strategy based on minimizing of cost function as described above.In essence, control algolithm calculates time quantum that the time quantum that is held open of HVAC system and head unit wake up to reevaluate its mode of operation or condition.By the time step of limited amount or control interval (such as, 6 time steps on 60 minutes) on repeatedly run forecast model, can control strategy be selected, overshoot and/or undershoot are minimized by it, the change of HVAC state be remained to minimum simultaneously.When each head unit wakes up, the control strategy selected by enforcement and repeat this process, to reevaluate control strategy.Therefore, even if made incorrect prediction, and have selected goodish control strategy, system also can reevaluate its situation and correct control strategy when it wakes up, this can due to desired wakeup time, strides across and maintains band, the startup of proximity transducer or some other reasonses.
In some embodiments, the number of the control strategy of calculating or prediction can be reduced to the subset (that is, one group of candidate's control strategy) of restriction.The subset of the restriction of the control strategy considered can also be under lower maintenance band threshold values, be on upper maintenance band threshold values or in maintenance band according to environment temperature.The number of times that the circulation of radiation heater is opened and circulation is closed can minimize by the subset of the restriction of control strategy, and this is preferred when using radiant heating system.Particularly, the subset of the restriction of control strategy can be selected, make only a single state or transition to occur in the given sequence of well heater control action, or make radiant heating system can not circulate unlatching more than twice within the given control duration.How soon can also restrict from a status transition to another state for the state of well heater.Such as, in one embodiment, can require that well heater is held open or cuts out 20 minutes or more to reduce On/Off circulation transition.How soon transition is made between On/Off state restriction the subset of the restriction of control strategy can be reduced further as described below based on for system.The calculating of needs minimizes by the subset of the restriction of control strategy further, and the computation requirement therefore reduced control system and/or electricity needs.
Figure 17 shows the subset (that is, one group of candidate's control strategy) of the restriction of the admissible control strategy when environment temperature is lower maintenance under band threshold values.Particularly, Figure 17 shows admissible 6 control strategies, although can consider more or less control strategy in other embodiments.Control strategy is binary value, means and is input as 1 or 0, wherein inputs 1 and represents that the HVAC opening time circulates, and inputs for 0 expression HVAC shut-in time and circulate.Therefore, the first control strategy considers in very first time step-length that (that is, the single well heater opening time circulation at i) place, then has 5 continuous print shut-in times circulations.First control strategy has the whole opening time number percent of about 1/6.Comparatively speaking, the 6th control strategy consider six continuous time step-length (that is, time step i to i+5) place the circulation of six continuous print well heater opening times, for the whole opening time number percent of about 1.Relative to control strategy above, each the single additional heaters opening time considered for extra time step in control strategy (that is, 2-5) between circulates.As mentioned above, the time period that time step can limit for certain, such as 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes etc.
According to an embodiment, the subset of the restriction of control strategy can also based on about well heater can how soon the restriction of transition between opening time circulation and shut-in time circulation restriction and reduce further.Such as, if time step is defined as 10 minutes, and restriction well heater maintains the previous cycle of at least 20 minutes, then can not consider the first control strategy in cost minimisation function, unless well heater is opened.
Cost function as above (it can comprise or can not comprise weight factor) can be minimized to determine most suitable control strategy to be used.Based on selected control strategy, determine front heater state (namely, opening time circulation or shut-in time circulation), and based on the time step duration and until expection status transition needed for the number of time step determine the wakeup time of head unit.Such as, if have selected the 3rd control strategy based on minimizing of cost function, then well heater is by transition or be held open and determine that wakeup time is about 30 minutes (that is, 10 minute duration of 3 each time steps of time step *) for the time step duration of 10 minutes.When system is waken up after the duration of expecting, this system will reevaluate its situation, to determine whether to need additional heat.If this system is because any reason is waken up before the desired duration, then this system will reevaluate its situation equally.
In some embodiments, whenever system maintain band outside time, this system just can automatically be held open.Such as, as shown in figure 17, for each control strategy, always the well heater input 1 at time i place, as long as this means that environment temperature is under lower maintenance band threshold values, well heater just will be held open.But when environment temperature strides across lower maintenance band threshold values, selected control strategy can change, this allows well heater input circulation to close.When environment temperature is reduced under lower maintenance band threshold values, the subset of the restriction of above-mentioned control strategy again can be considered.
Similarly, when environment temperature strides across upper maintenance band threshold values, even if not yet arrive desired wakeup time, system also can be closed by automatic cycle.Such as, if it is inaccurate that predicted temperature rises, and temperature rising is greater than expection, and environment temperature is risen to and maintains on band threshold values, then this system will be waken up and close well heater to prevent the further heat supply of enclosure space.In like fashion, conventional relay-type cortrol can act as control for subsequent use to guarantee too small or excessive heat supply can not occur.
Figure 18 shows the subset of the restriction of the admissible control strategy when environment temperature is upper maintenance on band threshold values.As shown in figure 18, the first control strategy considers and circulates in the well heater shut-in time at six continuous print time steps (that is, time step i to i+5) place, for for 0 whole opening time number percent.Comparatively speaking, the 6th control strategy considers in very first time step-length that (that is, the single well heater shut-in time circulation at i) place, then has five continuous print well heater opening times circulations, for the whole opening time number percent of about 5/6.Relative to control strategy above, each the extra well heater opening time considered for step-length generation extra time in control strategy (that is, 2-5) between circulates.As previously described, when regulation circulation On/Off be constrained to make to avoid after circulation transition before, make well heater circulation On/Off time, limited control strategy can be limited further.
As mentioned above, cost function can be minimized to determine most suitable control strategy and can determine front heater state (that is, open or close) and wakeup time.When system wake-up, system will reevaluate its situation, open to determine whether well heater should be transitioned into or will be held open.In some embodiments, whenever system is when maintaining band and being outside, system just can automatically keep closing.Such as, as shown in figure 18, the well heater input at time i place is always 0, as long as this means that environment temperature is on upper maintenance band threshold values, maintenance is just closed by well heater.But when environment temperature strides across upper maintenance band threshold values, control strategy can change to allow well heater to input circulation and open.When environment temperature rises on upper maintenance band threshold values, the subset of the restriction of above-mentioned control strategy again can be considered.Similarly, when striding across lower maintenance band threshold values, even if arrive the wakeup time of expecting, this system also can automatically circulate unlatching.As mentioned above, when predicted temperature reduction is inaccurate and temperature reduction is greater than expection, this may be useful.
Due in some embodiments, until stride across lower maintenance band threshold values, well heater function just can circulate closedown, similarly, maintain band threshold values until stride across, well heater function just can circulate unlatching, therefore should be understood that, in these embodiments, can expect that widening this maintenance band (that is, increase maintains band off-set value) opens and circulation closedown to allow well heater to circulate more rapidly.Therefore, in some embodiments, how to illustrate the temperature variation of enclosure space well based on above-described forecast model, can increase to maintain to be with the value of threshold values and to widen to maintain and be with.Such as, maintaining band threshold values can based on the goodness of fit calculated for forecast model.When the goodness of fit is relatively high, when showing that forecast model best show temperature variation, can widen to maintain band and increase to maintain and be with threshold values.Similarly, when the goodness of fit is relatively low, when showing more inconsistent between forecast model and temperature variation, maintenance band can be made to narrow and reduce to maintain band threshold values.
In one embodiment, when the goodness of fit is on 0.7, maintains band threshold values and can be set in apart from set point temperatures ± 1.5 ° degrees Fahrenheit.When the goodness of fit is between 0.5 and 0.7, maintains band threshold values and can be set in apart from set point temperatures ± 1.0 ° degrees Fahrenheit.When the goodness of fit is between 0.3 and 0.5, maintain band threshold values and can be set in apart from set point temperatures ± 0.7 ° degrees Fahrenheit, it represents the conventional normally used threshold values of relay-type cortrol.If the goodness of fit is lower than 0.3, then system can be determined should not control by usage forecastings, and can use conventional relay-type cortrol.
Figure 19 shows the subset when environment temperature restriction of admissible control strategy when maintaining in band.Control strategy shown in Figure 19 can be the combination of the control strategy that Figure 17 and Figure 18 describes in essence.But the control strategy of Figure 19 allows when not striding across temperature threshold, well heater can circulate and open or circulation cut out.Such as, if environment temperature is in maintenance band, then thermostat can determine a kind of strategy, (namely this strategy comprises some heating loads, strategy 2-5 and 8-12), whole heating cycle (namely, strategy 7) or without heating load (that is, strategy 1), and be not limited to opening time circulation or shut-in time circulation until stride across threshold temperature.In addition, thermostat can be determined first to apply heat supply (that is, tactful 7-12) in the control duration, or after-applied heat supply (that is, tactful 1-6) in the control duration.As described above, when regulation circulation On/Off be constrained to make to avoid heater after closedown transition before time, limited control strategy can be limited further.
As mentioned above, cost function can be minimized to determine most suitable control strategy and can determine front heater state (that is, open or close) and wakeup time.When system wake-up, system will reevaluate its situation, open or will close to determine whether well heater should be transitioned into or keep current state.
In some embodiments, system can also determine which controls option and is suitable for domestic heat most.Such as, this system can assess relay-type cortrol described here or PREDICTIVE CONTROL more may provide required result.
As described above, a part for aforesaid operations or operations all substantially, can perform on head unit processor or backboard processor.In some embodiments, predicted temperature calculating, cost function minimization etc. can be performed by head unit processor, because this processor is usually more powerful.Then the On/Off condition of determined wakeup time and/or HVAC system can pass to backboard processor for monitoring and waking object up.Backboard can wake head unit up at determined wakeup time or due to other reasons, and head unit can reevaluate its state and executing state transition or calculate and select another control strategy where necessary.
In some embodiments, calculating described here can be determined when each head unit wakes up.Head unit can be waken up because of a variety of causes, such as in order to look into the future set point, regulate in response to the temperature of user, based on stride across lower maintain band or upper maintain band, based on limit state change (such as, open based on PREDICTIVE CONTROL or close heat supply operation) etc.Such as, based on the selected PREDICTIVE CONTROL with least cost value, can determine head unit to be waken up after 20 minutes in heat supply.Wake head unit up after this 20 minutes interval after, head unit can perform calculating described here, and is minimized by value at cost, to determine whether extra heat supply is applicable to or whether heat supply operation should stop.Similarly, head unit can be waken up or perform and calculate to determine whether heat supply should start or whether HVAC unit can keep closing.If head unit is waken up due to any other reason (such as, proximity transducer saltus step etc.), then can perform above-described calculating to adjust heat supply control strategy and/or the cost function minimization of heat supply strategy will be used for.
In some embodiments, radiation feature described here may be embodied as the default system in thermostat.Such as, the heat supply of family can be identified as radiation by user, wherein will automatically apply predictive control algorithm described here.In some embodiments, by selecting the feature of suitable on/off buttons or inactive predictive control algorithm, user can determine inactive radiant heating algorithm.According to another embodiment, user can be pointed out to enable or radiant heating feature described here of stopping using, or can require that user will enable these features before these features of application.

Figure 22 shows the step for automatic system coupling, and described step is preferably performed by the same thermostat or thermostat control system that perform other HVAC control methods one or more described in the specification.Have been found that special need by select in the automatic control algolithm improved in multiple available energy-conservation and comfort level advisably thermostat is arranged and management user-friendly as far as possible, described control algolithm is suitable for the specific HVAC configuration of the family being provided with thermostat.In step 2202, can be used for being determined by least one in following by thermostat controlled HVAC system feature: (i) automatically electric wire inserts and detect, (ii) interactive user interview, (iii) the automatic deduction run based on the automatic trial of HVAC system when thermostat is installed or when installing close to thermostat or inference, and (iv) is based on the automatic deduction of the system action observed or performance or inference.The one or more middle description of example in US20120130679A1 and US20120203379A1 and attorney docket 94021-849698/NES0258-US of above-mentioned common transfer of this method.
Operate about refrigeration mode, if determine HVAC system to comprise artificial atmosphere (step 2204), it by special air-conditioning system and/or with the heat pump of the direction operation that freezes, then in step 2206, can enable intelligent preconditioning feature for refrigeration mode operates.An example of particularly advantageous intelligent preconditioning feature describes in above-mentioned attorney docket 94021-852484/NES0257-US.For some embodiments, intelligent preconditioning algorithm configuration becomes: the heat supply nearest by monitoring family and refrigeration history constantly know how soon family heats up or lower the temperature, and introduces external environmental information alternatively, such as external temperature, sun heating effect etc.; Predict that how long initiatively this HVAC system needs heat supply or freeze to reach predetermined set point; And start preconditioning in the lucky moment towards specific set point, make to reach the set point temperatures of plan in the set point moment of plan.Improve users'comfort by the set point temperatures not reaching this plan too late, and improve energy-conservation by the set point temperatures too early not reaching this plan.
About heat supply mode operation, if determine HVAC system to comprise radiant heating (step 2208), then in step 2218, for Intelligent Radiation controlling feature is enabled in heat supply mode operation.An example of particularly advantageous Intelligent Radiation controlling feature is described at this.For some embodiments, Intelligent Radiation controlling feature is configured to the circulation of ongoing basis monitoring radiant heating, calculate family by the thermal model of estimation during radiating system heat supply, and predictably control radiating system with the thermal model considering residence, the moment of one day and the mode of thermal cycle information before.Intelligent Radiation controlling feature is configured to realize comfortable maintenance band temperature, also the frequent change of HVAC On/Off state is minimized and HVAC is energy consumption minimized simultaneously.Except other advantages, avoid target temperature overshoot that is uncomfortable, energy dissipation.
If determine HVAC system to comprise heat pump, (namely this heat pump comprises the heat supply of auxiliary electrical resistive electricity, so-called auxiliary heat or AUX heat) (step 2210), if and further determined that (step 2212) thermostat interconnection network (make it can position-based data and receive external temperature information based on the temperature information source of the Internet) or external temperature information can be accessed (such as, external temperature sensor is connected to by wired or wireless), then enable intelligent heat pump controlling feature in step 2216.If (it is the most usually because there is conventional gas furnace to instead of heat pump not have the heat pump of AUX heat in step 2210, or because there is the heat pump do not comprised in the so-called bifuel system of AUX heat), then in step 2214 for heat pattern enables intelligent preconditioning feature, it can be similar or identical with the reserved portion of the above-mentioned preconditioning feature for refrigeration mode discussed about step 2206.Similarly, if do not have network to connect or other access external temperature information in step 2212, then do not enable the intelligent heat pump controlling feature of step 2216, but enable the intelligent preconditioning feature of step 2214.
Refer step 2216, an example of particularly advantageous intelligent heat pump controlling feature describes in above-mentioned attorney docket NES0122-US.Although AUX hot merit can allow family's heat supply more quickly, this is useful especially when external temperature is lower, heat pump compressor effect independent when external temperature is lower is less, but utilizes the energy cost of AUX heat may be generally 2 to 5 times of the energy cost utilizing separately heat pump.For some embodiments, intelligence heat pump controlling feature is configured to the circulation of ongoing basis monitoring heat pump heat supply, how soon to follow the trail of in view of relevant external air temperature by independent heat pump compressor to domestic heat (such as, in units of degrees Fahrenheit is per hour).Based on the relation between the effective heat input rate calculated and external air temperature, and comprise the Preferences of user in the scope of from " maximal comfort " to " maximum energy-conservation " (" balance " be included in these end points is selected) further, intelligent heat pump controlling feature starts AUX heat supply function advisably in the mode realizing the suitable balance between users'comfort and AUX heat cost.For some embodiments, the wise factor calling AUX heat of impact comprises (i) and uses independent heat pump to reach predicted time amount required for current temperature setpoint, (ii) current temperature setpoint to be produced by user's control inputs immediately or it be the temperature set-point of plan, and user preference arrived at " maximal comfort " in " maximum energy-conservation " scope of (iii) concrete selection.As a rule, when the time Estimate of independent compressor increases, it is more favourable that AUX function determines to call AUX heat, relative to the set point of plan, for user's control inputs immediately, it is more favourable that AUX function determines to call AUX heat, and compared to the preference that " maximum energy-conservation " points to, for the preference that " maximal comfort " points to, it is more favourable that AUX function determines to call AUX heat.
For some embodiments, intelligence heat pump controlling feature also provides the automatic adjustment of so-called AUX shut-down temperature based on monitored heat pump heat supply cyclical information and the user preference between " maximal comfort " and " maximum energy-conservation ", this AUX shut-down temperature corresponds to an external air temperature, on this external air temperature, AUX heat can not be opened.As a rule, AUX shut-down temperature for better performance heat pump lower (causing less use AUX), and when user preference tends to " maximum energy-conservation " also lower (causing less use AUX).For some embodiments, network wherein can be used to connect, make it possible to provide evening temperature forecast, intelligence heat pump controlling feature also provides evening temperature economy, if wherein based on temperature forecast in evening, when morning temporary needs AUX function reach set point temperatures in morning from set point temperatures in normal evening, then evening, set point temperatures may be elevated to the set point in evening higher than regular program.Advantageously, in this case, even if the temperature in evening of household internal wants high compared with its original temperature, but by avoiding carrying out Interim use AUX function in the morning, in fact user has saved the energy and money.
According to some embodiments, the decision made in the one or more steps in step 2208 and step 2210 can based on the HVAC system performance information automatically observed instead of concrete system identification information.Such as, can be such situation: the concrete heat supply function of HVAC system is not radiating system physically, and be intended to the symbol showing the high thermal mass be combined with essence control gains, make it be similar to radiant heating system in itself.For this situation, Intelligent Radiation controlling feature can be enabled with improving SNR.Similarly; may not be such situation: HVAC system has the heat pump of band AUX function; but it can have two benches heat supply function; wherein the first stage (the type may be elected to be the first stage be because it have higher cost efficiency) trend towards slowly under lower external temperature or " backwardness "; and wherein subordinate phase (it is because it has lower cost efficiency that the type may be elected to be subordinate phase) trending towards saving time very much to during domestic heat, the heat pump of the unusual image-tape AUX function of the effect therefore making this system.For this situation, intelligent heat pump controlling feature can be enabled with improving SNR.
Should be realized for the control to HVAC system although embodiments of the present invention are usual, design described here may be used for controlling various other system or device.Such as, historical data is utilized to may be used for controlling various home appliances or system to the idea producing PREDICTIVE CONTROL.Such as, the activity being equipped with the family of proximity transducer to may be used for detecting in family or take grade (that is, the occupant in family in one day be how movable and they where movable).These Activity Level data can be recorded and the forecast model of Activity Level for generation of family.Based on this model, the utensil of family can be controlled.Such as, such as, at dead of night when the less activity of occupant, the lamp in the region of less activity in history can be made dimmed, or occupant's WA can turn on lamp gradually in the morning.
This design can also be applied to and control external device (ED) or system, such as sprinkler systems.Such as, can measure and record or otherwise obtain the precipitation of peripheral region, these data can need the chart of how many water yields or curve map to compare with the usual or average lawn shown in this region.Forecast model can with this data fitting to adjust the irrigation times of water sprinkler and/or to water water volume based on the precipitation predicted or forecast.These data can also be provided to serve to help these service prediction to city or state or plan the needs in future of the family in this region.
But a lot of variants and modifications of the present invention becomes obvious without doubt for the those of ordinary skill in the art reading above-mentioned instructions, be understandable that, by shown by example and the embodiment described be intended to be thought of as restrictive never in any form.Therefore, the reference of the details of preferred implementation also their scope of not intended to be limiting.
