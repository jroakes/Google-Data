Definitions
- HVAC heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
- HVAC control systems To manage a thermal environment of a structure such as a residential or commercial building, one or more HVAC control systems are typically used. HVAC control systems need to make decisions as to how to condition the enclosure appropriately, which may include varying an internal heat, humidity, or other environmental characteristic. Since the enclosure has an associated thermal mass that needs to be heated or cooled, how and when the heating or cooling is carried out can greatly impact the energy efficiency as well as the cost of the process.
- U.S. Pat. No. 5,555,927 discusses an adapted recovery method for a setback thermostat using the intersection of the space temperature with a sloped recovery temperature line which approximates the change in temperature as a function of time during recovery of the temperature controlled space from the setback temperature, to determine the time at which recovery to the occupancy temperature should begin.
- the recovery line slope is re-calculated and updated.
- U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0192915 discusses a system for forecasting predicted thermal loads for a building including a neural-network-based thermal load predictor.
- the neural network can be trained using building data, occupancy data and actual weather conditions.
- a thermal condition forecaster uses a simple regression model based on forecasted high and low temperatures for a specific locale and measured local temperature and humidity observations made immediately prior to the prediction.
- thermodynamic models of a structure While such systems have evolved the technological field of HVAC control based on thermodynamic models of a structure, there remains significant room for improving the accuracy of the thermodynamic models in characterizing changes to a thermal environment of a structure over time as a result of actuation of an associated HVAC system.

- a method of determining a thermodynamic model of an enclosure associated with an HVAC system may include receiving temperature information for a period of time during which the HVAC system operates in a first state, the temperature information defining a temperature trajectory of the enclosure during the period of time.
- the method may also include determining a response interval that indicates an estimated time between when the HVAC system begins operating in the first state and when the temperature within the enclosure begins to change in a direction associated with the first state.
- the method may additionally include determining, using the temperature information, a plurality of weighting factors corresponding to a respective plurality of basis functions, the weighted combination of basis functions characterizing the temperature trajectory of the enclosure in response to the HVAC system operating in the first state.
- the plurality of basis functions may include a first basis function that is evaluated from a time that the HVAC system begins operating in the first state until a time when the response interval ends, and a second basis function that is evaluated beginning at the time when the response interval ends.
- a thermostat for controlling operations of an HVAC system in an enclosure.

- the operations may additionally include determining, using the temperature information, a plurality of weighting factors corresponding to a respective plurality of basis functions, the weighted combination of basis functions characterizing the temperature trajectory of the enclosure in response to the HVAC system operating in the first state.
- the plurality of basis functions may include a first basis function that is evaluated from a time that the HVAC system begins operating in the first state until a time when the response interval ends, and a second basis function that is evaluated beginning at the time when the response interval ends.
- a tangible, non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium may include instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform operations including receiving temperature information for a period of time during which the HVAC system operates in a first state, the temperature information defining a temperature trajectory of the enclosure during the period of time.
- the operations may also include determining a response interval that indicates an estimated time between when the HVAC system begins operating in the first state and when the temperature within the enclosure begins to change in a direction associated with the first state.

- legacy appliances 142 such as infrared (“IR”) controlled wall air conditioners or other IR-controlled devices, which can be controlled by IR signals provided by the smart hazard detectors 104 or the smart wall switches 108 .
- the smart thermostats 102 , the smart hazard detectors 104 , the smart doorbells 106 , the smart wall switches 108 , the smart wall plugs 110 , and other devices of the smart-home environment 100 are modular and can be incorporated into older and new houses.
- the devices are designed around a modular platform consisting of two basic components: a head unit and a backplate, which is also referred to as a docking station. Multiple configurations of the docking station are provided so as to be compatible with any home, such as older and newer homes.
- all of the docking stations include a standard head-connection arrangement, such that any head unit can be removably attached to any docking station.
- the docking stations are interfaces that serve as physical connections to the structure and the voltage wiring of the homes, and the interchangeable head units contain all of the sensors, processors, user interfaces, the batteries, and other functional components of the devices.
- the head unit can ask the user (by 2D LCD display, 2D/3D holographic projection, voice interaction, etc.) a few simple questions such as, “Where am I” and the user can indicate “living room”, “kitchen” and so forth.
- the smart-home environment 100 may also include communication with devices outside of the physical home but within a proximate geographical range of the home.
- the smart-home environment 100 may include a pool heater monitor 114 that communicates a current pool temperature to other devices within the smart-home environment 100 or receives commands for controlling the pool temperature.
- the smart-home environment 100 may include an irrigation monitor 116 that communicates information regarding irrigation systems within the smart-home environment 100 and/or receives control information for controlling such irrigation systems.
- an algorithm is provided for considering the geographic location of the smart-home environment 100 , such as based on the zip code or geographic coordinates of the home. The geographic information is then used to obtain data helpful for determining optimal times for watering, such data may include sun location information, temperature, due point, soil type of the land on which the home is located, etc.
- one or more of the smart-home devices of FIG. 1 can further allow a user to interact with the device even if the user is not proximate to the device.
- a user can communicate with a device using a computer (e.g., a desktop computer, laptop computer, or tablet) or other portable electronic device (e.g., a smartphone) 166 .
- a webpage or app can be configured to receive communications from the user and control the device based on the communications and/or to present information about the device's operation to the user.
- the user can view a current setpoint temperature for a device and adjust it using a computer.
- the user can be in the structure during this remote communication or outside the structure.
- users can control the smart thermostat and other smart devices in the smart-home environment 100 using a network-connected computer or portable electronic device 166 .
- some or all of the occupants e.g., individuals who live in the home
- Such registration can be made at a central server to authenticate the occupant and/or the device as being associated with the home and to give permission to the occupant to use the device to control the smart devices in the home.
- An occupant can use their registered device 166 to remotely control the smart devices of the home, such as when the occupant is at work or on vacation.
- the occupant may also use their registered device to control the smart devices when the occupant is actually located inside the home, such as when the occupant is sitting on a couch inside the home. It should be appreciated that instead of or in addition to registering devices 166 , the smart-home environment 100 makes inferences about which individuals live in the home and are therefore occupants and which devices 166 are associated with those individuals. As such, the smart-home environment “learns” who is an occupant and permits the devices 166 associated with those individuals to control the smart devices of the home.
- the smart-home environment may receive communication from an unregistered mobile device of an individual inside of the home, where said individual is not recognized as an occupant of the home. Further, for example, a smart-home environment may receive communication from a mobile device of an individual who is known to be or who is registered as a guest.
- a guest-layer of controls can be provided to guests of the smart-home environment 100 .
- the guest-layer of controls gives guests access to basic controls (e.g., a judicially selected subset of features of the smart devices), such as temperature adjustments, but it locks out other functionalities.
- the guest layer of controls can be thought of as a “safe sandbox” in which guests have limited controls, but they do not have access to more advanced controls that could fundamentally alter, undermine, damage, or otherwise impair the occupant-desired operation of the smart devices. For example, the guest layer of controls will not permit the guest to adjust the heat-pump lockout temperature.
- a use case example of this is when a guest is in a smart home, the guest could walk up to the thermostat and turn the dial manually, but the guest may not want to walk around the house “hunting” for the thermostat, especially at night while the home is dark and others are sleeping. Further, the guest may not want to go through the hassle of downloading the necessary application to their device for remotely controlling the thermostat. In fact, the guest may not have the home owner's login credentials, etc., and therefore cannot remotely control the thermostat via such an application. Accordingly, according to embodiments of the invention, the guest can open a mobile browser on their mobile device, type a keyword, such as “NEST” into the URL field and tap “Go” or “Search”, etc.
- the device presents the guest with a user interface which allows the guest to move the target temperature between a limited range, such as 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
- a user interface provides a guest layer of controls that are limited to basic functions. The guest cannot change the target humidity, modes, or view energy history.
- a local webserver is provided that is accessible in the local area network (LAN). It does not require a password, because physical presence inside the home is established reliably enough by the guest's presence on the LAN.
- the home owner is asked if they want to enable a Local Web App (LWA) on the smart device.
- LWA Local Web App
- Business owners will likely say no; home owners will likely say yes.
- the smart device broadcasts to the LAN that the above referenced keyword, such as “NEST”, is now a host alias for its local web server.
- a guest layer of controls may also be provided to users by means other than a device 166 .
- the smart device such as the smart thermostat, may be equipped with walkup-identification technology (e.g., face recognition, RFID, ultrasonic sensors) that “fingerprints” or creates a “signature” for the occupants of the home.
- the walkup-identification technology can be the same as or similar to the fingerprinting and signature creating techniques descripted in other sections of this application.
- the smart device provides the guest with the guest layer of controls, rather than full controls.
- the smart thermostat and other smart devices “learn” by observing occupant behavior. For example, the smart thermostat learns occupants' preferred temperature set-points for mornings and evenings, and it learns when the occupants are asleep or awake, as well as when the occupants are typically away or at home, for example. According to embodiments, when a guest controls the smart devices, such as the smart thermostat, the smart devices do not “learn” from the guest. This prevents the guest's adjustments and controls from affecting the learned preferences of the occupants.
- a smart television remote control recognizes occupants by thumbprint, visual identification, RFID, etc., and it recognizes a user as a guest or as someone belonging to a particular class having limited control and access (e.g., child).
- the smart remote control Upon recognizing the user as a guest or someone belonging to a limited class, the smart remote control only permits that user to view a subset of channels and to make limited adjustments to the settings of the television and other devices. For example, a guest cannot adjust the digital video recorder (DVR) settings, and a child is limited to viewing child-appropriate programming.
- DVR digital video recorder
- sinks, bathtubs, and showers can be controlled by smart spigots that recognize users as guests or as children and therefore prevent water from exceeding a designated temperature that is considered safe.
- each of the devices 102 , 104 , 106 , 108 , 110 , 112 , 114 , 116 , 118 , 166 , and 170 is capable of data communications and information sharing with any other of the smart devices, as well as to any central server or cloud-computing system or any other device that is network-connected within the smart-home environment 100 or anywhere else in the world.
- the required data communications can be carried out using any of a variety of custom or standard wireless protocols (Wi-Fi, ZigBee, 6LoWPAN, etc.) and/or any of a variety of custom or standard wired protocols (CAT6 Ethernet, HomePlug, etc.)
- all or some of the smart devices can serve as wireless or wired repeaters.
- a first one of the smart devices can communicate with a second one of the smart device via a wireless router 160 .
- the smart devices can further communicate with each other via a connection to a network, such as the Internet 162 .
- the smart devices can communicate with a central server or a cloud-computing system 164 .
- the central server or cloud-computing system 164 can be associated with a manufacturer, support entity, or service provider associated with the device.
- a user may be able to contact customer support using a device itself rather than needing to use other communication means such as a telephone or Internet-connected computer.
- software updates can be automatically sent from the central server or cloud-computing system 164 to devices (e.g., when available, when purchased, or at routine intervals).
- the smart devices combine to create a mesh network of spokesman and low-power nodes in the smart-home environment 100 , where some of the smart devices are “spokesman” nodes and others are “low-powered” nodes. Some of the smart devices in the smart-home environment 100 are battery powered, while others have a regular and reliable power source, such as by connecting to wiring (e.g., to 120V line voltage wires) behind the walls 154 of the smart-home environment. The smart devices that have a regular and reliable power source are referred to as “spokesman” nodes.
- nodes are equipped with the capability of using any wireless protocol or manner to facilitate bidirectional communication with any of a variety of other devices in the smart-home environment 100 as well as with the central server or cloud-computing system 164 .
- the devices that are battery powered are referred to as “low-power” nodes.
- These nodes tend to be smaller than spokesman nodes and, in some embodiments, may only communicate using wireless protocols that require very little power, such as Zigbee, ZWave, Bluetooth, 6LoWPAN, etc. Further, some, but not all, low-power nodes may be incapable of bidirectional communication. These low-power nodes may send messages, but they may be unable to “listen” for incoming messages. Thus, other devices in the smart-home environment 100 , such as the spokesman nodes, may not send information to these low-power nodes.
- the smart devices serve as low-power and spokesman nodes to create a mesh network in the smart-home environment 100 .
- Individual low-power nodes in the smart-home environment regularly send out messages regarding what they are sensing, and the other low-powered nodes in the smart-home environment—in addition to sending out their own messages—repeat the messages, thereby causing the messages to travel from node to node (i.e., device to device) throughout the smart-home environment 100 .
- the spokesman nodes in the smart-home environment 100 are able to “drop down” to low-powered communication protocols to receive these messages, translate the messages to other communication protocols, and send the translated messages to other spokesman nodes and/or the central server or cloud-computing system 164 .
- the low-powered nodes using low-power communication protocols are able to send messages across the entire smart-home environment 100 as well as over the Internet 162 to the central server or cloud-computing system 164 .
- the mesh network enables the central server or cloud-computing system 164 to regularly receive data from all of the smart devices in the home, make inferences based on the data, and send commands back to one of the smart devices to accomplish some of the smart-home objectives descried herein.
- the spokesman nodes and some of the low-powered nodes are capable of “listening”. Accordingly, users, other devices, and the central server or cloud-computing system 164 can communicate control information to the low-powered nodes.
- a user can use the portable electronic device (e.g., a smartphone) 166 to send commands over the Internet to the central server or cloud-computing system 164 , which then relays the commands to the spokesman nodes in the smart-home environment 100 .
- the spokesman nodes drop down to a low-power protocol to communicate the commands to the low-power nodes throughout the smart-home environment, as well as to other spokesman nodes that did not receive the commands directly from the central server or cloud-computing system 164 .
- a low-power node is a smart nightlight 170 .
- the smart nightlight 170 houses an occupancy sensor, such as an ultrasonic or passive IR sensor, and an ambient light sensor, such as a photoresistor or a single-pixel sensor that measures light in the room.
- the smart nightlight 170 is configured to activate the light source when its ambient light sensor detects that the room is dark and when its occupancy sensor detects that someone is in the room. In other embodiments, the smart nightlight 170 is simply configured to activate the light source when its ambient light sensor detects that the room is dark.
- the smart nightlight 170 includes a low-power wireless communication chip (e.g., ZigBee chip) that regularly sends out messages regarding the occupancy of the room and the amount of light in the room, including instantaneous messages coincident with the occupancy sensor detecting the presence of a person in the room.
- these messages may be sent wirelessly, using the mesh network, from node to node (i.e., smart device to smart device) within the smart-home environment 100 as well as over the Internet 162 to the central server or cloud-computing system 164 .
- low-powered nodes include battery-operated versions of the smart hazard detectors 104 .
- These smart hazard detectors 104 are often located in an area without access to constant and reliable power and, as discussed in detail below, may include any number and type of sensors, such as smoke/fire/heat sensors, carbon monoxide/dioxide sensors, occupancy/motion sensors, ambient light sensors, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, and the like.
- smart hazard detectors 104 can send messages that correspond to each of the respective sensors to the other devices and the central server or cloud-computing system 164 , such as by using the mesh network as described above.
- spokesman nodes examples include smart doorbells 106 , smart thermostats 102 , smart wall switches 108 , and smart wall plugs 110 . These devices 102 , 106 , 108 , and 110 are often located near and connected to a reliable power source, and therefore can include more power-consuming components, such as one or more communication chips capable of bidirectional communication in any variety of protocols.
- these low-powered and spokesman nodes can function as “tripwires” for an alarm system in the smart-home environment. For example, in the event a perpetrator circumvents detection by alarm sensors located at windows, doors, and other entry points of the smart-home environment 100 , the alarm could be triggered upon receiving an occupancy, motion, heat, sound, etc. message from one or more of the low-powered and spokesman nodes in the mesh network.
- the central server or cloud-computing system 164 or some other device could trigger an alarm, provided the alarm is armed at the time of detection.
- the alarm system could be enhanced by various low-powered and spokesman nodes located throughout the smart-home environment 100 .
- a user could enhance the security of the smart-home environment 100 by buying and installing extra smart nightlights 170 .
- the mesh network can be used to automatically turn on and off lights as a person transitions from room to room.
- the low-powered and spokesman nodes e.g., devices 102 , 104 , 106 , 108 , 110 , 112 , and 170 .
- the central server or cloud-computing system 164 or some other device activates and deactivates the smart wall switches 108 to automatically provide light as the person moves from room to room in the smart-home environment 100 .
- users may provide pre-configuration information that indicates which smart wall plugs 110 provide power to lamps and other light sources, such as the smart nightlight 170 .
- this mapping of light sources to wall plugs 110 can be done automatically (e.g., the smart wall plugs 110 detect when a light source is plugged into it, and it sends a corresponding message to the central server or cloud-computing system 164 ).
- the central server or cloud-computing system 164 or some other device activates and deactivates the smart wall plugs 110 that provide power to lamps and other light sources so as to track the person's movement and provide light as the person moves from room to room.
- the mesh network of low-powered and spokesman nodes can be used to provide exit lighting in the event of an emergency.
- users provide pre-configuration information that indicates exit routes in the smart-home environment 100 . For example, for each room in the house, the user provides a map of the best exit route.
- the central server or cloud-computing system 164 or some other device could automatically determine the routes using uploaded maps, diagrams, architectural drawings of the smart-home house, as well as using a map generated based on positional information obtained from the nodes of the mesh network (e.g., positional information from the devices is used to construct a map of the house).
- the central server or cloud-computing system 164 or some other device uses occupancy information obtained from the low-powered and spokesman nodes to determine which rooms are occupied and then turns on lights (e.g., nightlights 170 , wall switches 108 , wall plugs 110 that power lamps, etc.) along the exit routes from the occupied rooms so as to provide emergency exit lighting.
- lights e.g., nightlights 170 , wall switches 108 , wall plugs 110 that power lamps, etc.

- the service robots 118 can be respectively configured to perform floor sweeping, floor washing, etc. in a manner similar to that of known commercially available devices such as the ROOMBATM and SCOOBATM products sold by iRobot, Inc. of Bedford, Mass.
- Tasks such as floor sweeping and floor washing can be considered as “away” or “while-away” tasks for purposes of the instant description, as it is generally more desirable for these tasks to be performed when the occupants are not present.
- one or more of the service robots 118 are configured to perform tasks such as playing music for an occupant, serving as a localized thermostat for an occupant, serving as a localized air monitor/purifier for an occupant, serving as a localized baby monitor, serving as a localized hazard detector for an occupant, and so forth, it being generally more desirable for such tasks to be carried out in the immediate presence of the human occupant.
- tasks can be considered as “human-facing” or “human-centric” tasks.
- a particular one of the service robots 118 can be considered to be facilitating what can be called a “personal comfort-area network” for the occupant, with the objective being to keep the occupant's immediate space at a comfortable temperature wherever that occupant may be located in the home.
- a personal comfort-area network for the occupant
- the localized-thermostat service robot 118 is configured to move itself into the immediate presence (e.g., within five feet) of a particular occupant who has settled into a particular location in the home (e.g. in the dining room to eat their breakfast and read the news).
- the localized-thermostat service robot 118 includes a temperature sensor, a processor, and wireless communication components configured such that control communications with the HVAC system, either directly or through a wall-mounted wirelessly communicating thermostat coupled to the HVAC system, are maintained and such that the temperature in the immediate vicinity of the occupant is maintained at their desired level. If the occupant then moves and settles into another location (e.g. to the living room couch to watch television), the localized-thermostat service robot 118 proceeds to move and park itself next to the couch and keep that particular immediate space at a comfortable temperature.
- the localized-thermostat service robot 118 can identify and locate the occupant whose personal-area space is to be kept at a comfortable temperature
- RFID sensing e.g., person having an RFID bracelet, RFID necklace, or RFID key fob
- a particular service robot 118 When serving as a localized air monitor/purifier for an occupant, a particular service robot 118 can be considered to be facilitating what can be called a “personal health-area network” for the occupant, with the objective being to keep the air quality in the occupant's immediate space at healthy levels.
- other health-related functions can be provided, such as monitoring the temperature or heart rate of the occupant (e.g., using finely remote sensors, near-field communication with on-person monitors, etc.).
- a particular service robot 118 When serving as a localized hazard detector for an occupant, a particular service robot 118 can be considered to be facilitating what can be called a “personal safety-area network” for the occupant, with the objective being to ensure there is no excessive carbon monoxide, smoke, fire, etc., in the immediate space of the occupant.
- Methods analogous to those described above for personal comfort-area networks in terms of occupant identifying and tracking are likewise applicable for personal health-area network and personal safety-area network embodiments.
- the above-referenced facilitation of personal comfort-area networks, personal health-area networks, personal safety-area networks, and/or other such human-facing functionalities of the service robots 118 are further enhanced by logical integration with other smart sensors in the home according to rules-based inferencing techniques or artificial intelligence techniques for achieving better performance of those human-facing functionalities and/or for achieving those goals in energy-conserving or other resource-conserving ways.
- the air monitor/purifier service robot 118 can be configured to detect whether a household pet is moving toward the currently settled location of the occupant (e.g., using on-board sensors and/or by data communications with other smart-home sensors along with rules-based inferencing/artificial intelligence techniques), and if so, the air purifying rate is immediately increased in preparation for the arrival of more airborne pet dander.
- the hazard detector service robot 118 can be advised by other smart-home sensors that the temperature and humidity levels are rising in the kitchen, which is nearby to the occupant's current dining room location, and responsive to this advisory the hazard detector service robot 118 will temporarily raise a hazard detection threshold, such as a smoke detection threshold, under an inference that any small increases in ambient smoke levels will most likely be due to cooking activity and not due to a genuinely hazardous condition.
- a hazard detection threshold such as a smoke detection threshold
- the above-described “human-facing” and “away” functionalities can be provided, without limitation, by multiple distinct service robots 118 having respective dedicated ones of such functionalities, by a single service robot 118 having an integration of two or more different ones of such functionalities, and/or any combinations thereof (including the ability for a single service robot 118 to have both “away” and “human facing” functionalities) without departing from the scope of the present teachings.
- Electrical power can be provided by virtue of rechargeable batteries or other rechargeable methods, with FIG. 1 illustrating an exemplary out-of-the-way docking station 164 to which the service robots 118 will automatically dock and recharge its batteries (if needed) during periods of inactivity.
- each service robot 118 includes wireless communication components that facilitate data communications with one or more of the other wirelessly communicating smart-home sensors of FIG. 1 and/or with one or more other service robots 118 (e.g., using Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Z-Wave, 6LoWPAN, etc.), and one or more of the smart-home devices of FIG. 1 can be in communication with a remote server over the Internet.
- each service robot 118 can be configured to communicate directly with a remote server by virtue of cellular telephone communications, satellite communications, 3 G/4 G network data communications, or other direct communication method.
- inventions are systems and methods relating to the integration of the service robot(s) 118 with home security sensors and related functionalities of the smart home system.
- the embodiments are particularly applicable and advantageous when applied for those service robots 118 that perform “away” functionalities or that otherwise are desirable to be active when the home is unoccupied (hereinafter “away-service robots”).
- away-service robots Included in the embodiments are methods and systems for ensuring that home security systems, intrusion detection systems, and/or occupancy-sensitive environmental control systems (for example, occupancy-sensitive automated setback thermostats that enter into a lower-energy-using condition when the home is unoccupied) are not erroneously triggered by the away-service robots.
- a home automation and security system e.g., as shown in FIG. 1
- a monitoring service by virtue of automated systems (e.g., cloud-based servers or other central servers, hereinafter “central server”) that are in data communications with one or more network-connected elements of the home automation and security system.
- the away-service robots are configured to be in operative data communication with the central server, and are configured such that they remain in a non-away-service state (e.g., a dormant state at their docking station) unless permission is granted from the central server (e.g., by virtue of an “away-service-OK” message from the central server) to commence their away-service activities.
- An away-state determination made by the system which can be arrived at (i) exclusively by local on-premises smart device(s) based on occupancy sensor data, (ii) exclusively by the central server based on received occupancy sensor data and/or based on received proximity-related information such as GPS coordinates from user smartphones or automobiles, or (iii) any combination of (i) and (ii) can then trigger the granting of away-service permission to the away-service robots by the central server.
- the central server can readily filter signals from the occupancy sensing devices to distinguish between the away-service robot activity versus any unexpected intrusion activity, thereby avoiding a false intrusion alarm condition while also ensuring that the home is secure.
- the central server may provide filtering data (such as an expected occupancy-sensing profile triggered by the away-service robots) to the occupancy sensing nodes or associated processing nodes of the smart home, such that the filtering is performed at the local level.
- filtering data such as an expected occupancy-sensing profile triggered by the away-service robots
- the central server may temporarily disable the occupancy sensing equipment for the duration of the away-service robot activity.
- functionality similar to that of the central server in the above example can be performed by an on-site computing device such as a dedicated server computer, a “master” home automation console or panel, or as an adjunct function of one or more of the smart-home devices of FIG. 1 .
- an on-site computing device such as a dedicated server computer, a “master” home automation console or panel, or as an adjunct function of one or more of the smart-home devices of FIG. 1 .
- the home security systems and/or occupancy-sensitive environmental controls that would be triggered by the motion, noise, vibrations, or other disturbances of the away-service robot activity are referenced simply as “activity sensing systems,” and when so triggered will yield a “disturbance-detected” outcome representative of the false trigger (for example, an alarm message to a security service, or an “arrival” determination for an automated setback thermostat that causes the home to be heated or cooled to a more comfortable “occupied” setpoint temperature).
- the away-service robots are configured to emit a standard ultrasonic sound throughout the course of their away-service activity
- the activity sensing systems are configured to detect that standard ultrasonic sound
- the activity sensing systems are further configured such that no disturbance-detected outcome will occur for as long as that standard ultrasonic sound is detected.
- the away-service robots are configured to emit a standard notification signal throughout the course of their away-service activity
- the activity sensing systems are configured to detect that standard notification signal
- the activity sensing systems are further configured such that no disturbance-detected outcome will occur for as long as that standard notification signal is detected
- the standard notification signal comprises one or more of: an optical notifying signal; an audible notifying signal; an infrared notifying signal; an infrasonic notifying signal; a wirelessly transmitted data notification signal (e.g., an IP broadcast, multicast, or unicast notification signal, or a notification message sent in an TCP/IP two-way communication session).
- the notification signals sent by the away-service robots to the activity sensing systems are authenticated and encrypted such that the notifications cannot be learned and replicated by a potential burglar.
- Any of a variety of known encryption/authentication schemes can be used to ensure such data security including, but not limited to, methods involving third party data security services or certificate authorities.
- a permission request-response model can be used, wherein any particular away-service robot requests permission from each activity sensing system in the home when it is ready to perform its away-service tasks, and does not initiate such activity until receiving a “yes” or “permission granted” message from each activity sensing system (or from a single activity sensing system serving as a “spokesman” for all of the activity sensing systems).
- One advantage of the described embodiments that do not require a central event orchestrator is that there can (optionally) be more of an arms-length relationship between the supplier(s) of the home security/environmental control equipment, on the one hand, and the supplier(s) of the away-service robot(s), on the other hand, as it is only required that there is the described standard one-way notification protocol or the described standard two-way request/permission protocol to be agreed upon by the respective suppliers.
- the activity sensing systems are configured to detect sounds, vibrations, RF emissions, or other detectable environmental signals or “signatures” that are intrinsically associated with the away-service activity of each away-service robot, and are further configured such that no disturbance-detected outcome will occur for as long as that particular detectable signal or environmental “signature” is detected.
- a particular kind of vacuum-cleaning away-service robot may emit a specific sound or RF signature.
- the away-service environmental signatures for each of a plurality of known away-service robots are stored in the memory of the activity sensing systems based on empirically collected data, the environmental signatures being supplied with the activity sensing systems and periodically updated by a remote update server.
- the activity sensing systems can be placed into a “training mode” for the particular home in which they are installed, wherein they “listen” and “learn” the particular environmental signatures of the away-service robots for that home during that training session, and thereafter will suppress disturbance-detected outcomes for intervals in which those environmental signatures are heard.
- the activity sensing system is configured to automatically learn the environmental signatures for the away-service robots by virtue of automatically performing correlations over time between detected environmental signatures and detected occupancy activity.
- an intelligent automated nonoccupancy-triggered setback thermostat such as the Nest Learning Thermostat can be configured to constantly monitor for audible and RF activity as well as to perform infrared-based occupancy detection.
- the environmental signature of the away-service robot will remain relatively constant from event to event, and in view of the fact that the away-service events will likely either (a) themselves be triggered by some sort of nonoccupancy condition as measured by the away-service robots themselves, or (b) occur at regular times of day, there will be patterns in the collected data by which the events themselves will become apparent and for which the environmental signatures can be readily learned.
- the environmental signatures of the away-service robots are automatically learned without requiring user interaction, it is more preferable that a certain number of false triggers be tolerable over the course of the learning process.
- this automatic-learning embodiment is more preferable for application in occupancy-sensitive environmental control equipment (such as an automated setback thermostat) rather than home security systems for the reason that a few false occupancy determinations may cause a few instances of unnecessary heating or cooling, but will not otherwise have any serious consequences, whereas false home security alarms may have more serious consequences.
- occupancy-sensitive environmental control equipment such as an automated setback thermostat
- technologies including the sensors of the smart devices located in the mesh network of the smart-home environment in combination with rules-based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at the central server or cloud-computing system 164 are used to provide a personal “smart alarm clock” for individual occupants of the home.
- user-occupants can communicate with the central server or cloud-computing system 164 via their mobile devices 166 to access an interface for the smart alarm clock.
- occupants can turn on their “smart alarm clock” and input a wake time for the next day and/or for additional days.
- the occupant may have the option of setting a specific wake time for each day of the week, as well as the option of setting some or all of the inputted wake times to “repeat”.
- Artificial intelligence will be used to consider the occupant's response to these alarms when they go off and make inferences about the user's preferred sleep patterns over time.
- the smart device in the smart-home environment 100 that happens to be closest to the occupant when the occupant falls asleep will be the device that transmits messages regarding when the occupant stopped moving, from which the central server or cloud-computing system 164 will make inferences about where and when the occupant prefers to sleep.
- This closest smart device will be the device that sounds the alarm to wake the occupant.
- the “smart alarm clock” will follow the occupant throughout the house, by tracking the individual occupants based on their “unique signature”, which is determined based on data obtained from sensors located in the smart devices.
- the sensors include ultrasonic sensors, passive IR sensors, and the like.
- the unique signature is based on a combination of walking gate, patterns of movement, voice, height, size, etc. It should be appreciated that facial recognition may also be used.
- the wake times associated with the “smart alarm clock” are used by the smart thermostat 102 to control the HVAC in an efficient manner so as to pre-heat or cool the house to the occupant's desired “sleeping” and “awake” temperature settings.
- the preferred settings can be learned over time, such as by observing which temperature the occupant sets the thermostat to before going to sleep and which temperature the occupant sets the thermostat to upon waking up.
- a device is positioned proximate to the occupant's bed, such as on an adjacent nightstand, and collects data as the occupant sleeps using noise sensors, motion sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, IR, and optical), etc.
- Data may be obtained by the other smart devices in the room as well.
- Such data may include the occupant's breathing patterns, heart rate, movement, etc. Inferences are made based on this data in combination with data that indicates when the occupant actually wakes up. For example, if—on a regular basis—the occupant's heart rate, breathing, and moving all increase by 5% to 10%, twenty to thirty minutes before the occupant wakes up each morning, then predictions can be made regarding when the occupant is going to wake.
- predictions to provide other smart-home objectives such as adjusting the smart thermostat 102 so as to pre-heat or cool the home to the occupant's desired setting before the occupant wakes up. Further, these predictions can be used to set the “smart alarm clock” for the occupant, to turn on lights, etc.
- technologies including the sensors of the smart devices located throughout the smart-home environment in combination with rules-based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at the central server or cloud-computing system 164 are used to detect or monitor the progress of Alzheimer's Disease.
- the unique signatures of the occupants are used to track the individual occupants' movement throughout the smart-home environment 100 .
- This data can be aggregated and analyzed to identify patterns indicative of Alzheimer's.
- individuals with Alzheimer's have distinctive patterns of migration in their homes. For example, a person will walk to the kitchen and stand there for a while, then to the living room and stand there for a while, and then back to the kitchen. This pattern will take about thirty minutes, and then the person will repeat the pattern.
- the remote servers or cloud computing architectures 164 analyze the person's migration data collected by the mesh network of the smart-home environment to identify such patterns.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a network-level view of an extensible devices and services platform 200 with which a plurality of smart-home environments, such as the smart-home environment 100 of FIG. 1 , can be integrated.

- the devices and services platform 200 communicates with and collects data from a plurality of smart-home environments across the world.
- the central server or cloud-computing system 164 can collect home data 202 from the devices of one or more smart-home environments, where the devices can routinely transmit home data or can transmit home data in specific instances (e.g., when a device queries the home data 202 ).
- the devices and services platform 200 routinely collects data from homes across the world.
- the collected home data 202 includes, for example, power consumption data, occupancy data, HVAC settings and usage data, carbon monoxide levels data, carbon dioxide levels data, volatile organic compounds levels data, sleeping schedule data, cooking schedule data, inside and outside temperature humidity data, television viewership data, inside and outside noise level data, etc.
- the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 can further provide one or more services 204 .
- the services 204 can include, e.g., software updates, customer support, sensor data collection/logging, remote access, remote or distributed control, or use suggestions (e.g., based on collected home data 202 to improve performance, reduce utility cost, etc.).
- Data associated with the services 204 can be stored at the central server or cloud-computing system 164 and the central server or the cloud-computing system 164 can retrieve and transmit the data at an appropriate time (e.g., at regular intervals, upon receiving a request from a user, etc.).
- an embodiment of the extensible devices and services platform 200 includes a processing engine 206 , which can be concentrated at a single server or distributed among several different computing entities without limitation.
- the processing engine 206 can include engines configured to receive data from devices of smart-home environments (e.g., via the Internet or a hubbed network), to index the data, to analyze the data and/or to generate statistics based on the analysis or as part of the analysis.
- the analyzed data can be stored as derived home data 208 .
- Results of the analysis or statistics can thereafter be transmitted back to the device that provided home data used to derive the results, to other devices, to a server providing a webpage to a user of the device, or to other non-device entities.

- the results or statistics can be provided via the Internet 162 .
- the processing engine 206 can be configured and programmed to derive a variety of useful information from the home data 202 .
- a single server can include one or more engines.
- the derived data can be highly beneficial at a variety of different granularities for a variety of useful purposes, ranging from explicit programmed control of the devices on a per-home, per-neighborhood, or per-region basis (for example, demand-response programs for electrical utilities), to the generation of inferential abstractions that can assist on a per-home basis (for example, an inference can be drawn that the homeowner has left for vacation and so security detection equipment can be put on heightened sensitivity), to the generation of statistics and associated inferential abstractions that can be used for government or charitable purposes.
- processing engine 206 can generate statistics about device usage across a population of devices and send the statistics to device users, service providers or other entities (e.g., that have requested or may have provided monetary compensation for the statistics).
- the home data 202 , the derived home data 208 , and/or another data can be used to create “automated neighborhood safety networks.”
- the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 receives data indicating that a particular home has been broken into, is experiencing a fire, or some other type of emergency event, an alarm is sent to other smart homes in the “neighborhood.”
- the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 automatically identifies smart homes within a radius of the home experiencing the emergency and sends an alarm to the identified homes.
- the other homes in the “neighborhood” do not have to sign up for or register to be a part of a safety network, but instead are notified of an emergency based on their proximity to the location of the emergency.
- this can be an opt-in service and that, in addition to or instead of the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 selecting which homes to send alerts to, individuals can subscribe to participate in such networks and individuals can specify which homes they want to receive alerts from. This can include, for example, the homes of family members who live in different cities, such that individuals can receive alerts when their loved ones in other locations are experiencing an emergency.
- sound, vibration, and/or motion sensing components of the smart devices are used to detect sound, vibration, and/or motion created by running water.
- the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 makes inferences about water usage in the home and provides related services.
- the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 can run programs/algorithms that recognize what water sounds like and when it is running in the home.
- the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 to map the various water sources of the home, upon detecting running water, the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 sends a message an occupant's mobile device asking if water is currently running or if water has been recently run in the home and, if so, which room and which water-consumption appliance (e.g., sink, shower, toilet, etc.) was the source of the water. This enables the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 to determine the “signature” or “fingerprint” of each water source in the home. This is sometimes referred to herein as “audio fingerprinting water usage.”
- the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 creates a signature for the toilet in the master bathroom, and whenever that toilet is flushed, the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 will know that the water usage at that time is associated with that toilet.
- the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 can track the water usage of that toilet as well as each water-consumption application in the home. This information can be correlated to water bills or smart water meters so as to provide users with a breakdown of their water usage.
- sound, vibration, and/or motion sensing components of the smart devices are used to detect sound, vibration, and/or motion created by mice and other rodents as well as by termites, cockroaches, and other insects (collectively referred to as “pests”).
- the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 makes inferences about pest-detection in the home and provides related services.
- the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 can run programs/algorithms that recognize what certain pests sound like, how they move, and/or the vibration they create, individually and/or collectively.
- the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 can determine the “signatures” of particular types of pests.
- the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 detects sounds that may be associated with pests, it notifies the occupants of such sounds and suggests hiring a pest control company. If it is confirmed that pests are indeed present, the occupants input to the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 confirms that its detection was correct, along with details regarding the identified pests, such as name, type, description, location, quantity, etc. This enables the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 to “tune” itself for better detection and create “signatures” or “fingerprints” for specific types of pests.
- the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 can use the tuning as well as the signatures and fingerprints to detect pests in other homes, such as nearby homes that may be experiencing problems with the same pests. Further, for example, in the event that two or more homes in a “neighborhood” are experiencing problems with the same or similar types of pests, the central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 can make inferences that nearby homes may also have such problems or may be susceptible to having such problems, and it can send warning messages to those homes to help facilitate early detection and prevention.
- the devices and services platform 200 expose a range of application programming interfaces (APIs) 210 to third parties, such as charities 222 , governmental entities 224 (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration or the Environmental Protection Agency), academic institutions 226 (e.g., university researchers), businesses 228 (e.g., providing device warranties or service to related equipment, targeting advertisements based on home data), utility companies 230 , and other third parties.
- the APIs 210 are coupled to and permit third-party systems to communicate with the central server or the cloud-computing system 164 , including the services 204 , the processing engine 206 , the home data 202 , and the derived home data 208 .
- the APIs 210 allow applications executed by the third parties to initiate specific data processing tasks that are executed by the central server or the cloud-computing system 164 , as well as to receive dynamic updates to the home data 202 and the derived home data 208 .
- third parties can develop programs and/or applications, such as web or mobile applications, that integrate with the central server or the cloud-computing system 164 to provide services and information to users.
- programs and applications may be, for example, designed to help users reduce energy consumption, to preemptively service faulty equipment, to prepare for high service demands, to track past service performance, etc., or to perform any of a variety of beneficial functions or tasks now known or hereinafter developed.
- third-party applications make inferences from the home data 202 and the derived home data 208 , such inferences may include when are occupants home, when are they sleeping, when are they cooking, when are they in the den watching television, and when do they shower.
- the answers to these questions may help third-parties benefit consumers by providing them with interesting information, products and services as well as with providing them with targeted advertisements.
- a shipping company creates an application that makes inferences regarding when people are at home.
- the application uses the inferences to schedule deliveries for times when people will most likely be at home.
- the application can also build delivery routes around these scheduled times. This reduces the number of instances where the shipping company has to make multiple attempts to deliver packages, and it reduces the number of times consumers have to pick up their packages from the shipping company.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an abstracted functional view of the extensible devices and services platform 200 of FIG. 2 , with particular reference to the processing engine 206 as well as devices, such as those of the smart-home environment 100 of FIG. 1 .
- devices situated in smart-home environments will have an endless variety of different individual capabilities and limitations, they can all be thought of as sharing common characteristics in that each of them is a data consumer 302 (DC), a data source 304 (DS), a services consumer 306 (SC), and a services source 308 (SS).
- DC data consumer 302
- DS data source 304
- SC services consumer 306
- SS services source 308
- the extensible devices and services platform 200 can also be configured to harness the large amount of data that is flowing out of these devices.
- the extensible devices and services platform 200 can be directed to “repurposing” that data in a variety of automated, extensible, flexible, and/or scalable ways to achieve a variety of useful objectives. These objectives may be predefined or adaptively identified based on, e.g., usage patterns, device efficiency, and/or user input (e.g., requesting specific functionality).
- FIG. 3 shows processing engine 206 as including a number of paradigms 310 .
- Processing engine 206 can include a managed services paradigm 310 a that monitors and manages primary or secondary device functions.
- the device functions can include ensuring proper operation of a device given user inputs, estimating that (e.g., and responding to an instance in which) an intruder is or is attempting to be in a dwelling, detecting a failure of equipment coupled to the device (e.g., a light bulb having burned out), implementing or otherwise responding to energy demand response events, or alerting a user of a current or predicted future event or characteristic.
- Processing engine 206 can further include an advertising/communication paradigm 310 b that estimates characteristics (e.g., demographic information), desires and/or products of interest of a user based on device usage. Services, promotions, products or upgrades can then be offered or automatically provided to the user.
- Processing engine 206 can further include a social paradigm 310 c that uses information from a social network, provides information to a social network (for example, based on device usage), and/or processes data associated with user and/or device interactions with the social network platform. For example, a user's status as reported to their trusted contacts on the social network could be updated to indicate when they are home based on light detection, security system inactivation or device usage detectors. As another example, a user may be able to share device-usage statistics with other users. In yet another example, a user may share HVAC settings that result in low power bills and other users may download the HVAC settings to their smart thermostat 102 to reduce their power bills.
- characteristics e.g., demographic information
- Services, promotions, products or upgrades can then be offered or
- the processing engine 206 can include a challenges/rules/compliance/rewards paradigm 310 d that informs a user of challenges, competitions, rules, compliance regulations and/or rewards and/or that uses operation data to determine whether a challenge has been met, a rule or regulation has been complied with and/or a reward has been earned.
- the challenges, rules or regulations can relate to efforts to conserve energy, to live safely (e.g., reducing exposure to toxins or carcinogens), to conserve money and/or equipment life, to improve health, etc.
- one challenge may involve participants turning down their thermostat by one degree for one week. Those that successfully complete the challenge are rewarded, such as by coupons, virtual currency, status, etc.
- compliance an example involves a rental-property owner making a rule that no renters are permitted to access certain owner's rooms. The devices in the room having occupancy sensors could send updates to the owner when the room is accessed.
- the processing engine 206 can integrate or otherwise utilize extrinsic information 316 from extrinsic sources to improve the functioning of one or more processing paradigms.
- Extrinsic information 316 can be used to interpret data received from a device, to determine a characteristic of the environment near the device (e.g., outside a structure that the device is enclosed in), to determine services or products available to the user, to identify a social network or social-network information, to determine contact information of entities (e.g., public-service entities such as an emergency-response team, the police or a hospital) near the device, etc., to identify statistical or environmental conditions, trends or other information associated with a home or neighborhood, and so forth.
- entities e.g., public-service entities such as an emergency-response team, the police or a hospital
- each bedroom of the smart-home environment 100 can be provided with a smart wall switch 108 , a smart wall plug 110 , and/or smart hazard detectors 104 , all or some of which include an occupancy sensor, wherein the occupancy sensor is also capable of inferring (e.g., by virtue of motion detection, facial recognition, audible sound patterns, etc.) whether the occupant is asleep or awake.
- the remote security/monitoring service or fire department is advised of how many occupants there are in each bedroom, and whether those occupants are still asleep (or immobile) or whether they have properly evacuated the bedroom. While this is, of course, a very advantageous capability accommodated by the described extensible devices and services platform, there can be substantially more “profound” examples that can truly illustrate the potential of a larger “intelligence” that can be made available. By way of perhaps a more “profound” example, the same bedroom occupancy data that is being used for fire safety can also be “repurposed” by the processing engine 206 in the context of a social paradigm of neighborhood child development and education.
- the same bedroom occupancy and motion data discussed in the “ordinary” example can be collected and made available (properly anonymized) for processing in which the sleep patterns of schoolchildren in a particular ZIP code can be identified and tracked.
- Localized variations in the sleeping patterns of the schoolchildren may be identified and correlated, for example, to different nutrition programs in local schools.

For example, based on the presence detection, intelligence components 416 can adjust device settings to, e.g., conserve power when nobody is home or in a particular room or to accord with user preferences (e.g., general at-home preferences or user-specific preferences). As another example, based on the detection of a particular person, animal or object (e.g., a child, pet or lost object), intelligence components 416 can initiate an audio or visual indicator of where the person, animal or object is or can initiate an alarm or security feature if an unrecognized person is detected under certain conditions (e.g., at night or when lights are out).

- intelligence components 416 can initiate an audio or visual indicator of where the person, animal or object is or can initiate an alarm or security feature if an unrecognized person is detected under certain conditions (e.g., at night or when lights are out).
- intelligence components 416 can detect hourly, weekly or even seasonal trends in user settings and adjust settings accordingly. For example, intelligence components 416 can detect that a particular device is turned on every week day at 6:30 am, or that a device setting is gradually adjusted from a high setting to lower settings over the last three hours. Intelligence components 416 can then predict that the device is to be turned on every week day at 6:30 am or that the setting should continue to gradually lower its setting over a longer time period.

- a first device can detect that a user has pulled into a garage (e.g., by detecting motion in the garage, detecting a change in light in the garage or detecting opening of the garage door).
- the first device can transmit this information to a second device, such that the second device can, e.g., adjust a home temperature setting, a light setting, a music setting, and/or a security-alarm setting.
- a first device can detect a user approaching a front door (e.g., by detecting motion or sudden light-pattern changes).
- the first device can, e.g., cause a general audio or visual signal to be presented (e.g., such as sounding of a doorbell) or cause a location-specific audio or visual signal to be presented (e.g., to announce the visitor's presence within a room that a user is occupying).

- Thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 includes computational logic that is operable to predict the thermodynamic behavior of a structure at least in part in response to a desired HVAC control trajectory.
- the thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 may include a variety of computational logic for generating such predictions, such as an HVAC state control simulator 622 and an indoor temperature predictor 624 .
- the HVAC state control simulator 622 is operable to simulate actuation of one or more stages of an HVAC system based on a desired environmental condition (e.g., a desired indoor temperature) and a current environmental condition (e.g., a current indoor temperature). In simulating the actuation of the HVAC stages, HVAC state control simulator 622 may receive information indicative of the desired environmental condition (e.g., the desired indoor temperature), and information indicative of the corresponding current environmental condition (e.g., the current indoor temperature), and apply a set of HVAC stage control logic to determine, and output, information indicative of one or more simulated HVAC actuation states.
- a desired environmental condition e.g., a desired indoor temperature
- a current environmental condition e.g., a current indoor temperature
- HVAC state control simulator 622 may output information indicative of actuation of one or more HVAC heating stages. Similarly, if a desired indoor temperature is lower than the current indoor temperature, then the HVAC state control simulator 622 may output information indicative of actuation of one or more HVAC cooling stages. It should be recognized that embodiments are not limited to these particular examples.
- HVAC systems may include one or more of a variety of stages, a fan stage, first and second heating stages, an emergency heating stage, first and second cooling stages, a humidifier stage, etc., where the stages may be independently (or dependent on one another) actuated.
- the indoor temperature predictor 624 is operable to determine an expected change in the current environmental condition (e.g., a change in the current indoor temperature) in response to the simulated actuation state(s) of the HVAC stage(s). In determining the expected change in the current environmental condition, the indoor temperature predictor 624 may rely on a thermodynamic model of the structure that specifies how the structure will behave, thermodynamically, under the influence of an HVAC control system. In some relatively simple cases only one thermodynamic model of the structure may exist, and thus the indoor temperature predictor 624 may rely on that single model to determine the expected changes in the structure's environmental conditions. In other cases, however, a number of models may exist, in which case the indoor temperature predictor 624 may use the most suitable model.
- an expected change in the current environmental condition e.g., a change in the current indoor temperature
- the indoor temperature predictor 624 may rely on a thermodynamic model of the structure that specifies how the structure will behave, thermodynamically, under the influence of an HVAC control system. In some relatively
- different models may be associated with different HVAC actuation states, such as a model being associated with stage one heating being actuated, a different model being associated with stage one cooling being actuated, and yet a different model being associated with stage one heating and a fan being actuated.
- the most suitable model may thus depend on which HVAC stages are actuated by the HVAC state control simulator 622 and as defined by the information indicative of one or more simulated HVAC actuation states received by the HVAC state control simulator 622 .
- the thermodynamic model(s) may be revised over time so as to, for example, ensure that the applied model accurately reflects the most recent behavioral characteristics of the structure.
- the indoor temperature predictor 624 may also acquire and use a variety of information.
- the indoor temperature predictor 624 may acquire and use information such as an expected outdoor environmental characteristic (e.g., an expected outdoor temperature), an expected structural environmental characteristic (e.g., an expected temperature of the structure), a time that is local to the structure for which the environmental characteristics are being determined, etc.
- an expected outdoor environmental characteristic e.g., an expected outdoor temperature
- an expected structural environmental characteristic e.g., an expected temperature of the structure
- a time that is local to the structure for which the environmental characteristics are being determined etc.
- some or all of such information may be used with the thermodynamic model in determining the expected thermodynamic behavior of the structure.
- the thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 may receive a schedule of setpoint temperatures (T schedule ) as information indicative of a desired environmental condition.
- the schedule T schedule may be implemented as a vector of discrete time-wise elements, where each element is represented by T schedule (k)
- Thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 may sequentially apply the setpoint temperatures defined by the vector T schedule (k) to the HVAC state control simulator 622 .
- the HVAC state control simulator 622 then, in turn for each setpoint temperature, determines an appropriate HVAC actuation state.
- the HVAC actuation states may similarly be implemented as a vector of discrete time-wise elements U(k) (for each HVAC stage), where each element is sequentially output by the HVAC state control simulator 622 in response to input of a corresponding schedule element T schedule (k).
- Each discrete time-wise element U(k) may then be applied to the indoor temperature predictor 624 which, for each element U(k), determines and outputs an expected change in indoor temperature, T in (k+1). For each time increment the expected change in indoor temperature T in (k+1) may be fed back to the HVAC state control simulator 622 so that the HVAC state control simulator 622 may determine the expected indoor temperature for comparison with the input setpoint temperature.
- the discrete HVAC actuation state elements U(k) may be aggregated to generate an expected HVAC actuation control trajectory and the expected changes in indoor temperature T in (k+1) may be aggregated to generate an expected indoor temperature profile.
- Thermodynamic model generator 630 includes computational logic that is operable to identify, and in some cases generate, a thermodynamic model for use by the thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 .
- the thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 may be coupled to or otherwise in communication with the thermodynamic model generator 630 .
- the thermodynamic prediction element 620 may request a thermodynamic model from the thermodynamic model generator 630 .
- the request may simply request a current version of that model.
- the request may include information identifying the actuation state of the HVAC system to assist the thermodynamic model generator 630 in identifying or generating the most suitable model.
- the indoor temperature predictor 624 may acquire a thermodynamic model of the structure for characterizing an environmental characteristic trajectory of the structure.
- the model may be founded upon a preselected, predetermined plurality of basis functions that characterize a contribution of a plurality of basis factors, some of them having direct physical significance and others having only associative mathematical significance on the environmental characteristic trajectory in response to an actuation state of the HVAC system.
- the basis functions may include one or more of a variety of functions that are indicative of, for example, an effect from a given HVAC stage, an effect from a previous cycle, a difference in outdoor and indoor temperature, and an effect caused by factors other than environmental factors.
- such basis functions may include one or more of the following:
- some embodiments may include an HVAC effectiveness term that indicates how effective the HVAC is to condition an enclosure under varying outdoor temperatures.
- an efficient HVAC system may have relatively constant duty cycle lengths to condition an enclosure given a particular indoor/outdoor temperature difference over a wide range of outdoor temperatures
- an inefficient HVAC system may have a (relatively) wide range of duty cycle lengths to condition an enclosure given a particular indoor/outdoor temperature difference over a wide range of outdoor temperatures.
- various basis functions may be used according to different thermodynamic models that would be most appropriate according to various structure types, climates, user preferences, HVAC system types, etc.
- cycle refers to a period during which a particular HVAC actuation state is in effect with respect to the energy-consuming parameters (i.e., actuation stage(s)) of interest for the model being considered.
- the parameter of interest is simply whether the heating is ON or OFF.
- the time that the HVAC is ON and then OFF represents two distinct consecutive cycles.
- the time that heater is on (regardless of fan state), and then the heater is off (regardless of fan state) represents two distinct consecutive cycles.
- the state of the fan does not impact the duration of the cycle since the parameter of interest for the particular model is only concerned with the state of the heater.
- a first type of basis function may be representative of an effect of a previous HVAC cycle.
- the effect of the previous HVAC cycle may dominate the change in the predicted temperature during the initial stages of the current HVAC cycle. This effect will generally decay as the time into the current HVAC cycle increases. This initial interval where the effect of the previous HVAC cycle will dominate the thermodynamic model may be referred to as “early-cycle activity.” During early-cycle activity, most of the temperature change effect will be carried over from the previous HVAC cycle while the HVAC system ramps up in the current cycle. For example, when turning on an air conditioner (i.e., actuating the AC HVAC function) the effect of the prior HVAC cycle will dominate until the air conditioner is able to cool the heat exchange coils, cool the vents, etc., such that the air within the structure will begin to cool.
- the prior HVAC cycle may be in a drift state, where the HVAC system is neither actively heating nor cooling the structure.
- the indoor temperature will tend to drift higher. Therefore, early-cycle activity in this example will see the indoor air temperature continue to drift upwards until the effect of the air conditioner begins to dominate and begin reducing the indoor temperature.
- the early-cycle activity may last for a certain period of time, such as 1 minute, 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, in a range from 1-10 minutes, for less than 1 minute, or for more than 10 minutes.
- a basis function in the thermodynamic model representing this early-cycle activity can be represented by the average temperature change in a time interval that precedes the current HVAC cycle, and may be given by:
- w 1 represents a weight for the basis function
- dT/dt previous cycle represents the final temperature derivate of the previous cycle.
- dT/dt previous cycle may represent the average temperature change over a period of time (such as, for example, the last 1 minute of the previous HVAC cycle, the last 3 minutes of the previous HVAC cycle, the last 5 minutes of the previous HVAC cycle, the last 10 minutes of the previous HVAC cycle, a period less than 1 minute, greater than 10 minutes, or in a range from 1 to 10 minutes).
- t cycle represents the elapsed time since the beginning of the current HVAC cycle.
- other embodiments may use other basis functions to represent the early-cycle activity. For example, some embodiments may use any function that has a maximum at the beginning of the current HVAC cycle that decays over time.
- a second type of basis function may be representative of a primary effect of the HVAC function of the current HVAC cycle.
- the portion of the current HVAC cycle that is dominated by the effect of the current HVAC function may be referred to as “steady-state activity,” or “middle-cycle activity.”
- steady-state activity the effect of the previous HVAC cycle is overcome by the HVAC function of the current cycle.
- the basis function during steady-state activity may be affected by changes in the outdoor temperature, the structure temperature, and/or the time of day.
- the steady-state activity could be characterized by the indoor temperature beginning to drop instead of drifting upwards.
- some embodiments may use a basis function that demonstrates a decay over time.
- some embodiments may use a functional form that describes the decaying effect of the HVAC function over the current HVAC cycle such as:
- t cycle again represents the elapsed time since the beginning of the current HVAC cycle
- p represents a constant based on empirical testing.
- the value of p may be optimized for each structure in which the thermostat is installed.
- the value of p may be optimized over a learning interval, such as the first 10 days after the thermostat is installed in the structure.
- the value of p may be optimized for a class of structures.
- a central thermostat management server may be configured to collect data from a plurality of thermostats, group the data according to common characteristics of the structures or the inhabitants thereof, and generate values of p that can be used in each of these structures.
- the effect of the current HVAC cycle can also be affected by the effectiveness of the HVAC system.
- how effective an HVAC system is at reaching or maintaining a desired setpoint temperature depends on an outdoor temperature and, more specifically, a difference between the outdoor temperature T out and the indoor temperature T in .
- the effectiveness of the HVAC system in maintaining (or changing in accordance with a desired setpoint) the indoor temperature is relatively low as the HVAC system may need to expend significant energy in maintaining the temperature differential and, in some cases, may have insufficient capacity to maintain the indoor temperature.
- FIG. 7 shows graphs 720 , 722 illustrating HVAC effectiveness relative to the difference between T out and T in where T out is the temperature outside of the enclosure and T in is the temperature inside of the enclosure.
- the vertical axis 710 in each graph represents HVAC effectiveness, ⁇ , whereas the horizontal axis 712 in each graph represents the difference between T out and T in .
- graph 720 illustrates the assumed HVAC effectiveness during a cooling cycle; that is, when the thermostat is operating in a cooling mode.
- an air conditioner When an air conditioner is operative, it can generally be assumed that the outdoor temperature T out is higher than the indoor temperature T in during the HVAC cycle.
- the effectiveness of the HVAC system in controlling T in is generally presumed to decrease.
- the effectiveness of the HVAC system in controlling T in is generally presumed to increase.
- Some embodiments may model this relationship linearly as represented by section 704 of graph 720 , which includes caps on the ranges of temperature differentials at which the maximum and minimum HVAC effectiveness is presumed. However, in other embodiments, those caps may be removed such that there are no ‘flat’ portions of the linear representation.
- a non-linear (e.g., exponential) relationship may be presumed.
- graph 722 illustrates HVAC effectiveness during a heating cycle; that is, when the thermostat is operating in a heating mode. Note that the shape of the effectiveness curve is the same, but that the temperature differential is reversed such that it is determined by T in ⁇ T out , which reflects the assumption that the outdoor temperature will typically be lower than the indoor temperature during seasons where the HVAC heating functions are most often used.
- the basis function can include an estimate where the HVAC system is considered to operate at its maximum effectiveness over a certain range of indoor/outdoor temperature differentials, such as less than 1° C., less than 2° C., less than 3° C., less than a temperature differential in a range from 0° C. to 3° C., or greater than 3° C.
- ⁇ max Such a maximum effectiveness may be represented as ⁇ max .
- the basis function can include an estimate where the HVAC system is considered to operate at its minimum effectiveness over a certain range of indoor/outdoor temperature differentials, such as greater than 15° C., greater than 17° C., greater than 20° C., greater than a temperature differential in a range from 15° C. to 20° C., or less than 15° C. or greater than 20° C.
- a minimum effectiveness may be represented as ⁇ min .
- these minimum/maximum boundaries can be applied to increase the robustness of the thermodynamic model in extreme conditions.
- the effectiveness factor can be limited to ⁇ max , and when ⁇ max ⁇ (T out ⁇ T in ) ⁇ 0, the effectiveness factor can be limited to ⁇ min .
- the effectiveness factor can be limited to ⁇ max , and when ⁇ max ⁇ (T in ⁇ T out ) ⁇ 0, the effectiveness factor can be limited to ⁇ min .
- ⁇ max and/or ⁇ min can be predetermined or empirically determined for a structure or a group of structures.
- ⁇ min 0.0 or some other nominal value (e.g., 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, a value in a range from 0.01 to 0.2, a value less than 0.01, or a value greater than 0.2) may be used as an approximation of the minimum effectiveness factor.
- samples of T out ⁇ T in can be recorded during a training interval to identify the actual highest/lowest effectiveness factors seen by the thermostat. The average, mean, mode, and/or other statistical characterizations of the samples of T out ⁇ T in can also be used.
- k may have a different value, such as 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, a value in a range from 1.8 to 10, a value less than 1.8, or a value greater than 10.
- a generalized basis function for the steady-state activity of the current HVAC cycle can be represented by combining the decaying function of equation (2) with the effectiveness factor of equations (4) or (5) to yield
- Equation (6) it will be recognized that as the indoor/outdoor temperature differential decreases, the effectiveness of the HVAC system increases, and as a result the basis function defined by equation (6) plays a larger role in predicting a change in indoor temperature in response to a given HVAC actuation state.
- some embodiments may alternatively or additionally use a piecewise evaluation of basis functions to represent the transition between the early-state activity and the steady-state activity of the current HVAC cycle.
- the time at which this transition between the early-state activity and the steady-state activity takes place may be represented by ⁇ response , which may represent the end of a response interval of the structure to the HVAC system.
- FIG. 8 illustrates a graph of an HVAC response interval correlated with a change in HVAC state, a rate of change of indoor temperature over time, and a change of indoor temperature over time, according to some embodiments.
- Curve 808 represents the HVAC state as a function of time. Prior to time 810 , the air-conditioning function of the HVAC state is off. After time 810 , the air-conditioning function of the HVAC state is on. Note that the air-conditioning function is merely exemplary, and any HVAC state may operate in a similar or more complex manner.
- curve 804 represents the indoor temperature (T in ) of the structure. On a day when (T out ⁇ T in )>0, the temperature inside the enclosure will tend to drift upwards when the air conditioner is off.
- curve 804 is drifting upwards prior to time 810 .
- curve 804 will continue to drift upwards, albeit at a slower rate as the air conditioner ramps up.
- This slower upward drift represents the early-state activity, when the activity of the previous HVAC cycle (i.e., upward temperature drift in the absence of HVAC actuation) will contribute primarily to the change in temperature of the indoor temperature.
- Curve 806 illustrates the rate of temperature change in the enclosure according to the same timescale. For exemplary purposes, the temperature increase prior to time 810 is linear and the rate is constant. After time 810 , the rate begins to fall but remains positive. At time 810 , curve 806 crosses the 0.0 axis, and the rate becomes negative as the temperature begins to fall.
- the interval between time 810 and time 812 may be referred to herein as a response interval 802 .
- Time 812 may be referred to as dead time or response time, identified herein as ⁇ response .
- the response time may be defined as the time it takes for the temperature derivative to cross zero.
- the response time can be programmed as a predetermined value.
- the response time can be determined empirically for a single structure or for group of structures. For example, for a given structure, the response time can be calculated by averaging a set of observed response times during a training interval, possibly following the installation of the thermostat in the structure.
- the response time can be used to separate the evaluation of these two piecewise-continuous functions.
- the combination of these two basis functions can be represented by
- additional basis functions may also be included to model the effect of other thermodynamic characteristics.
- the effect of sunlight on indoor temperature may also be significant in many installations. This can be accounted for using a time of day.
- the time of day may be represented by a periodic diurnal function, such as w 3 ⁇ sin(2 ⁇ mod( t, 1)) (8) where t represents the local time of day and w 3 represents a weight for this basis function.
- the differential between T out and T in may also effect the temperature change in the structure when the HVAC system is not heating or cooling the structure (i.e., the HVAC system is in a “drift” state).
- this differential may be effectively accounted for by the effectiveness term introduced in equations (4) and (5).
- the thermodynamic model may include a basis function representing temperature drift when the HVAC system is not actively heating/cooling. Some embodiments may represent temperature drift simply by w 4 ⁇ ( T out ⁇ T in ) (9) where w 4 represents a weight for this basis function.
- each basis function is weighted, where a specific weighting could be dynamically determined by, e.g., a fitting algorithm (discussed Later).
- a fitting algorithm discussed Later
- some embodiments may use combinations of the basis functions and weights of equations (1), (6), (8), and (9) to generate thermodynamic models for one or more of the HVAC states.
- equation (9) may be implemented by some embodiments as a thermodynamic model of an active HVAC heating/cooling state by combining equations (1), (6), and (8) above as follows:
- each basis function is weighted, where a specific weighting could be dynamically determined by, e.g., a fitting algorithm (discussed later).
- thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 may acquire a variety of information prior to simulating the thermodynamic behavior of the structure. For example, thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 may acquire values for the weighting factors w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , and/or w 4 , from the thermodynamic model generator 630 , an expected outdoor temperature T out i over the prediction time period from a remote entity, and values for the constants p and k. As the thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 progresses through the time-wise sequence of input desired environmental conditions, the predicted indoor temperature at a given time during the prediction period may be used as an input, such as n, for predicting the thermodynamic behavior at a subsequent time in the prediction.
- System 600 in certain embodiments implements thermodynamic behavioral modeling and includes a variety of components such as an HVAC control element 610 , a thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 , and a thermodynamic model generator 630 , according to various embodiments.
- components such as an HVAC control element 610 , a thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 , and a thermodynamic model generator 630 , according to various embodiments.
- FIG. 9 illustrates a thermodynamic model generator 630 according to an embodiment.
- the thermodynamic model generator 630 operates to identify and/or, in some cases generate, a thermodynamic model that characterizes an environmental characteristic trajectory of a structure in response to application of an HVAC actuation state.
- Thermodynamic model generator 630 includes a variety of components, such as input/output logic 932 , a model return controller 934 , a model storage element 936 , and a data acquisition unit 938 coupled to sensor(s) 940 , an HVAC state controller 942 , and a clock 944 .
- the thermodynamic model generator 630 may further include a data storage element 946 , a model fitting unit 948 , and a model parameter storage element 950 .
- model generator 930 can be implemented in hardware, software, or any combination thereof, and while in one embodiment the components of model generator 630 may be implemented in device 400 , other embodiments are not so limited as either some or all of the components may be implemented in electronic devices (e.g., devices associated with smart home environment 100 such as portable electronic device 166 and/or remote server 164 ) other than device 400 .
- Thermodynamic model generator 630 may be operable to identify and/or generate a model in response to a request for a thermodynamic model. Once a model has been identified or otherwise generated, thermodynamic model generator 630 may return the model and/or components thereof. For example, in response to a request for a model communicated from thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 , model generator 630 may identify a thermal model and communicate the thermal model to the prediction element 620 , where the communicated model may include one or more model parameters that characterize the model, such as values for the weighting factors w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , and/or w 4 .
- one or more models may have already been generated at the time the request is received, and in some situations (e.g., if those models are still valid, i.e., generated based on data that was acquired relatively recently with respect to the time of receiving the request, such as within 24 hours) a model that has already been generated may be returned.
- the request may indicate a level of specificity desired for a model. For example, a model may have been generated based on data created when both a stage one and a stage two heater were actuated. The request may indicate that it requires a model that was generated based on data created when both a stage one and stage two heater were actuated, but also a fan was actuated.
- the model generator 630 may search for candidate models that have already been generated and may satisfy the requested level of specificity. If no candidate models are found, then a new model may be generated and returned. If one candidate is found, then that model may be returned. If multiple candidates are found, then the most restrictive model may be returned. In this particular example, the existing model may not be sufficiently specific to satisfy the request, in which case a new model may be generated that is tailored to the request.
- Input/output logic 932 includes logic operable to communicatively interface components of the thermodynamic model generator 630 with other components, such as thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 .

- a plurality of basis functions are identified, where a weighted combination of those basis functions characterize an indoor temperature trajectory of the structure in response to a change in the HVAC actuation state. For example, basis functions indicating the initial rate from a previous cycle, the primary effect from a given stage, the effect of the difference between outdoor temperature and indoor temperature, the effect of the difference between structure temperature and indoor temperature, the effect of the time of day, and a constant representing energy changes not affected by environmental factors may be identified.
- a plurality of weighting factors corresponding to the basis functions may be determined. For example, weighting factors such as the previously described w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , and/or w 4 may be determined by fitting them to the acquired data.

- information indicative of the value of the weighting factors w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , and/or w 4 may be communicated from the thermodynamic model generator 630 to the thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 .
- FIG. 11 provides a particular process for determining a suitable thermodynamic model according to an embodiment. Other sequences of operations may also be performed according to alternative embodiments. For example, alternative embodiments of the present invention may perform the operations outlined above in a different order. Moreover, the individual operations illustrated in FIG. 11 may include multiple sub-operations that may be performed in various sequences as appropriate to the individual operations. Furthermore, additional operations may be added or existing operations removed depending on the particular applications. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize and appreciate many variations, modifications, and alternatives.
- a number of models may be stored in model storage element 936 for use by the thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 of FIG. 6 .
- the model may trained (i.e., generated) and the parameters thereof stored in a model cache such as model storage element 936 . While the models may subsequently be used to satisfy subsequent requests, in some embodiments the models stored in model storage element 936 may become stale after a certain period of time, such as after 24 hours. In some cases, the time period during which a stored model is valid may be correlated with the time period of data used to generate the models. Once a model becomes stale, even if the model may be suitable to satisfy a model request, the model may not be returned but rather a new model may be generated.
- an HVAC system may include a number of stages, such as a fan, stage one heat, stage two heat, etc.
- a request for a thermodynamic model may indicate a desired level of specificity. If a model exists that satisfies the requested criteria, such a model may be returned. Otherwise, a new model specifically tailored to the requested criteria may be generated and returned.
- an HVAC actuation state may be defined by binary settings of the stages, where each stage may have a binary ON state or a binary OFF state.
- Table 1 illustrates an example sequence of HVAC states.
- thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 may make a request such as “Give me a model for the structure which is valid when StageOneHeat is on.”
- a problem with such a request is that there is no data measured when only StageOneHeat is on because the Fan is also always on at the same time.
- the thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 probably doesn't care if the fan is on.
- thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 should specify which switches it cares about in addition to the specific settings of those switches.
- thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 may make a request such as “Give me a model for the structure which is valid when StageOneHeat is on and StageTwoHeat is off and EmergencyHeat is off and I don't care about the settings of any other stages.”
- thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 may specify the set of stages that it cares about in the form of a mask.
- model storage element 636 that was generated from:
- any request for “Give me a model for the structure which is valid when StageOneHeat is on and I care about all the other switches and they must be off” will not be able to use the aforementioned model because it was trained on some data which was taken when the fan was on. A new model would have to be fit against the smaller subset of data.
- any request for “Give me a model for the structure which is valid when StageOneHeat is on and I don't care about the settings of any other switches” will also not be able to reuse this model because the model did not use the data when StageTwoHeat was on.
- the model was not trained on all of the available data and a new model would have to be fit against a larger set of data.
- a model's definition may be expanded during fitting.
- a request for “Give me a model for the structure which is valid when StageOneHeat is on and StageTwoHeat is off but I don't care about Fan or EmergencyHeat” will not be able to reuse the same model because the model was trained on data for which EmergencyHeat was off.
- the thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 doesn't care about the EmergencyHeat setting and so the prefit model isn't general enough.
- the model fitting unit 948 could have noticed that there was no data when the EmergencyHeat was on.
- the model fitting unit 948 can change the request on the fly from “EmergencyHeat must be off” to “I don't care about EmergencyHeat” without changing the model parameters.
- the more general model can be reused for the 2nd request, above.
- the same validation may be made again to ensure there isn't any data with EmergencyHeat on creeping into the model used by the thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 for the instance it specified it only wants data when EmergencyHeat is off.
- a model's definition may be restricted during fitting. Similar to the above example, assume a request had been made for a model “when StageOneHeat is on and I don't care about Humidification.” During fitting, the model fitting unit 648 may notice that although the request didn't care about humidification, in fact, humidification was always off. If the fitting algorithm makes note of that fact in the model, then a second subsequent request for “when StageOneHeat is on and Humidification must be off” could reuse the same model.
- a model may keep track of various bits independently for each HVAC stage as illustrates in Table 2.
- the MaskEither bit is an input into the fitting algorithm, where the model request may specify this as the mask parameter.
- the Both bit is an output from the model fitting unit 648 after model fitting is complete, and may be set to reflect the data which was chosen to fit the model.
- FIG. 12 illustrates a process for determining a suitable thermodynamic model according to another embodiment.
- the process is described with reference to FIGS. 6-11 , although it should be understood that embodiments of the process are not limited to the exemplary systems and apparatus described with reference to FIGS. 6-11 .
- the process may be implemented as operation 1006 .
- embodiments are not so limited, as the process(es) described herein could be implemented in operations other than operation 1006 .
- thermodynamic model generator 630 may receive such a request from thermodynamic prediction element 620 .
- the request may indicate a desired level of specificity for a returned model.
- the request may include a mask indicating which HVAC stages it would like the model to be tailored to, and the actuation state of each of those stages.
- model return controller 934 may search the model storage element 936 for one or more models that satisfy the request. Such models may satisfy the request if they have the desired level of specificity or an acceptable level of generality.
- thermodynamic model may be generated, for example, by model fitting unit 948 , as discussed with reference to operations 1006 B through 1006 D. Further, the new thermodynamic model may be generated based on the level of specificity indicated in the request.
- processing may continue to operation 1006 EE where it is determined whether the new model may be generalized or restricted.
- the new model may be generalized, or expanded, if it is determined that the data used to generate the model having the requested level of specificity may also satisfy a model request indicating a less restrictive level of specificity.
- the new model may be restricted, or narrowed, if it is determined that the data used to generate the model having the requested level of specificity may also satisfy a model request indicating a more restrictive level of specificity.
- processing may continue to operation 1006 FF where the new model is generalized or restricted.
- information indicating the different levels of specificity for which the model applies may be associated with the model and stored in model storage element 936 .
- thermodynamic model generator 630 may return the new model to thermodynamic behavior prediction element 620 .
- processing may continue to operation 1006 HH where it is determined whether there are a plurality of candidate models. If there is only one model, then in operation 1006 II that model may be returned. Otherwise, processing may continue to operation 1006 JJ where one of the candidate models is returned. In some embodiments, the most restrictive model may be returned.

Other sequences of operations may also be performed according to alternative embodiments. For example, alternative embodiments of the present invention may perform the operations outlined above in a different order. Moreover, the individual operations illustrated in FIG. 12 may include multiple sub-operations that may be performed in various sequences as appropriate to the individual operations. Furthermore, additional operations may be added or existing operations removed depending on the particular applications. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize and appreciate many variations, modifications, and alternatives.
- FIG. 13 illustrates a flowchart of a method of determining a thermodynamic model of an enclosure associated with an HVAC system, according to some embodiments.
- the method may include receiving temperature information for a period of time during which the HVAC system operates in a first state ( 1302 ).
- the temperature information may be received for a number of time periods during which the HVAC system operates in the first state, where those number of time periods represent a history of thermodynamic responses of the enclosure to actuation of the HVAC system.
- the temperature information can define the temperature trajectory of the enclosure during the period(s) of time. From this history of temperature trajectories, future probabilistic trajectories in response to similar stimuli (i.e., HVAC actuations) may be determined.
- the first state of the HVAC system may be any of the HVAC actuation states described herein, such as heating, cooling, first stage heating, second stage heating, fan activation, radiant flooring, dehumidification, humidification, and/or the like.
- the first HVAC state may also include times when the HVAC system is inactive and temperature within the enclosure is allowed to drift.
- the temperature information may comprise a vector of temperature values observed by a temperature sensor of the thermostat during the period(s) of time.
- the period(s) of time can comprise a learning period after installation of the thermostat. Alternatively or additionally, the learning period may comprise a previous interval during which the HVAC system operated in the first state.
- the temperature information may include time-ordered vector temperature measurements observed when the HVAC system was previously actively heating/cooling the enclosure.
- the temperature information can also include information for multiple previous time periods. This temperature information may be averaged together to generate an average temperature trajectory profile for the enclosure when the HVAC system is operating in the first state. In some cases, future temperature trajectory projections resulting from similar HVAC actuations may be determined by curve fitting to the previously measured temperature trajectories.
- the method may also include determining a response interval ( 1304 ).
- the response interval may represent an estimated time between when the HVAC system begins operating in the first state and when the temperature within the enclosure begins to change in a direction associated with the first state.
- the response interval may indicate the estimated time between when the HVAC system begins heating the enclosure and when the temperature within the enclosure begins to rise in response to the heating function.
- the response interval may indicate the estimated time between when the HVAC system begins cooling the enclosure and when the temperature within the enclosure begins to decrease in response to the cooling function.
- the response interval may be empirically determined based on previous HVAC cycles.
- the data used for the empirical determination can be specific to the particular enclosure, or may be generated by a central thermostat management system and based on data from a plurality of thermostats in similar enclosures.
- the response interval may be specific to each HVAC operating state.
- the first operating state may be associated with a first response interval
- a second HVAC state where, e.g., the HVAC system has actuated both a heating stage and a fan stage
- the enclosure may respond faster to air conditioning than it does to heating.
- the method may additionally include determining a plurality of weighting factors corresponding to a respective plurality of predetermined basis functions ( 1306 ).
- any of the basis functions described herein may be used to form a thermodynamic model for each individual HVAC actuation state.
- the weighted combination of basis functions can characterize the temperature trajectory of the enclosure in response to the HVAC system operating in any particular state.
- the model fitting operations described above can be used to determine the weights for each of the basis functions.
- a first basis function can represent the effect of a previous HVAC cycle on the current HVAC cycle.
- a second basis function can represent the effect of the current HVAC function on the current HVAC cycle.
- the first basis function can be evaluated from a time that the HVAC system begins operating in the first state until a time when the response interval ends. This may be referred to (as described above) as the early-state activity.
- the second basis function can be evaluated beginning at the time when the response interval ends. Evaluation of the second basis function may continue until the end of the current HVAC cycle, or until the temperature differential between indoor and outdoor temperatures is such that the effectiveness of the HVAC system crosses a minimum threshold.
- other basis functions may be used in addition to or in the place of the two basis functions described above.
- Some embodiments may use a third basis function that represents the diurnal effect of sunlight on the enclosure. This third basis function can be evaluated during the response interval as well as after the response interval.
- a fourth basis function may represent the temperature differential between indoor and outdoor temperatures, and may be part of a thermodynamic model when the HVAC system is in a drift state.
- FIG. 14 illustrates a flowchart of a method for characterizing the enclosure and/or the HVAC system based on properties of the thermodynamic model.
- the method may include receiving data based on the fitted thermodynamic model ( 1402 ).
- This data may be received by a local processing unit on a smart home control device, such as a thermostat or a local computer system.
- This data may also be received by a central monitoring system, such as a thermostat management server that collects data from a number of different smart home devices in different enclosures.
- This data may be transmitted through a local private network, such as a home Wi-Fi network, through a router connected to a public network such as the Internet, and received remotely by the central monitoring system.
- the data from the fitted thermodynamic model may comprise the calculated weights for each of a plurality of basis functions and/or an effectiveness factor determined for the enclosure as previously described.
- the data may include a history of the calculated weights, and/or an indication of changes to the weights over time.
- the absolute value of the weights may be indicative of enclosure and/or HVAC system characteristics of interest, such as whether an HVAC system is particularly inefficient (compared to a standard benchmark of HVAC system effectiveness, compared to other HVAC systems and corresponding enclosures within a community/geographical region/etc., or compared to other suitable reference points). It should be recognized that while the ‘effectiveness factor’ described herein is described as a factor indicative of an HVAC system's ability to satisfy setpoint temperatures given a difference in outdoor and indoor temperature, the effectiveness factor may also be tied to an HVAC cycle time.
- the time required for the HVAC system to reconcile a given difference in setpoint temperature and indoor temperature may vary significantly over a range of outdoor temperatures.
- the HVAC system having a low ‘effectiveness’ may require 5 minutes to perform the required heating when the outdoor temperature is relatively warm but may require 50 minutes to perform the required heating when the outdoor temperature is relatively cold. Or, in an extreme case, may never be capable of driving the enclosure to the setpoint° C. when the outdoor temperature is relatively cold.
- an ‘effective’ HVAC system may exhibit a low variation in duty cycle across various differences in setpoint temperatures and indoor temperatures regardless of an outdoor temperature
- an ‘ineffective’ HVCA system may exhibit a high variation in duty cycle across various differences in setpoint temperatures and indoor temperatures regardless of an outdoor temperature.
- an ‘overly effective’ i.e., too much capacity for a given enclosure
- the acquisition and comparison of effectiveness benchmarks with particular HVAC system efficiencies may be performed by a particular thermostat or, in some cases, performed by a remote server such as the central server or cloud-computing system 164 .
- changes to the weights and/or effectiveness factor for a given enclosure over time may be indicative of changes to characteristics of interest of the enclosure and/or associated HVAC system.
- an effectiveness factor that depreciates over time may be indicative of wear and tear of the HVAC system itself (e.g., air filters) or other properties of the enclosure (e.g., window sealants).
- Such changes may be recorded and monitored by any suitable device, such as a particular thermostat used to environmentally condition the enclosure or a remote server such as the central server or cloud-computing system 164 .
- the method may also include characterizing aspects of the enclosure and/or the HVAC system based on the received data ( 1404 ).
- the received data can be used to characterize many different aspects of the enclosure and/or HVAC system. More specifically, in some embodiments, data can be used to determine the effectiveness or strength of an HVAC system. For example, a large value for w 2 in equation (6) above may indicate a more powerful or more efficient HVAC system, while a relatively small value for w 2 may indicate an underpowered or inefficient HVAC system. This can be used to diagnose whether an HVAC system is operating in an efficient manner, or whether the HVAC system is properly sized for the enclosure.
- an effectiveness factor as defined in, e.g., equation (5) may indicate whether a particular HVAC system is efficient, where a large value for ⁇ may indicate an efficient HVAC system and a small value for ⁇ may indicate an inefficient HVAC system.
- a large value for w 3 and/or w 4 may indicate that the enclosure is insufficiently insulated as heat rapidly moves into or out of the enclosure during HVAC drift cycles.
- other values can also be used to diagnose a characteristic of the enclosure and/or HVAC system. For example, a large response time may indicate that the enclosure has overly long HVAC ducts, or that the HVAC system is in a particularly hot/cold part of the enclosure.
- the data based on the fitted thermodynamic model for a single enclosure may be compared to other enclosures by a central thermostat monitoring system. For example, basis function weights, response times, and/or temperature trajectory profiles may be compared to other similar enclosures. Determinations can be made based on these comparisons about how a particular HVAC system is performing relative to its peers. Similarly, determinations can be made based on these comparisons about how a particular enclosure responds to its HVAC systems relative to its peers.
- any characterizations made about the HVAC system and/or the enclosure can be relayed to a customer or other party of interest, such as a sales/service company.
- a thermostat can display an indication on a user interface describing problems that may be of interest to a customer, such as “your air conditioner seems too small for your home,” or “your home seems to heat less quickly than before—have you checked your air filter recently?”
- Some embodiments may also offer services that can remedy these problems, such as insulation installation service, air-conditioner replacement service, and/or the like. These embodiments may even automate contact between the customer and the service provider to initiate a new installation, upgrade/service the HVAC system, etc.

- thermodynamic behavioral modeling of structures In many modern systems, including systems such include HVAC systems which manage the environmental characteristics in a structure, it is desirable to predict the thermodynamic behavior of a structure.

Abstract
Description
-
- (a) a function representative of an effect of the previous HVAC cycle that lasts until an initiated HVAC cycle begins to take effect (e.g., when a temperature change switches direction due to the initiated HVAC cycle);
- (b) a function representative of a primary effect of the initiated HVAC function of the current HVAC cycle that begins when the initiated HVAC cycle begins to take effect (e.g., when a temperature change switches direction due to the initiated HVAC cycle);
- (c) a function representative of the effect of the difference between the outdoor temperature and the indoor temperature; and/or
- (d) a function representative of the effect of the local time of day that approximates the effect of sunlight.
where tcycle again represents the elapsed time since the beginning of the current HVAC cycle, and p represents a constant based on empirical testing. In some embodiments, p=0.2 has been shown to yield favorable results, but is not so limited. For example, other values of p may include p=0.01, p=0.5, p=0.75, p=1, 0.01<p<1, p≦0.01, and p≧1. In some embodiments, the value of p may be optimized for each structure in which the thermostat is installed. For example, the value of p may be optimized over a learning interval, such as the first 10 days after the thermostat is installed in the structure. In some embodiments, the value of p may be optimized for a class of structures. For example, a central thermostat management server may be configured to collect data from a plurality of thermostats, group the data according to common characteristics of the structures or the inhabitants thereof, and generate values of p that can be used in each of these structures.
σmax =k·(T out −T in)max training (3)
where (Tout−Tin)max training represents the maximum temperature differential observed during a training interval, and k represents a constant, such as k=1.8. Notably, k may have a different value, such as 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, a value in a range from 1.8 to 10, a value less than 1.8, or a value greater than 10.
σ=max(σmax−max(T out −T in,0),σmin) (4)
σ=max(σmax−max(T in −T out,0),σmin) (5)
where w2 represents a weight for this basis function. From equation (6), it will be recognized that as the indoor/outdoor temperature differential decreases, the effectiveness of the HVAC system increases, and as a result the basis function defined by equation (6) plays a larger role in predicting a change in indoor temperature in response to a given HVAC actuation state.
w 3·sin(2π·mod(t,1)) (8)
where t represents the local time of day and w3 represents a weight for this basis function.
w 4·(T out −T in) (9)
where w4 represents a weight for this basis function.
ΔT=f(τresponse ,t cycle ,T out ,T in ,dT/dt previous cycle ,t,U) (10)
where ΔT=Tn+1−Tn, Tn represents the indoor temperature at a current timestep, and Tn+1 represents the indoor temperature at a subsequent time step.
For modeling the drift state in absence of active HVAC heating/cooling, the w4·(Tout−Tin) weight and basis function of equation (9) may be added to the weights and basis functions of equation (11), and the effectiveness factor may be assumed to be equal to 1, resulting in
