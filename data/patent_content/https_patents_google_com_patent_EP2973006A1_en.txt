Definitions
- This specification relates to identifying resources responsive to a search query.
- Search systems index resources, e.g., social network updates, microblog posts, blog posts, news feeds, user generated multimedia content, images, videos, and web pages, and present information about the indexed resources to a user in response to receipt of a particular search query.
- social network updates e.g., social network updates, microblog posts, blog posts, news feeds, user generated multimedia content, images, videos, and web pages.
- An entity is a person, place, thing or concept.
- a resource that includes image content of an entity can be associated with an entity tag that uniquely identifies that entity.
- the search system can return to the user device a results page that includes user interface (UI) element data that, when processed by the user device, causes the user device to display a UI element that is labeled with the name of the entity.
- UI user interface
- the UI element is selectable by a user operating the user device to initiate a search for other resources that are associated with the entity.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of maintaining an index for a collection of resources, where each resource in the collection is associated with zero or more respective entity tags, and where each entity tag includes a respective entity name, receiving a search query from a user device, identifying a plurality of resources in the collection that satisfy the search query using the index, where each identified resource includes respective image content, upon determining that the search query satisfies one or more descriptive query criteria, processing each entity tag that is associated with a respective identified resource as a current entity tag, including determining whether or not a user interface (UI) element that is representative of the current entity tag is to be displayed on the user device, and if so, generating UI element data that, when processed by the user device, causes the user device to display a UI element that is labeled with the entity name in the current entity tag and is selectable by a user operating the user device to initiate a search for resources that are associated with an entity that is identified by the entity name in the current entity
- inventions of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.
- a system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to perform the actions.
- One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- the method can further include determining that the search query satisfies the one or more descriptive query criteria based on a result of one or more of the following: determining that the search query includes more than a first threshold number of distinct nouns that are hypernyms, determining that the search query includes more than a different, second threshold number of distinct adjectives, and determining that the plurality of resources is associated with more than a different, third threshold number of distinct entity tags.
- the method of determining whether or not the UI element that is representative of the current entity tag is to be displayed on the user device can include determining whether or not the current entity tag is the only entity tag that is associated with the respective identified resource, and if so, generating the UI element data that is representative of the current entity tag.
- the method of determining whether or not the UI element that is representative of the current entity tag is to be displayed on the user device can include determining whether or not entity tags identical to the current entity tag are associated with less than a threshold percentage of the identified resources, and if so, generating the UI element data that is representative of the current entity tag.
- Each resource in the collection is associated with zero or more respective keyword tags.
- Each keyword tag includes a respective keyword.
- the method can further include processing each keyword tag that is associated with a respective identified resource as a current keyword tag, including determining whether or not the keyword included in the current keyword tag is an entity name, and if so, generating an entity tag that includes the keyword, and associating the entity tag with the identified resource that is associated with the current keyword tag.
- the method can further include processing a first resource, determining, based on a result of the processing, that image content in the first resource includes a visual representation of a particular entity, generating an entity tag that include an entity name that identifies the particular entity, and associating the entity tag with the first resource.
- the method of processing the first resource can include processing text content in the first resource to identify one or more keywords, and determining that at least one of the keywords is an entity name.
- the method of processing the first resource can include processing metadata associated with the first resource to identify one or more keywords, and determining that at least one of the keywords is an entity name.
- the method of processing the first resource can include determining that features of the image content in the first resource match features of image content in a different, second resource, where the second resource is associated with an entity tag that identifies the particular entity.
- a user can submit a descriptive search query that does not identify an entity by name and leverage information stored in an entity database to initiate an entity-specific search and/or search refinement.
- FIG. 1 shows an example search system that can receive search queries from and present search results to a user device.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of an example process to generate a search results page.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example web page of image search results.
- FIG. 1 shows an example search system 100 that can receive search queries from and present search results to a user device 102.
- the user device 102 can be any digital device used by a user to access the search system 100, for example, a mobile phone or a personal computer connected to a network 104, for example, the Internet.
- the search system 100 includes a search engine 106 configured to search a collection of resources and identify specific resources that satisfy the search queries.
- the search system 100 can communicate with multiple resource hosts 108a . . . 108n, each of which stores multiple resources within the collection of resources, over the network 104.
- a resource is a digital resource that can be individually addressed, for example, using a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
- a resource can include content in any format, for example, text, image, audio, video, or combinations of them.
- a resource can also be associated with keyword tags.
- a keyword tag is a tag that includes a keyword that describes the content that is included in the resource.
- a resource that includes image content of a breed of dog known as a "Chesapeake Bay Retriever” can be associated with keyword tags that include one or more of the following user-specified keywords: “brown,” “sedge,” “dead grass,” “tan,” “light brown,” “dark brown,” “wooly undercoat,” “thick overcoat,” “short overcoat,” “muscular,” “swimmer,” “dog,” and “Chesapeake Bay Retriever.”
- the search system 100 includes a crawler 110 that crawls resources stored in the resource hosts 108a . . . 108n and stores information about each resource in a search index 1 12.
- the information that is stored in the search index 1 12 can be derived from keyword tags and metadata associated with the resources and text content in the resources.
- the search system 100 also includes an entity database 1 14, which is a repository of information pertaining to distinct entities, for example, people, places, things, or concepts.
- entity database 1 14 is a repository of information pertaining to distinct entities, for example, people, places, things, or concepts.
- an entity is a thing, specifically, a breed of dog known as a "Chesapeake Bay retriever”
- the entity database 114 includes information about the entity, for example, entity name: "Chesapeake Bay Retriever,” place of origin: "United States of America,” breed: “dog,” breed group: “sporting,” and color: "brown, sedge, dead grass, light brown, dark brown, tan.”
- the entity database 1 14 also stores associations between entities that have a hypernym-hyponym relationship.
- a hyponym of a given term is a more specific term in the same domain, while a hypernym is a more general term.
- “dog” is a hypernym of "Chesapeake Bay Retriever”
- "dragon fruit” is a hyponym of "fruit.”
- Hypernym-hyponym relationships can be determined, for example, by analyzing text corpora to identify certain syntactic patterns representative of a hypernym hyponym pair, or by consulting predefined lists of hyponyms and hypernyms.
- the search system 100 also includes an entity recognition engine 116 that recognizes entities in resources that are stored on the resource hosts 108a . . . 108n.
- the entity recognition engine 1 16 implements a keyword processing technique that can determine whether any keyword included in a keyword tag that is associated with a particular resource matches an entity name in the entity database 1 14. If the entity recognition engine 116 finds a match, the entity recognition engine 1 16 generates an entity tag that includes the entity name and stores information in the entity database 1 14 that associates the entity tag with the particular resource.
- the entity recognition engine 116 uses conventional computer vision techniques to determine whether features of image content in a resource match those of a resource that is associated with an entity tag.
- the entity recognition engine 1 16 finds a match, the entity recognition engine 1 16 stores information in the entity database 114 that associates the entity tag with both of the resources.
- the entity recognition engine 1 16 processes text, e.g., metadata that is associated with the resource or text content that is included in the resource, to identify one or more keywords, then performs the keyword processing technique described above to associate the resource with one or more entity tags.
- Each of the search engine 106, crawler 110, and entity recognition engine 1 16 is implemented in the system 120 as one or more software modules running on one or more computers in one or more locations.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of an example process to generate a search results page. Implementation of the process can occur in a data processing system using computer software that performs the operations of the process, for example, a system like search system 100.
- the search system 100 receives a search query from a user device 102 (202).
- the search query includes the following text string: "wooly undercoat swimming brown dog" with an indication that search results returned must include images.
- the search system 100 identifies resources in the collection of resources that satisfy the search query (204). Each identified resource includes image content. Each identified resource is associated with zero or more entity tags.
- the search system 100 determines whether or not the search query is a descriptive search query (206). In one implementation, the search system 100 makes this determination by evaluating the search query according to one or more descriptive query criteria. In one example, the search system 100 identifies the search query as descriptive if the search query includes more than a threshold number of distinct nouns that are hypernyms. In another example, the search system 100 identifies the search query as descriptive if the search query includes more than a threshold number of adjectives. In another example, the search system 100 identifies a search query as descriptive if more than a threshold number of distinct entity tags are associated with the resources identified as satisfying the search query. The search system 100 can use additional or different criteria to determine whether a particular search query is descriptive.
- search system 100 determines that the search query is not a descriptive search query, the search system 100 uses conventional techniques to generate a search results page that, when processed by the user device 102, displays summaries of content from the identified resources (208).
- a summary of content from an identified resource includes the image content included in the identified resource and a link to the resource itself.
- the search system 100 determines that the search query is descriptive, the search system 100 generates a search results page that includes summaries of content from the identified resources and user interface elements that a user operating the user device 102 selects in order to initiate entity-specific searches (210).
- the search system 100 processes each entity tag associated with an identified resource as a current entity tag in order to determine whether or not a user interface (UI) element representative of the current entity tag is to display on the user device 102 in conjunction with the image content of the associated identified resource.
- UI user interface
- the search system 100 generates UI element data that is representative of the current entity tag if the current entity tag is the only entity tag that is associated with a particular identified resource.
- the search system 100 identifies a resource associated with a single entity tag that includes a text string of "Chesapeake Bay retriever" as satisfying the "wooly undercoat swimming brown dog" search query.
- the search system 100 generates UI element data that, when processed by the user device 102, causes a UI element, labeled with "Chesapeake Bay retriever" to display. A user operating the user device 102 may select this UI element to initiate a search that is specific to the entity identified by the name of "Chesapeake Bay retriever.”
- the search system 100 generates UI element data that is representative of the current entity tag if entity tags identical to the current entity tag are associated with less than a threshold percentage of the identified resources.
- the search system 100 identifies 3000 resources as satisfying the "wooly undercoat swimming brown dog" search query, of which 2900 are associated with the entity tag that includes a text string of "dog" and of those 2900 resources, 500 are further associated with an entity tag that includes a text string of "Chesapeake Bay retriever.” If the threshold percentage is set at 20%, the search system 100 does not generate UI element data that is representative of a current entity tag of "dog” but does generate UI element data that is representative of a current entity tag of "Chesapeake Bay retriever.” In addition, if 50 of those 500 resources are further associated with an entity tag that includes a text string of "Alaskan Malamute," the search system 100 can generate UI element data that causes a UI element labeled with "Also in
- the search system 100 In a third example in which an identified resource is associated with two or more entity tags that share a subordinate/ dominant relationship, the search system 100 generates UI element data only for the subordinate entity tag. For example, an identified resource is associated with multiple entity tags, of which one includes a text string of "dog” and another includes a text string of "Chesapeake Bay retriever.” Information in the entity database 114 indicates that the entity of "Chesapeake Bay retriever" is subordinate to the entity of "dog.” In the above example, when the search system 100 processes the entity tags of "dog" and "Chesapeake Bay retriever," the search system 100 generates UI element data that causes a UI element labeled with "Chesapeake Bay retriever" to display but does not cause a UI element labeled with "dog” to display when the user device 102 processes the UI element data.
- the search system 100 generates UI element data that is representative of the current entity tag if less than a threshold number of entity tags are associated with the particular identified resource. If, for example, the threshold number is set at four, then for identified resources associated with one, two, or three entity tags, the search system 100 generates UI element data that causes a respective UI element to display for each of the entity tags associated with the particular identified resource when the user device 102 processes the UI element data.
- the search system 100 can use a tag diversity technique to select a predefined number of entity tags of each entity type, for which corresponding UI element data is generated. For example, an identified resource is associated with a first entity tag that includes a text string of "Chesapeake Bay Retriever,” a second entity tag that includes a text string of "Cypress tree,” a third entity tag that includes a text string of "Point Lobos,” a fourth entity tag that includes a text string of "Carmel Bay,” and a fifth entity tag that includes a text string of "Monterrey Peninsula.”
- the search system 100 examines the information in the entity database 1 14 for these five tags and determines that the first two entity tags represent things and the remaining three entity tags represent places.
- the search system 100 generates UI element data that causes a UI element labeled "Chesapeake Bay Retriever” and a UI element labeled "Point Lobos” to display when the user device 102 processes the UI element data.
- the search system 100 transmits the search results page to the user device 104
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example web page 300 of image search results.
- the web page 300 includes a query of "wooly undercoat swimming brown dog" entered into a search text field 302 and image search results 304, 306, 308 that satisfy the query.
- the UI element 306, labeled with "Chesapeake Bay retriever” can be displayed to a user, for example, when the user hovers a cursor over the image search result 308. The user can select this UI element 318 to initiate a search that is specific to the entity identified by the name of "Chesapeake Bay retriever.”
