- some items shown separately in FIG. 3 could be implemented on single servers and single items could be implemented by one or more servers.
- the actual numbers of servers used to implement a messaging server and how features are allocated among them will vary from one implementation to another, and may depend in part on the amount of data traffic that the system must handle during peak usage periods as well as during average usage periods.
- Emails are already stored at servers as part of its normal operation.
- Chat messages may be stored as servers as well. Indeed, chat messages may be stored, and optionally indexed, in a manner that is similar to the storage of email messages. Because chat messages can be stored in a manner similar to email messages, they can also be associated with email message conversions and displayed along with email messages in the conversation.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of a process for displaying an integrated conversation view of messages that includes email messages and chat messages, in accordance with some embodiments.
- a conversation includes one or more relevant messages covering a conversation topic, and all the senders and recipients of the messages are participants of the conversation. In some other embodiments, other criteria may be used to determine which messages are part of the conversation.
- Process flow 400 described a process for displaying the messages in a conversation, where the messages include both email messages and chat messages.
- One or more email messages in a conversation are received by a messaging system from a first client ( 402 ).
- the messaging system also archives the email messages.
- the email messages are delivered to a second client ( 404 ).
- the second client receives the messages from the messaging server ( 406 ).
- a user at the second client may compose one or more email messages in the same conversation as the received messages.
- the user at the second client may reply to one or the email messages in the conversation.
- the user at the second client also replies to one of the email messages in the conversation with a chat message.
- the user can reply by chat only if the user at the firs client (the sender of the email messages) is online.
- the reply chat message is sent to the messaging system ( 408 ).
- the messaging system receives the reply chat message ( 410 ).
- the chat message initiates a chat session, which may include further chat messages sent by the user at the second client and may also include chat messages sent by the user at the first client.
- the messaging system archives all or part of the chat session and associates the chat session with the conversation.
- the messaging system sends to the second client a representation of the conversation that includes the email messages and the chat message(s) ( 412 ).
- the second client receives the representation ( 414 ).
- the representation of the conversation is displayed ( 416 ).
- the representation includes the email messages and chat messages displayed in the same window.
- the user can also reply to an archived chat message or an archived chat session by email.
- the reply email and the archived chat message/session may be displayed together as a conversation, similar to the displaying of emails and chat messages in a conversation as described above.
- a conversation window 800 displays the messages in a conversation, including both email messages and chat messages.
- the conversation window 800 includes a plurality of panels 802 , 804 , 806 , and 808 .
- the panels include panels fore email messages 802 , 804 , 808 and a panel for chat sessions 806 .
- the conversation window 800 may include as many email message panels and as many chat session panels as needed to display the email messages and chat sessions in the conversation.
- the panels are arranged n chronological order and may show the dates of the message(s) and the sender of the message(s).
- the panels also include inks (or buttons) for replying to or forwarding a particular message.
- a text field 812 for entering a reply is included in one or more of the panels 802 , 804 , 808 that show email messages.
- a link 810 (or button) to reply to the email message via chat is also included.
- the link to reply by chat allows the user to reply to the message with near-real time chat messages to the sender of the message, rather than sending a non-real time email message.
- the link 810 to reply by chat is available only for the most recent message in the conversation.
- FIGS. 5A and 5B are flow diagrams of processes for displaying a timeline view of chat messages, in accordance with some embodiments.
- Chat messages of a chat session if archived, may be displayed as a transcript of sorts.
- the transcript may be displayed in a timeline style, with messages in one display area, timestamps of the messages in a second display area, and the messages are aligned with their respective timestamps.
- a plurality of chat messages in a chat session are received by and sent from a first client ( 502 ).
- a user at the first client may send one or more chat messages of a chat session to a second client.
- the first client also may receive one or more chat messages of the same chat session from the second client.
- the messages may be archived by a messaging system, and the first (or second) client may request a display of the archived messages.
- the received and sent chat messages are displayed in a first display region of a window ( 504 ).
- timestamps for at least a subset of the messages are displayed ( 506 ).
- the second display region is adjacent, but does not overlap the firs display region. Timestamps need not be displayed for all of the chat messages in the chat session.
- the time units of the displayed timestamps are hours and minutes but not seconds. In such case, one timestamp may be shown for messages that occur within the same minute. In other embodiments, a single timestamp is shown for messages that occur with the same two-minute period, or for messages that occur within the same five-minute period.
- Time gaps (or breaks) between consecutive messages in the session that are more than a predefined amount are identified ( 508 ).
- the time gaps may be identified by comparing the timestamps of the messages.
- graphical objects that indicate the time gap are displayed in the window ( 510 ).
- An example of a graphical object that may be displayed is a line that runs across both first and second display regions.
- the graphical object also includes an indication of the time elapsed during the respective time gap.
- FIG. 5B An alternative embodiment of the process for displaying a timeline view of chat messages is shown in FIG. 5B .
- process flow 520 a plurality of chat messages in a chat session are received by and sent from a first client ( 502 ).
- the chat messages are display in a first display region ( 504 ).
- Timestamps for at least a subset of the chat messages are displayed in a second display region ( 506 ).
- a time gap threshold is determined ( 522 ).
- the time gap threshold is based on the timestamp differences (the time gaps) for respective pairs of consecutive messages in the chat session. In a chat session of x messages, there are a total of x ⁇ 1 time gaps between pairs consecutive messages. The time gap threshold is determined based on these time gaps.
- M is the arithmetic mean of the x ⁇ 1 timestamp differences in the chat session. For example, if a chat session has 6 messages and timestamp differences of 1, 4, 10, 27, and 37 minutes, then M is 15.8 minutes, which may be rounded to 16 minutes in some embodiments. In some other embodiments, M is the median of the x ⁇ 1 timestamp differences in the chat session. For example, if a chat session has 6 messages and timestamp differences of 1, 4, 10, 27, and 37 minutes, then M is 10 minutes.
- Time gaps (or breaks) between consecutive messages in the session that are both more than a predefined amount and more than T are identified ( 524 ).
- the predefined amount is 5 minutes.
- the predefined amount serves to separate out the potentially “significant” time gaps from those that are very short an trivial, and T separates the “significant” time gaps from the “not as significant” time gaps.
- “significant” time gaps are those time gaps that are greater than the mean or median time gap by at least a factor ⁇ .
- the time gaps may be identified by comparing the timestamps of the messages. For the identified time gaps, graphical objects that indicate the time gap are displayed in the window ( 510 ).
- the timeline view improves readability of chat transcripts by separating the timestamps from the messages. Furthermore, the timeline view reduces information clutter in chat transcripts by omitting some of the timestamps from display, and by confining the displayed timestamps to a different region than the region in which the chat messages are displayed.
- events that take place in the same year if the year is the basic unit in the timeline
- messages that occur in the same minute if the minute is the basic unit in the chat transcript timeline, or in the same N-minute time period when the basic time unit in the chat transcript timeline is N-minutes
- the displaying of graphical objects for time gaps may be limited to the “significant” breaks in the chat session.
- the window 900 showing the transcript of a chat session includes a first display region 904 for displaying the messages and a second display region 902 for displaying the timestamps of the chat messages.
- the messages are aligned with their respective timestamps.
- the timestamps are displayed in hours and minutes, omitting the seconds.
- the timestamp display region 902 display separate timestamps for less than all of the message in the message display region 904 ; a timestamp of a respective message is omitted from display if the respective message has the same timestamp (i.e. falls within the same basic time unit) as another, earlier message.
- Chat session breaks 906 -A and 906 -B corresponding to periods of no messaging activity having a duration longer than a predefined amount of time, are shown with break lines.
- the “predefined amount of time,” which can also be called the break time threshold is five minutes.
- the chat session breaks 906 -A, 906 -B also indicate the amount of time elapsed during the breaks. For example, the break 906 -A indicates a 30-minute break in messaging activity, and break 906 -B indicates a 6-minute in messaging activity.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of a process for restricting archiving of chat messages, in accordance with some embodiments.
- Process flow 600 describes a process whereby participant users in a chat session may control the archiving of particular messages in the chat session.
- a first set of chat messages are exchanged in a chat session between a first user and a second user ( 602 ).
- a first user at the first client sends chat messages to a second user at a second client, and vice versa.
- the first client also receives chat messages originating from the second client, and vice verso.
- the messages are sent to the recipient clients via the messaging system; a message is sent by the sender client to the messaging system, and the messaging system delivers the message to the recipient client.
- the first set of chat messages in the chat session are archived by the messaging system ( 604 ). At least one copy of each message in the first set is stored in a repository. In some embodiments, two copies of each of the messages in the first set are stored in the repository, one each for both accounts of the first user and the second user. In some other embodiments, one copy of each of the messages is stored in the repository, but the copy is associated with the accounts of both the first user and the second user.
- the chat messages may be stored as separate documents containing the individual messages or in one documents containing all messages from the chat session.
- a command to stop archiving the chat session is received by the messaging system ( 606 ).
- the command may be sent by either the first user or the second user. More generally, the command to stop archiving may be sent by any of the plurality of participant users in a chat session. In some embodiments, when any participant user in a chat session commands the messaging system to stop archiving the chat session, subsequent messages of the chat session are not archived at all for all participant users of the chat session.
- subsequent messages of the chat session are not archived only for the participant user who made the instruction to stop archiving (i.e., the requesting user's subsequent messages are not archived, but the messages of others continued to be archived (unless those users have also made stop-archiving requests)).
- a second set of chat messages are exchanged in the session between the first and second users ( 608 ).
- the second set of messages is not archived by the messaging system, in accordance with the received command to stop archiving the chat session.
- the second set of messages is archived for neither the first user nor the second user.
- the requesting user's messages in the second set are not archived but other user's messages in the second set continued to be archived, unless those users have also made stop-archiving request.
- a command to resume (or start) archiving of the chat session is received by the messaging system ( 610 ).
- the command may be sent by either the first user or the second user.
- the command applies to all participant users in the chat session; archiving is resumed for all participants of the chat session, for whom archiving were stopped by a previous command to stop archiving.
- either participant may issue the command to stop archiving or to resume archiving at any given moment, and the command applies to both participants.
- archiving is resumed only for the chat session participant that made the command to resume archiving. Other chat session participants for whom archiving may have been stopped by a command to stop archiving are not affected.
- a third set of chat messages are exchanged in the session between the first and second users ( 612 ).
- the third set of messages is archived by the messaging system, in accordance with the command to resume archiving ( 614 ).
- the command to resume archiving affects only messages subsequent to the command; messages preceding the command that are not archived are not restored into the repository.
- the first or the second user can toggle the archiving as desired, similar to the toggling (commands to stop/resume archiving) described above.
- chat session controls the archiving of a chat session, or more particularly, controlling the archiving of particular messages in the chat session, users participating in a chat session an make parts of the chat session “off the record” as desired.
- chat session started with archiving active.
- a chat session may start with the archiving off and the user who desires to have the chat session archived must make the command to start archiving in order to activate the archiving.
- FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating a chat window with control over archiving of chat messages, in accordance with some embodiments.
- the participants is a chat session may be provided an option to allow or restrict archiving of chat messages in the chat session.
- a toggle 1004 for controlling the archiving of messages in the session may be provided within the chat window 1000 .
- the toggle 1004 (shown in FIG. 10 as a checkbox) allows a user to turn archiving on or off for subsequent messages.
- the archiving toggle may be located in another location in the chat window, such as an options menu 1002 .
- a message will be displayed in the message panel 1006 alerting the user that archiving has been deactivated and that subsequent messages will no be archived. If the user activates archiving, then messages subsequent to the activation are archived until archiving is deactivated. In some embodiments, a message will be displayed in the message panel 1006 alerting the user that archiving has been activated and that subsequent messages will be archived.
- the default setting for archiving when a new chat session is started is that archiving is active. Thus, if a user wants to keep any of the messages in the session “off the record,” he needs to deactivate the archiving; the user has to opt out of the archiving. In some other embodiments, the default is that archiving is off; a user that wants to have chat messages archived has to opt into the archiving by making the command to activate it.
- the disclosed embodiments are also applicable to a chat session with more than two participants, such as chat rooms and multi-user chat session may, at any moment, issue the command to stop or resume archiving, and the command is applicable to all of the participants in the chat room or the multi-user chat session.
- FIGS. 7A and 7B are flow diagrams of a process for searching a contact list, in accordance with some embodiments.
- Process flow 700 describes a process where a contact list search query may be made and the search is performed on all contact information fields, not just on the names of contacts. Furthermore, search results are displayed in real-time or near-real time as the search string is entered, akin to Autocomplete; typing an additional character into a query string may change the search results that are displayed.
- a subset of a contact list of a user is displayed ( 702 ).
- the contact list may be displayed in the window of a chat application.
- the subset of the contact list that is displayed may be the contacts that had most recently sent the user a message.
- the contacts that are displayed are the contacts with whom the user has sent and received the most messages.
- a score may be associated with each contact in a user's contact list, and contacts having the highest scores may be selected as the subset of contacts to be displayed.
- a contact list search box is displayed as well ( 704 ), into which a user may type in a query. The contact list may be searched for contacts that match the query without requiring the user to initiate the search (e.g., no click or other action is required to initiate the search).
- a query string typed into the search box by the user is received ( 706 ).
- a first set of contacts, each of which having at least one contact information field that satisfies the query string, is identified ( 708 ).
- the identification (search using the query string) is performed over the entire list of contacts, not just the subset of contacts that is displayed in block 702 .
- a contact information field satisfies the query string if the string is a substring of a term that is included in the contact information field. For example, the query string “joh” is satisfied by the terms “Johannes,” “Mikeljohn” and “Mike@johnson.com.”
- the first set of contact that have contact information satisfying the query string is displayed in the chat application window ( 710 ).
- a contact information field satisfies the query string if the string matches the beginning portion of the contact information field or any predefined subfield of the contact information field.
- the query string “joh” is satisfied by the terms “Johannes,” “Mike Johnson” and “Mike@johnson.com,” because in each of these examples the string “joh” is found at the beginning portion of the term or a predefined subfield of the term.
- An additional character to the query string is received ( 712 ).
- the additional character is typed into the search box and appended to the query string.
- the query string and the additional character from a new query string.
- a second set of contact, each of which having at least one contact information field that satisfies the new query string, is identified ( 714 ).
- the identification search using that query string) is performed over the entire list of contacts, not just the subset of contacts that is displayed in block 702 .
- a contact information field satisfies the new query string if the new string is a substring of a term that is included in the contact information field.
- the query string “john” is satisfied by the term “Mikeljohn” but not “Johannes.”
- a contact information field satisfies the query string if the sting matches the beginning portion of the contact information field or any predetermined subfield of the contact information field.
- the second set of contacts that satisfy the new search string may be different from the first set of contacts that satisfy the original search string.
- the second set of contacts that satisfy the new query string is displayed in the window ( 716 )
- the identification of the first and second sets of contacts are responsive to the receipt of the query strings, and do not require the user to explicitly initiate a search.
- This is mode of operation may be called an “autocomplete” methodology or mode of operation, because the search and identification functions are performed automatically upon entry of a query string.
- a selection of one of the second set of contacts is received ( 718 ).
- the contact profile for the selected contact is displayed, along with the edit field for the contact information fields in the contact profile ( 720 ).
- the set of contact information fields that are searched by the Autocomplete contact list search feature include fields other than name, handle (e.g., IM username) and email fields.
- the set of contact information fields that are searched may include one or more of the following: (A) a field, or subfield, that stores the domain portion of a contact's email address (enabling searches for contacts having domain names that match the search query); (B) one or more telephone number fields (e.g., enabling searches for contacts having telephone numbers with a particular area code); (C) one or more physical address fields, such as address fields that store street, city, state and/or postal address information (e.g., enabling searches for contacts located in a particular city, state or country, or having an address on a particular street); (D) other fields that store supplemental information, such as business names, names of associates or other people related to the contact, or miscellaneous information (e.g., enabling searches for contacts who work at a particular business, or who are closely associated with another contact, e
