- ⁇ олователи generate and access a large number of articles, such as emails, web pages, word processing documents, spreadsheet documents, instant messenger messages, and presentation documents, using a client device, such as a personal computer, personal digital assistant, or mobile phone.
- Some articles are stored on one or more storage devices coupled to, accessible by, or otherwise associated with the client device(s). Users sometimes wish to search the storage device(s) for articles.
- client-device search applications may significantly degrade the performance of the client device.
- certain conventional client-device search applications typically use batch processing to index all articles, which can result in noticeably slower performance of the client device during the batch processing.
- batch processing occurs only periodically. Therefore, when a user performs a search, the most recent articles are sometimes not included in the results.
- the index of articles associated with the client device can become outdated.
- Conventional client-device search applications can also need to rebuild the index at each batch processing or build new partial indexes and perform a merge operation that can use a lot of client-device resources.
- Conventional client-device search applications also sometimes use a great deal of system resources when operational, resulting in slower performance of the client device.
- client-device search applications can require an explicit search query from a user to generate results, and may be limited to examining file names or the contents of a particular application's files.
- Embodiments of the present invention comprise methods and systems for processing contact information.

- the user's 112 a interaction with articles, the client applications 120 , and the client device 102 a creates event data that may be observed, recorded, analyzed or otherwise used.
- An event can be any occurrence possible associated with an article, client application 120 , or client device 102 a , such as inputting text in an article, displaying an article on a display device, sending an article, receiving an article, manipulating an input device, opening an article, saving an article, printing an article, closing an article, opening a client application program, closing a client application program, idle time, processor load, disk access, memory usage, bringing a client application program to the foreground, changing visual display details of the application (such as resizing or minimizing) and any other suitable occurrence associated with an article, a client application program, or the client device whatsoever.
- event data can be generated when the client device 102 a interacts with an article independent of the user 112 a , such as when receiving an email or performing a scheduled task.
- the memory 108 of the client device 102 a can also contain a capture processor 124 , a queue 126 , and a search engine 122 .
- the client device 102 a can also contain or is in communication with a data store 140 .
- the capture processor 124 can capture events and pass them to the queue 126 .
- the queue 126 can pass the captured events to the search engine 122 or the search engine 122 can retrieve new events from the queue 126 .
- the queue 126 notifies the search engine 122 when a new event arrives in the queue 126 and the search engine 122 retrieves the event (or events) from the queue 126 when the search engine 122 is ready to process the event (or events).
- the search engine When the search engine receives an event it can be processed and can be stored in the data store 140 .
- the search engine 122 can receive an explicit query from the user 112 a or generate an implicit query and it can retrieve information from the data store 140 in response to the query.
- the queue is located in the search engine 122 .
- the client device 102 a does not have a queue and the events are passed from the capture processor 124 directly to the search engine 122 .
- the event data is transferred using an information exchange protocol.
- the information exchange protocol can comprise, for example, any suitable rule or convention facilitating data exchange, and can include, for example, any one of the following communication mechanisms: Extensible Markup Language—Remote Procedure Calling protocol (XML/RPC), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), shared memory, sockets, local or remote procedure calling, or any other suitable information exchange mechanism.
- XML/RPC Extensible Markup Language—Remote Procedure Calling protocol
- HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- SOAP Simple Object Access Protocol
- shared memory sockets, local or remote procedure calling, or any other suitable information exchange mechanism.
- the capture processor 124 can capture an event by identifying and compiling event data associated with an event. Examples of events include sending or receiving an email message, a user viewing a web page, saving a word processing document, printing a spreadsheet document, inputting text to compose or edit an email, opening a presentation application, closing an instant messenger application, entering a keystroke, moving the mouse, and hovering the mouse over a hyperlink.
- An example of event data captured by the capture processor 124 for an event involving the receipt of an email message by the user 112 a can comprise the sender of the message, the recipients of the message, the time and date the message was received, and the content of the message.
- the capture processor 124 comprises multiple capture components.
- the capture processor 124 shown in FIG. 1 comprises a separate capture component for each client application in order to capture events associated with each application.
- the capture processor 124 can also comprises a separate capture component that monitors overall network activity in order to capture event data associated with network activity, such as the receipt or sending of an instant messenger message.
- the capture processor 124 shown in FIG. 1 also can comprise a separate client device capture component that monitors overall client device performance data, such as processor load, idle time, disk access, the client applications in use, and the amount of memory available.
- 1 also comprises a separate capture component to monitor and capture keystrokes input by the user and a separate capture component to monitor and capture items, such as text, displayed on a display device associated with the client device 102 a .
- An individual capture component can monitor multiple client applications and multiple capture components can monitor different aspects of a single client application.
- the capture processor 124 can monitor activity on the client device and can capture events by a generalized event definition and registration mechanism, such as an event schema.
- Each capture component can define its own event schema or can use a predefined one.
- Event schemas can differ depending on the client application or activity the capture component is monitoring.
- the event schema can describe the format for an event, for example, by providing fields for event data associated with the event (such as the time of the event) and fields related to any associated article (such as the title) as well as the content of any associated article (such as the document body).
- An event schema can describe the format for any suitable event data that relates to an event.
- an event schema for an instant messenger message event sent by the user 112 a can include a recipient or list of recipients, the time sent, the date sent, content of the message, and a conversation ID.
- An event schema for a web page currently being viewed by a user can include the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the web page, the time being viewed, and the content of the web page.
- An event schema for a word processing document being saved by a user can include the title of the document, the time saved, the format of the document, the text of the document, and the location of the document. More generally, an event schema can describe the state of the system around the time of the event. For example, an event schema can contain a URL for a web page event associated with a previous web page that the user navigated from. In addition, event schema can describe fields with more complicated structure like lists. For example, an event schema can contain fields that list multiple recipients. An event schema can also contain optional fields so that an application can include additional event data if desired.
- the capture processor 124 can capture events occurring presently (or “real-time events”) and can capture events that have occurred in the past (or “historical events”).
- Real-time events can be “indexable” or “non-indexable”.
- the search engine 122 indexes indexable real-time events, but does not index non-indexable real-time events.
- the search engine 122 may determine whether to index an event based on the importance of the event. The importance may be measured by a capture score associated with and/or determined for the event.
- Indexable real-time events can be more important events associated with an article, such as viewing a web page, loading or saving a file, and receiving or sending an instant message or email.
- Non-indexable events can be deemed not important enough by the search engine 122 to index and store the event, such as moving the mouse or selecting a portion of text in an article.
- Non-indexable events can be used by the search engine 122 to update the current user state. While all real-time events can relate to what the user is currently doing (or the current user state), indexable real-time events can be indexed and stored in the data store 140 . Alternatively, the search engine 122 can index all real-time events.
- Real-time events can include, for example, sending or receiving an article, such as an instant messenger message, examining a portion of an article, such as selecting a portion of text or moving a mouse over a portion of a web page, changing an article, such as typing a word in an email or pasting a sentence in a word processing document, closing an article, such as closing an instant messenger window or changing an email message being viewed, loading, saving, opening, or viewing an article, such as a word processing document, web page, or email, listening to or saving an MP3 file or other audio/video file, or updating the metadata of an article, such as book marking a web page, printing a presentation document, deleting a word processing document, or moving a spreadsheet document.
- an article such as an instant messenger message
- examining a portion of an article such as selecting a portion of text or moving a mouse over a portion of a web page
- changing an article such as typing a word in an email or pasting a sentence in a word processing document
- closing an article such as
- Historical events are similar to indexable real-time events except that the event occurred before the installation of the search engine 122 or was otherwise not captured, because, for example, the search engine 122 was not operational for a period of time while the client device 102 a was operational or because no capture component existed for a specific type of historical event at the time the event took place.
- Examples of historical events include the user's saved word processing documents, media files, presentation documents, calendar entries, and spreadsheet documents, the emails in a user's inbox, and the web pages bookmarked by the user.
- the capture processor 124 can capture historical events by periodically crawling the memory 108 and any associated data storage device for events not previously captured by the capture processor 124 .
- the capture processor 124 can also capture historical events by requesting certain client applications, such as a web browser or an email application, to retrieve articles and other associated information. For example, the capture processor 124 can request that the web browser application obtain all viewed web pages by the user or request that the email application obtain all email messages associated with the user. These articles may not currently exist in memory 108 or on a storage device of the client device 102 a . For example, the email application may have to retrieve emails from a server device. In one embodiment, the search engine 122 indexes historical events.
- events captured by the capture processor 124 are sent to the queue 126 in the format described by an event schema.
- the capture processor 124 can also send performance data to the queue 126 .
- Examples of performance data include current processor load, average processor load over a predetermined period of time, idle time, disk access, the client applications in use, and the amount of memory available.
- Performance data can also be provided by specific performance monitoring components, some of which may be part of the search engine 122 , for example.
- the performance data in the queue 126 can be retrieved by the search engine 122 and the capture components of the capture processor 124 .
- capture components can retrieve the performance data to alter how many events are sent to the queue 126 , how detailed the events are that are sent (fewer or smaller events when the system is busy), or how frequently events are sent (events are sent less often when the system is busy or there are already too many events waiting to be processed).
- the search engine 122 can use performance data to determine when it indexes various events and when and how often it issues implicit queries.
- events captured by the capture processor 124 are sent to the queue 126 in the format described by an event schema.

- the index queue can queue indexable events, for example.
- the queue 126 can have additional queues or comprise a single queue.
- the queue 126 can be implemented as a circular priority queue using memory mapped files.
- the queue can be a multiple-priority queue where higher priority events are served before lower priority events, and other components may be able to specify the type of events they are interested in.
- real-time events can be given higher priority than historical events, and indexable events can be given higher priority than non-indexable real-time events.
- Other implementations of the queue 126 are possible.
- the client device 102 a does not have a queue 126 .
- events are passed directly from the capture processor 124 to the search engine 122 .
- events can be transferred between the capture components and the search engine using suitable information exchange mechanisms such as: Extensible Markup Language—Remote Procedure Calling protocol (XML/RPC), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), shared memory, sockets, local or remote procedure calling, or any other suitable information exchange mechanism.

- identifying contact information can further comprise determining one or more of a field, header tag, context in which text appears, matching entries, or parsed article content.
- a method can further comprise causing the output of contact information in connection with one or more of a pop-up window, possible alternative contact information, a probability of correct contact information, a link, search results, or an event.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary method 200 that provides a method for capturing and processing an event.
- This exemplary method is provided by way of example, as it will be appreciated from the foregoing description of exemplary embodiments there are a variety of ways to carry out methods in other embodiments of the present invention.
- the method 200 shown in FIG. 2 can be executed or otherwise performed by any of various systems.
- the method 200 is described below as carried out by the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 by way of example, and various elements of the system 100 are referenced in explaining the example method of FIG. 2 .
- the capture processor 124 captures an event.
- the event can be a real-time event or can be a historical event.
- the capture processor 124 can capture a real-time event by identifying and compiling event data associated with the event upon the occurrence of the event.
- the capture processor 124 can capture a historical event, for example, by periodically crawling the memory 108 or associated data storage device of the client device 112 a for previously uncaptured articles or receiving articles or data from client applications and identifying and compiling event data associated with the event.
- the capture processor 124 may have separate capture components for each client application, network monitoring, performance data capture, keystroke capture, and display capture.
- the capture component can use a generalized event definition mechanism, such as an event schema that it has previously defined and registered with the client device 102 a , to capture or express the event.
- the capture processor 124 can compile event data for the event.
- event data compiled for an email event can include the sender, other recipients, the time sent, the date sent, and the content of the message.
- Event data compiled for a web page currently being viewed by a user can include the Uniform Resource Locator or URL of the web page, the time being viewed, and the content of the web page.
- Event data compiled for a word processing document being saved by a user can include the title of the document, the time saved, the location of the document, the format of the document, the text of the document, and the location of the document.
- the capture processor 124 determines whether the event captured is an indexable event.
- some real-time events may not be indexed (non-indexable real-time events).
- non-indexable real-time events are used to update the current user state and are, for example, examining a portion of an article, changing an article, and closing an article.
- non-indexable events are not indexed or sent for storage by the indexer 130 .
- Indexable events can be indexable real-time events or historical events. For example, receiving an email, saving a word processing document, viewing a web page can all be indexable events.
- the event can be sent by the capture processor 124 to the queue 126 with an indication that it is an indexable event.
- indexable real-time events are sent to both a user state queue and an index queue within queue 126 and historical events are sent to the index queue within the queue 126 .
- indexable real-time events may not be sent to the user state queue to save computational time.
- the capture processor 124 can send the event in a form described by an event schema to the queue 126 . If the event is determined to be a non-indexable event, then, in 206 , the non-indexable event can be sent by the capture processor 124 to the user state queue of the queue 126 with an indication that it is not to be indexed.
- the queue 126 holds the event until the search engine is ready to receive it. Based on the event data, the event can be prioritized on the queue 126 for handling. For example, historical events are given a lower priority for processing by the queue 126 than real-time events.
- the indexer 130 when the indexer 130 is ready to process another event, it can retrieve an event or events from the index queue in the queue 126 .
- the query system 132 can retrieve an event or events from the user state queue of the queue 126 , when it is ready to update the user state.
- a queue is not used and events are sent directly to the search engine 122 from the capture processor 124 .
- the indexer 130 indexes and stores the event.
- the indexer 130 can retrieve an event from the queue 126 when it is ready to process the event.
- the indexer 130 determines if the event is a duplicate event and if not assigns an Event ID to the event.
- the indexer 130 can also associate the event with related events.
- the indexer determines indexable terms associated with the event, dates and times associated with the event, and other event data compiled for the event based on the event schema.
- the indexer 130 can associate the Event ID with the indexable terms that are contained in the index 142 .
- the event can be stored in the database 144 and the content of the event can be stored in the repository 146 .
- FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary method 208 for indexing and storing contact information associated with an event.
- the indexer 130 retrieves an event from the queue 126 .
- an entity relating to the event can be identified.
- the indexer 130 can parse out indexable terms from the event and identify entity names from the indexable terms.
- An entity name can represent an entity such as a person, organization, business, or corporation.
- the indexer can identify entity names by comparing the indexed terms from the event with a list of known entity names.
- the list of known entity names can be compiled based in part on the user's past interaction or activity associated with the entities and can be stored in the repository 146 . Other signals can be used to identify entity names.
- an email address or name associated with an email address can be identified.
- a word processing document such as a letter or memorandum
- text in the first line of the address field or to field can be assumed to be an entity name.
- Other signals such as capitalized words, can be used to identify entity names.
- the indexer 130 can scan web pages for address fields, access address listings such as, for example an address book on the client 102 a , determine the URL of a website and compare the URL to a list of known address book URLs, or match other text in an article for known entries in a contact list and append to the existing contact.
- the indexer 130 can further recognize street addresses, zip codes, phone numbers, etc. based on their format and typical values.
- the indexer can recognize that numbers of the form ###-###-#### typically represent phone numbers within the United States. Additionally, the indexer 130 can determine contact information by determining parsed article content on the network 106 . For example, the indexer 130 can determine passed article content on a web page by parsing encoded contact information appearing in special formats such as, for example, a vCard.
- the indexer 130 assigns an entity ID to each identified entity name.
- the indexer 130 can assign a predetermined entity ID to the entity name, if the entity name has been identified previously.
- the indexer 130 can assign a new entity ID to the entity name, if the entity name has not previously been identified.
- contact information associated with the entity name can be determined.
- the indexer 130 can determine from the parsed terms of the event whether any contact information for the entity is associated with the event.
- Contact information can include email address, instant messenger address, telephone number, physical address, URL, and any other suitable contact information.
- Contact information can be determined based on the location of the data in the article associated with the event and/or the structure of the data. For example, for an email event, an email address can be compiled in the to, from or copy field of an email event based on the associated event schema and can thus be identified as an email address. If the field in which the email address was identified also includes an entity name, then the email address and entity name can be associated.
- the body of the email contains a ten digit number, then this number can be identified as a telephone number and associated with the identified entity name. Additionally, if the body of the email contains a signature portion containing an entity name and contact information, this contact information can be associated with the entity name. Similarly, in a word processing document, such as a letter, the address field can be identified and associated with an entity name from the first line of the address field.
- the indexer 130 can determine contact information and/or associate the contact information with an entity based on common identifiers.
- Common identifiers can comprise, for example, matching pieces of contact information appearing in different articles.
- the pieces of contact information can be matched based on a shared value.
- events can contain only partial contact information.
- Event A for example, may contain an email address for a person or entity along with additional contact information such as, for example, a street address, phone number, etc.
- event B may contain only the email address for the person or entity.
- the additional contact information (street address, phone number, etc.) identified from event A can be displayed along with the email address for event B.
- missing contact information in event B can be filled in from event A, based on a match of the email address.
- Other fields may be used to determine a match, such as a phone number, address, zip code, or other suitable information.
- the indexer 130 can group contact information for a person or entity identified by determining common identifiers based, for example, on multiple events.
- event A may contain an email address for person X along with a phone number for person X
- event B may contain an email address for person X and a street address for person X.
- the indexer 130 can use the common identifier of the email address, for example, to associate both the phone number and street address with the email address and the person X.
- the indexer 130 can display the email address, the street address, and the phone number in response to requests for events A or B.
- any event containing the email address, street address, or phone number obtained from any source may be associated with related events.
- the indexer 130 is able to identify more comprehensive contact information by using common identifiers to combine information obtained from multiple events.
- the indexer 130 can determine contact information from multiple events when one or more of the multiple events does not contain a same common identifier.
- event A may contain an email address and phone number for person X
- event B may contain a phone number and fax number for person X
- event C may contain a fax number and street address for person X.
- no single common identifier, or piece of contact information is contained in all of events A, B, and C.
- the indexer 130 can match the phone number from events A and B, which links the email address and fax number with the phone number, and the indexer 130 can match the fax number from events B and C, which can then be linked with the email address and phone number, thus matching all information by identifying common shared identifiers (phone number and fax number in this case) in the groups.
- the indexer 130 can determine contact information and/or associate contact information with an entity by determining context in which text appears. For example, the indexer 130 can identify words and numbers comprising an address by identifying, for example, that the words “shipping address,” appear immediately to the left of the words and numbers. Of course many other examples of identifying context are possible within the scope of various embodiments. Additionally, the indexer 130 can determine contact information and/or associate contact information with an entity by determining header tags or HTML content. For example, a web pages can be an Inbox for an Internet mail service such as, for example, Yahoo MailTM, and can be identified based in part on header tags within the web page. Header tags can comprise, for example, a From: and CC: field.
- the fields can be determined, for example, by parsing the HTML, or using formats such as an “ ⁇ email>” tag to identify particular types of information.
- the indexer 130 can determine contact information and/or associate the contact information with an entity based on redundant identifiers. Redundant identifiers can comprise, for example, same or similar pieces of contact information occurring multiple times in different articles. Redundant identifiers may be used to increase the certainty that a piece of contact information is associated with a correct entity. For example, an single event can contain both an email address and a phone number. The email address and phone number may belong to the same person, or they may not.
- the event may have contained text such as “You can contact person X at (212) 111 1111, and you can contact person Y at y@website.com”
- the indexer 130 can identify that person X is associated with the phone number and person Y is associated with the email address, for example by determining that the names and pieces of contact information are close to each other in the text. In other situations, another method for determining correct contact information for an entity may be used.
- an event can contain text such as “You can contact person X at (212) 111 1111, person Y at y@website.com”.
- the phone number is associated with person X and the email address is associated with person Y.
- the indexer 130 can use patterns to analyze the text to identify which entities relate to which pieces of contact information. Patterns can comprise, for example, common schemes for representing contact information and entity names. For example, in the text above, a pattern “entity X at Y” can be used to identify that X is associated with Y. Common location patterns for contact information can also be used to identify related items with high reliability. For example, a common location of a signature section of an email address often has contact information where a name, phone number, etc. are one after the other.
- the indexer 130 can further determine contact information and/or associate the contact information with an entity based on redundant identifiers by determining multiple occurrences. For example, one event may contain text which could initially incorrectly lead the indexer 130 to determine person Y is associated with a certain phone number, as in the example above where the person Y appears adjacent to the phone number. According to some embodiments, the indexer 130 can determine other events containing an identifier for person Y to verify the contact information. The indexer 130 can determine a probability of correct contact information. A probability of correct contact information can represent the likelihood that the contact information is correctly associated with the entity and can be based, for example, on the co-occurrence and proximity of contact information with the identifier for person Y in the other events.
- eight events may contain the text “person Y, phone (212) 222 2222, fax (212) 222 2223” while two other events contain the text above. Based on the larger number of events containing person Y next to (212) 222 2222, the indexer 130 can conclude that this is the most likely phone number for person Y.
- the indexer 130 can access a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol server (LDAP) to determine contact information for an identified entity.
- LDAP Lightweight Directory Access Protocol server
- the user can be an employee of an organization that has an LDAP containing contact information for employees of the organization.
- the indexer 130 can access the LDAP and determine contact information relating to the entity.
- the indexer 130 can determine contact information and/or associate the contact information with an entity by performing a search on a search engine application to obtain additional contact information. For example, given one or more pieces of contact information, a search can be conducted at a web site containing a database of contact information, which can return additional contact information. Additionally, web searches and web crawling may also be used to identify associated contact information. For example, given an email address, the indexer 130 may automatically search web search engines for the email address, or may crawl web sites for the email address, and identify additional contact information that is located near the email address. Information located near the email address may not be associated with the same entity, in which case the indexer 130 can analyze the frequency and/or proximity of occurrence of contact information near the email address. For example, the most commonly occurring phone number within 10 words of the email address. Phone numbers occurring closer to the email address may be given higher weight.
- the contact information can be indexed.
- contact information associated with an entity name can be associated with the corresponding entity ID in a contact index.
- the contact index can be stored in the index 142 .
- the contact index can contain entity names and corresponding entity IDs.
- the contact information is indexed when the entity name is associated with the user. For example, based on past activity of the user, the indexer 130 can determine if the identified entity is associated with or known to the user. In another embodiment, the indexer 130 can provide notification to the user of the identified entity name and contact information and request authorization from the user to index the contact information.
- the contact information is stored.
- the contact information can be stored in the database 144 .
- the contact information can be stored according to a contact schema.
- the contact schema can allow contact information to be associated with particular types of contact information.
- the contact schema can include email address, instant messenger address, physical address, URL, and telephone number for an entity.
- the contact information can be associated with the entity name by association with the corresponding entity ID.
- the indexing and storing of contact information associated with entity names can allow later retrieval of this information.
- the query system 132 can identify the contact information stored in the database 144 .
- the identified contact information can be returned in a result set in response to the query.
- contact information can be shown on regular search results or associated with events, i.e. the user does not need to explicitly search for contact information.
- search results may contain an email, and other identified contact information can be displayed along with the email result (address, phone number, etc.).
- the user 112 a can select a search result and the display system then shows event details such as the email content and header information.
- the display system may show contact information identified as related to the email addresses/names in the To/From/CC: sections of the email.
- the most likely contact information for people or other entities may be displayed also.
- multiple possible contact information may be displayed.
- the system might display an event containing an identifier for person Y along with information that person Y's phone number is most likely to be (212) 222 2222, but may also be (212) 111 1111.
- Each possible contact information may have an associated probability or confidence score indicating how confident the system is that the information is correct.
- the contact information may not be shown alongside search results or event information, but rather may be make available via links.
- each identified entity in an event may contain a link to the contact information for that entity. This contact information may also be displayed in a popup or “tooltip” window, when the user moves the mouse over the identifier of the entity.
- the environment shown reflects a client-side search engine architecture embodiment. Other embodiments are possible, such as a stand alone client device or a network search engine.
