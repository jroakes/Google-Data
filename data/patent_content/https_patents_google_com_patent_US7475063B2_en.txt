- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of a process that rewrites a query.
- FIG. 4 is an illustration of a synonyms map.
- FIGS. 5A , 5 B, and 5 C and 6 - 34 illustrate groups of conversion maps.
- FIG. 35 is a block diagram of a search engine.
- a process 100 creates a synonyms map from a corpus of documents.
- the documents can be HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents, PDF (Portable Document Format) documents, text documents, word processing documents (e.g., Microsoft® Word documents), Usenet articles, or any other kinds of documents having text content, including metadata content.
- the process 100 can also be applied to other kinds of text-searchable resources, e.g., media resources identified by metadata.
- the synonyms map contains common-form words as keys, each of which is associated with one or more variants. For example, consider a simple corpus in which only two languages are found: French and English. If “elephant” is a common-form entry in the synonyms map, then the variants “elephant”, “eursphant” and “eléphant” would be associated with that entry as values, if these variants are found in the corpus. Each value also includes additional information: the languages of the documents in which instances of the variant appear, and the number of times the variant appears in that language. Continuing the example, “eléphant” might be found in the corpus 90 times among documents recognized as being English and 300 times among documents recognized as being French.
- Process 100 operates on a training corpus of documents (step 110 ).
- the training corpus of documents is ideally a collection of documents representative of documents contained in a search corpus.
- the training corpus and the search corpus can be the same, or the training corpus can be a snapshot of, or an extract from, the search corpus.
- the training corpus should contain documents from all languages represented in the search corpus.
- the training corpus should contain a sufficient number of documents in each language so that the documents contain a significant portion of the words found within all documents of the language in the search corpus.
- each document in the training and search corpus is encoded in a known and consistent character encoding, such as 8-bit Uniform Transformation Format (UTF-8), which can encode any character in the Unicode standard (i.e., most known characters and ideographs).
- UTF-8 Uniform Transformation Format
- Documents that are in an inconsistent or unknown encoding are subject to encoding conversion.
- the corpus is a collection of documents from the Web found by a web crawler.
- the language of each document in the training corpus is identified. Determining the language of each document can be explicitly part of process 100 (step 120 ). Alternatively the document's language can be part of the information contained in the training corpus.
- the language of a document or word does not necessarily correspond simply to natural languages.
- a language can include any distinguishable linguistic system defined by its orthography, syntax, lexicon or morphology. For example, Roman Indic, a roman transliterated equivalent of a group of languages (e.g., Bengali and Hindi), can be considered a separate language from either Bengali and Hindi in their conventional orthographic script.
- the document language detection process uses statistical learning theories. In one implementation, it uses Naive Bayes classification models to calculate the likelihoods of possible classes and predicts the class that has the maximum likelihood.
- a class is a language/encoding pair that a document can be expressed in, for example, English/ASCII, Japanese/Shift-JIS, or Russian/UTF8. Some languages correspond to multiple classes because they can be encoded in multiple encodings, while some encodings correspond to multiple classes because they can be used to express multiple languages.
- the Naive Bayes models are used to determine the most likely class or classes for a page of text based on the text and (optionally) a Universal Resource Locator (URL) of the page of text.
- URL Universal Resource Locator
- the encoding of a page of text is determined using a Naive Bayes model that predicts the maximum likelihood encoding based on pairings of the bytes that represent the text. If the URL of the page of text is available, the model also factors in the probability of a specific encoding given that the text came from a certain top level domain (i.e., the last part of the Internet domain name).
- the text is converted from its original encoding into Unicode when performing language detection, and the language detection is performed using features.
- natural language words are the best features to use, so the text is segmented into words.
- a Naive Bayes model computes probabilities of individual words given a language and predicts the maximum likelihood language for the text based on the probabilities.
- the Naive Bayes models can be trained and tested using a large sample of electronic documents in various encodings and languages. Training the Naive Bayes model is essentially calculating the probability of a feature given a language.
- the process 100 creates a dictionary containing each unique word found among all the documents in the training corpus (step 125 ). Each instance of a given word found in the corpus is counted according to the identified language of the document it was found in. The frequency of each word in each document language is recorded in the dictionary (step 130 ). For example, if hello is encountered 200 times—150 times within documents identified as English documents and 50 times within documents identified as German documents—then the hello dictionary entry records that hello was found in English and German documents and that it was found 150 and 50 times, respectively.
- a pre-determined blacklist of characters can be defined.
- the blacklist of characters is a list of characters which would not normally occur in documents in that language.
- the blacklist of characters does not necessarily reflect strict inherent characteristics of the language. For example, ‘w’ does not occur in French words so it can be added to the French blacklist. However, borrowed and foreign words that contain a ‘w’ occur in French documents often enough that ‘w’ can be excluded from the French blacklist.
- the list can be determined manually in whole or in part. Alternatively, occurrences of characters in documents known to be in a particular language can be statistically analyzed to inform the manual process or to produce a blacklist of characters automatically.
- Process 100 can use the blacklist of characters to determine whether a word found in the training corpus appears to violate the conventional rules of the language. Such a word is ignored, i.e., it is not inserted into the dictionary. For example, if “QqWwXxYy” is a blacklist of characters for Hungarian, then “xylophone” is ignored when it is found in a Hungarian document.
- the process 100 maps each word entry in the dictionary to a common form for each language in which the word appears (step 140 ).
- the common form is a word that conforms to a simplified, standardized, canonical or otherwise consistent orthography, for example, words expressed without the use of accented characters.
- Process 100 maps each word according to pre-defined and language-specific mappings. For example, a mapping converts “issephant”, found in a document identified as French, to “elephant”.
- a word is mapped to a common form according to language-specific mappings. Every language-specific mapping is a collection of one or more character conversion maps. Each conversion map specifies one or more input characters and one or more output characters to which the one or more input characters are mapped.
- the process 100 replaces the maximal sequence (or prefix) of characters matching the input of a conversion map with the map's one or more output characters. Other characters are copied unchanged. For any given word, the result of this character conversion process generates the word's common form.
- a data structure designed to facilitate longest-prefix matching can be used to store language-specific mappings (e.g., a trie or prefix tree).
- a conversion map that specifies more than one input character is a special case of conversion for mapping words that contain collapsible digraphs.
- Collapsible digraphs are two-character combinations that, in some languages, can be represented as a single, often accented, character. For example, German convention suggests that if ‘Ü’ cannot be typeset, then ‘Ue’ or ‘UE’ is a suitable substitute. Therefore a German document can spell the word “German ber” as “ueber”.
- a two-character conversion map will often collapse the collapsible digraph and de-accent the result. For example, in one implementation, German conversion maps convert both “ueber” and “German” to “uber”.
- the process 100 creates a synonyms map (step 150 ) from: the common form mappings, the dictionary entries, and the entries' associated language statistics.
- Each distinct common form becomes a key in the synonyms map.
- Dictionary entries that map to a given key using a mapping for each of the entry's languages, become the key's values.
- the synonyms map the dictionary entries will be called variants.
- each key is associated with multiple variants, each of which is associated with the variant's language statistics.
- “ BO ⁇ a” is one key whose value refers to at least one variant “ BO ⁇ a”, associated with Russian (but not Serbian).
- “vodka” is another key whose value refers to at least one variant “ BO ⁇ a” associated with Malawin (but not Russian).
- FIG. 2 illustrates one implementation of a process 200 for creating a synonyms map (step 150 of FIG. 1 ).
- the process 200 includes receiving common-form entries, as described above (step 210 ). Any common-form entry containing only one variant that is the same as its common form is omitted from the synonyms map (step 220 ). Such an entry does not provide synonyms for the common form.
- the process 200 also removes any languages associated with a variant that have a frequency that does not exceed a pre-defined absolute threshold (step 230 ).
- the absolute threshold is pre-determined and specified on a per-language basis. This threshold is used to remove variants that are likely to be misspellings or mistakes in the training corpus. For a language that is well represented in the training corpus, a large threshold (e.g., 40 for English) will generally omit obscure misspellings. The threshold for a small language which is not well represented would be set lower (e.g., 10) to preserve legitimate but rare words. The threshold can be turned off (or set to 0) for languages which are poorly-represented in the corpus.
- process 200 omits variants for a key if the variant contains a collapsible digraph and its accented equivalent is not also a variant for the key (step 240 ).
- language-specific blacklists of words can be defined. Each blacklist contains a list of words that should not be a variant associated with a given language. If the variant is on a language's blacklist, that language is de-associated from the variant. For example, if “the” is on the French blacklist, then no variant whose common form is “the” can be associated with the French language. This prevents confusion between the English “the” and the French “thé”.
- the relative frequency of each variant among all the variants for a particular language is calculated (step 250 ).
- the number of times the variant occurs in the language is divided by the total number of occurrences of all variants in the same language for the same key. For example, if the key is “elephant”, and if “eursphant” occurs in English and French, 100 and 1000 times, respectively; and “eléphant” occurs in English and French 90 and 300 times, respectively, then the relative frequency of “eursphant” in English is 52% (i.e., 100/(100+90)).
- the relative frequency of each variant for each language is stored in the synonyms map.
- the process 200 removes any languages where the language's relative frequency does not meet a pre-defined relative threshold (e.g., 10%) (step 260 ).
- a pre-defined relative threshold e.g. 10%
- the same threshold applies to all variants and all languages. Any variants that are not associated with at least one language are also removed from the synonym map (step 270 ).
- the process 200 has been described as a process that alters an existing synonyms map, for example, by removing entries or variants from it.
- the same effect can be achieved during the initial construction of the synonyms map by not including certain entries or variants in the first place.
- FIG. 4 An illustrative example synonyms map is shown in FIG. 4 .
- the illustration assumes that the corpus is represented by four languages: English, French, Roman Indic and Bengali. This map contains three keys, “elephant”, “liberte” and “nityananda”. Each key is associated with numerous variants.
- the variant “nity.a-nanda” ( 410 ) appears in documents from the corpus that are identified as Roman Indic and Bengali. However the variant only occurs in each language 6 times. If an absolute threshold greater than 6 is specified for each language, then these languages and the variant would be removed from the synonyms map.
- the variant “nit ⁇ grave over (y) ⁇ an ⁇ nda” appears in three languages ( 430 ), according to the language's relative frequency, this variant is relatively minor compared to other variants in each language. If a relative frequency threshold of 10% is applied, these languages and the entire variant would be removed from the synonyms map. Assuming the same relative threshold for the “nityAnanda” variant, the association with the Bengali language ( 420 ) would also be removed. This variant and the rest of its language associations would remain since these other languages each occur frequently enough to exceed the assumed relative and absolute thresholds.
- One of the useful things that can be done with a synonyms map is to use it to augment queries made to a search engine.
- a process 300 can be used to augment a query to incorporate synonyms from the synonyms map.
- the query that is received (step 310 ) often imperfectly describes the user's desired query.
- the user is constrained by the limitations of an input device and the inconvenience of accurately indicating the language of the query.
- the ideal synonyms are those that reflect what the user would have provided under ideal circumstances.
- Process 300 is intended to approximate the ideal synonyms by scoring variants in the synonyms map relative to the words in the query and the language intended by the user, which is approximated by the language of the query.
- Process 300 determines the language of the interface that received the query (step 315 ).
- a user provides the query to an interface.
- the interface will have an interface language, that is, a language in which the interface presents information to the user, e.g., English, French, or Esperanto.
- the words within a query are not necessarily in the same language as the interface the query was provided to.
- the process 300 identifies individual words from the query (step 320 ).
- the identification of words depends on the particular conventions of the query language. In Latin script languages, for example, words are delimited by spaces or other punctuation (e.g., ‘-’).
- the process 300 determines which languages the query is likely to be in (step 325 ).
- the query language is determined in two parts: determining a likelihood that the query is in the language of the interface, e.g., a probability; and determining for each term in the query, a likelihood, e.g., a probability, that the term is in some particular language.
- Determining whether the query is likely to be in the same language as the interface language can be done using past queries. If a past query delivered search results, the past query can be automatically classified as being in a particular language based on the language of the results that the user subsequently selected. It is reasonable to assume that the language of the query is the same as the language of the documents the user chose to view, especially if the presentation of choices includes snippets from the search results documents. A past query can also be manually inspected to determine its language. Both automatic and manual techniques can be combined: the queries that have been manually classified serve as seeds used during automatic determination to improve accuracy. Results of the automatic classifier can inform subsequent adjustment of the classifier. Manual seeding and adjustment of the query classifier can be iteratively repeated to further improve the accuracy. The current query, in its entirety, is matched with past queries received by the same interface, generating a likelihood score or a probability that the query is in the same language as the interface language.
- the process 300 determines how often a term from the query occurs in the corpus within documents for each language. From the frequency counts, a vector is generated that, for each language, gives a likelihood score in the range of zero to one that the term is in the language. A score vector, e.g., a probability vector, is generated for each term in the query.
- the scores of such words, if found among the query terms, can be arbitrarily set to suggest that the word is likely in the interface language. Alternatively, such words can be ignored.
- the process 300 can further process each vector by smoothing it.
- a small smoothing value s is added to reduce noise. For example, if term t occurs n times in language L and N times across k languages, then the probability that the term is in the language is smoothed to be P(L
- t) (n+s)/(k ⁇ s+N), rather than P(L
- t) n/N.
- the smoothing value can be selected depending on size of N and k. For example, s can be selected to increase as N increases and to decrease as k increases.
- the resultant vector is multiplied by the probability (or score) that the query is in the language of the interface, producing a query probability (or score) vector.
- This query probability vector contains, for each language, a probability (or score) that the query is in the language. The language with the highest probability (or score) is selected as the query language that is attributed to the query.
- the process 300 simplifies each word in the query (step 330 ).
- the process collapses digraphs, removes accents, and transliterates characters in each word. This is accomplished in exactly the same way as common forms were derived from the training corpus, as described above.
- the specific conversion maps used to simplify query words here are in some respects different from the conversion maps used in the creation of the synonyms map. In particular, simplifying each word is normally language independent.
- the identified query language can affect how query words are simplified. This is particularly important when the result of word simplification makes no sense in the query language. For example, in Vietnamese ‘ue’ is a nonsensical substitution for ‘ü’, unlike in German. Simplifying “Türk” to “Tuerk” would be undesirable for a Turkish user.
- the simplified words from the query are used to look up and retrieve variants from the synonyms map using each simplified words as a key (step 340 ).
- Each variant is a potential synonym of the original query word.
- the relative frequency under a key of each variant within each language is used to estimate whether the variant is desirable as a synonym for the key in each language (step 350 ). This estimate is calculated by summing, for each language, the probability that the query is in the language multiplied by the relative frequency of the variant in that language. For example, consider when “onult” is a variant in English 52% of the time and a variant in French 77% of the time.
- a synonyms probability threshold e.g. 50%
- the particular synonyms probability threshold is selected to provide good results given the language statistics in the synonyms map and the probabilities provided by the query language classifier.
- the relative frequency of the variant is reduced (e.g., quartered) when calculating the variant's estimate. This penalty to the variant's relative frequency reflects the potential risk of having collapsed the variant's digraphs inappropriately.
- Each selected variant is added to the query (step 360 ), unless the variant is a stop word and the variant does not appear in the probable query language: such variants are ignored.
- Each original term from the query is augmented with each of its selected variants.
- Each variant is appended as a disjunction of the original term. For example, the query “eléphant trunk” is augmented to “(eléphant or elephant or eursphant) trunk”, assuming that both elephant and eurs twistedt are selected variants for eléphant.
- the process uses the augmented query to search a search corpus (step 370 ).
- the search corpus contains documents in their original, unaltered form. Except for the effects of augmenting of the query, searching and providing results from the corpus are not otherwise affected.
- the probable query language is an under-represented language in the search corpus (i.e., a small proportion of the total documents), then it can be undesirable to include variants from the synonyms map. Adding variants to the search query increases the risk of matching documents from outside the desired language, potentially overwhelming the results with foreign language documents.
- the original query word contains only unaccented letters and does not contain collapsible digraphs (e.g., “ueber”, simplified to “uber”), then variants should be sought regardless of the probable query language.
- the decision to include variants depends on the interface language rather than the query language.
- FIG. 5A through FIG. 34 illustrate one implementation of the conversion maps used to map words in the training corpus or to simplify words in a search query.
- Each figure shows one or more named groups of conversion maps.
- Each conversion map is shown as one line in one column in the figures.
- a conversion map is shown with at least an input character and an output character, as discussed above.
- columns marked “UCS” show the hexadecimal value of a character's encoding according to the Universal Character Set (UCS). When a UCS value is not given, each character is one of the 95 printable ASCII characters.
- conversion map groups can constitute the language-specific mapping for a particular language.
- the composition of groups for a particular language can depend on whether the groups are used to map words in the training corpus or to simplify words in a query.
- FIGS. 5A , 5 B, and 5 C illustrate a generic group of conversion maps. Generally, these are safe conversion maps that are unlikely to conflict with the conversion maps pertaining to particular languages.
- FIG. 6 illustrates a Russian group of conversion maps. This group is used to map words from Russian documents during generation of the synonyms map.
- FIG. 7 illustrates a Randian group of conversion maps. This group is used to map words from Ardian documents during generation of the synonyms map.
- FIG. 8 illustrates a Ukrainian group of conversion maps. This group is used to map words from Ukrainian documents during generation of the synonyms map.
- FIG. 9 illustrates a Greek group of conversion maps. This group is used to map words from Greek documents during generation of the synonyms map
- some conversion maps also specify the accented equivalent of the collapsed digraph (column headed “A.E.” in the figures). These maps have a two-character input, i.e., the collapsible digraph, and one output, the collapsed digraph.

- FIG. 35 is a schematic diagram of a search engine 3550 that receives multilingual queries and provides multilingual results in response.
- the system 3550 is generally equipped to obtain information about the occurrences and frequency of terms from various sources, and to generate search results in response to queries based upon an analysis of word use in such sources.
- sources could include, for example, multilingual documents and files found on the Internet.
- the system 3550 includes one or more interfaces 3552 each in a different language.
- the interfaces allow users to use and interact with the services of the search engine.
- the interface receives queries from users.
- a query includes a list of words where each word can be in any language. None of the words in the query need be in the language of the interface.
- the specific interface 3552 which receives a user's query is dependent on the user's choice of interface.
- System 3550 can be communicatively connected to a network such as the Internet 3558 , and thereby can communicate with various devices connected to the Internet such as wireless communication devices 3562 , and personal computers 3564 .
- the communication flow for any device can be bidirectional so that system 3550 receives information (e.g., queries or the contents of documents) from the devices and can also send information (e.g., results) to the devices.
- Queries received by the interface 3552 are provided to a query processor 3566 .
- the query processor 3566 processes the query, optionally augments it, and passes it on to another component of system 3550 .
- query processor 3566 can cause the retrieval system 3570 to generate search results corresponding to the query.
- Such a retrieval system 3570 can use data retrieval and search techniques like those used by the Google PageRankTM system. The results generated by retrieval system 3570 can then be provided back to the original querying device.
- the system 3550 can rely on a number of other components for its proper operation.
- the system 3550 refers to a search corpus 3572 of documents each time a request is made.
- the search corpus can be indexed to make searching more efficient.
- the search corpus can be populated using information collected from documents found on the Web (e.g., by a web crawler).
- the documents can also be stored in a training corpus 3574 for subsequent processing.
- the training corpus 3574 can be processed by a synonyms processor 3580 .
- the synonyms processor 3580 can generate a synonyms map 3585 from the training corpus 3574 .
- the synonyms map 3585 can be used by the query processor 3566 to augment search queries with synonyms.
