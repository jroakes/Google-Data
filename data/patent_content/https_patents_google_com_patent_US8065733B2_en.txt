Definitions
- This invention relates generally to computing security, and more particularly but not exclusively, to evolving fragments of computer file system calls (known as detectors) in an Artificial Immune System (AIS) for use in detecting unauthorized computing activities.
- detectors computer file system calls
- AIS Artificial Immune System
- anti-virus anti-worm, anti-Trojan horse
- Most of these technologies are traditional in that new virus, worm, or Trojan horse signatures need to be manually identified and appended to a list.
- the resultant consumer software then also needs to be updated with these new signatures on a regular basis in order to protect the consumer's computer from the newest computer pathogens.
- AIS Artificial Immune System
- Artificial Immune Systems have the potential to provide adaptive solutions to the ever-increasingly severe problem of large-scale computer attacks.
- the central idea behind anti-virus AIS is the establishment of a defined ‘normal’ behavior of a computer's processes. This ‘normal’ behavior is considered the ‘self’ in the biological metaphor, whereas a deviation from this normal behavior is considered ‘non-self’ and potentially harmful to the system.
- the AIS should be able to detect the abnormal functioning of its processes and signal an alert.
- AISs provide an adaptive solution to the computer virus problem. By making the technology adaptive, AISs are simpler and more elegant than the traditional anti-virus solutions.
- a recurring problem is the tradeoff between speed and thoroughness. If speed is crucial, the algorithm may often be designed to be less thorough, which may then lead to a decreased detection rate and/or an increase in false positives. If thoroughness is the priority, then the algorithm that is designed may result in running more slowly, which in turn may be so slowly that the detection of a malign intrusion or other unauthorized activity may be too late to prevent the behavior. Thus, it is with respect to these considerations and others that the present invention has been made.

- the term “or” is an inclusive “or” operator, and is equivalent to the term “and/or,” unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
- the term “based on” is not exclusive and allows for being based on additional factors not described, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
- the meaning of “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural references.
- the meaning of “in” includes “in” and “on.”
- a system, apparatus, and method are directed to evolving detectors in an Artificial Immune System (AIS) for detecting unauthorized computing activities.
- the detectors evolve using a genetic algorithm that is configured to generate other detectors using mutation and/or recombination of parent detectors.
- a population of detectors is generated.
- each detector may be assigned a matching value of zero, and an expectation value of zero.
- the detectors are then compared to logged fragments of system calls within a computing device to modify their matching value. When the matching value for a given detector is equal to or greater than an expectation value, the detector's expectation value may be set to the matching value.
- the detectors are ranked based on how they satisfy a fitness function.
- the detectors may be ranked according to their expectation values.
- the detectors may then generate other detectors using mutation, and/or recombination, or the like, based, in part, on how well the detectors satisfy the fitness function.
- the number of detectors generated may be proportional to their matching value.
- the other detectors, when generated and/or evolved, may be given an initial matching value of zero, and an expectation value based on that of their parents. Detectors continue to generate and/or evolve until a detector's matching value reaches a threshold value, in which case, in one embodiment, the detector may be sent to a server, where it is evaluated to determine if an unauthorized activity is detected.
- AISs are typically premised on the concept that both vertebrates and computers are bombarded with a variety of changing foreign matter against which they must defend themselves.
- vertebrates there is a dynamic repertoire of viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens that evolve through a process of natural selection.
- pathogens such as viruses, worms, and Trojan horses
- computers there are many artificial ‘pathogens’ (such as viruses, worms, and Trojan horses) that are continuously generated and may spread from one computer to another, leaving a trail of ‘infections’ that potentially cause applications to function abnormally and computers to crash.
- a natural immune system evolved whose primary strength is the ability to recognize novel as well as recurrent pathogens.
- Natural immune systems accomplish this recognition feat by generating an idea of protein ‘self’ in the thymus. All protein fragments that fall outside of this normal constitution are considered non-self and therefore potentially harmful to the body.
- Artificial Immune Systems including computing systems that may be designed to be similar to natural immune systems in that they have a definition of ‘self’; however, one difference is that AISs establish ‘self’ through a normal process behavior (usually defined by short sequences of system calls), whereas natural immune systems establish ‘self’ through protein fragment identity.
- FIG. 1 shows a functional block diagram illustrating one embodiment of an environment in which an AIS may be employed.
- an AIS may be employed.
- not all of these components may be required to practice the invention, and variations in the arrangement and type of the components may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.

- FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating one embodiment of a possible detector 110 employed in an AIS, such as shown in FIG. 1 .
- Detector 110 represents a fragment (sequence) of computer file system calls, which can be either exactly or partially matched by a currently running software process's audited file system calls, as a function of a given set of matching rules.
- the sequence of system calls may include of any length of or number of calls that comprise detector 110 .
- detector 110 of FIG. 2 is not intended to limit contents, lengths, or other aspects of detectors.
- detector 110 may include a name field that uniquely identifies a process being evaluated, a time stamp indicating when a detector how long a detector may live before it is terminated, or the like.
- Responses 112 illustrated in FIG. 1 can be substantially similar to detectors 110 structures, in that responses 112 may be fragments (sequences) of system calls that are matched by the detectors 110 when compared to the audited process log. Responses 112 may, in one embodiment, be sequences of system calls that are based, in part, on actions performed by a process being evaluated. In one embodiment, the sequence of system calls may be converted into a sequence of Booleans based on a determined algorithm. Moreover, in one embodiment, responses 112 may be a detector 110 that is provided for evaluation.
- sequence calls are numerically encoded and combined into a number. Encoding the sequence calls is directed at obscuring the meaning of detector 110 and/or responses 112 further, as the number may have different meanings based on the algorithm employed to encode the sequence, thus making it more difficult for a client side user to determine how the invention functions.
- Encoding schemes for the sequence calls may be implemented in a variety of ways depending upon the number of system calls in a given sequence, the format of the detector rules, and the like.
- a generic hashing function may be employed to encode the system calls within detector 110 and/or responses 112 , without departing from the scope or spirit of the present invention.
- the first category of detector 110 is called self-detectors.
- Self-detectors include system call fragments that are typically located in a saturated self-database, i.e., a database that includes a set of possible sequences of system calls seen in a normal execution of software process 108 .
- client software process 108 may provide a response that indicates an acknowledgment that the self-detector has been found in its audit log (not shown).
- the second category of detector 110 is called non-self detectors, and includes sets of sequences of system calls that are not seen in the normal execution of software process 108 . This might include those non-self sequences representing abnormal behaviors, corrupted processes, unauthorized behaviors, or the like. As shown in FIG. 1 , AIS detection system 114 may generate self-detectors and/or non-self detectors.
- server device 102 of FIG. 1 may provide detectors 110 to client device 106 over network 104 . Positive or negative responses 112 in turn are communicated to server device 102 , depending on whether the detectors have been matched by the audited system call fragments of software process 108 on client device 106 .
- the AIS detection system 114 on server device 102 evaluates the client's responses 112 to determine whether the client's software process 108 's actions may be unauthorized.
- the system can perform either: (a) a comparison of file system call fragments from the audited software process to an entire self-database of about 10,000 in size to determine which, and how many of the fragments are non-self, or (b) a comparison of file system call fragments from the audited software process to a fraction of the non-self fragments from the non-self database of size 10,239,999,990,000 to determine which, and how many of the audited fragments fall under the non-self category.
- the larger this fraction the more likely it is for a malign or unauthorized process to be identified, but the slower and more processor-intensive the algorithm will likely be on the client-side.
- logged data fragments are compared to the self or non-self database
- either of these databases may be compressed to a smaller size using ‘rules’.
- a fragment with a 9-system-call matching rule such as ‘3-12-2-6-7-*-3-1-9-11’ (where * is any of the numbers representing a possible file system call) might enable the compression of up to 20 individual file system call fragments, given that there are 20 different file system calls in the database (e.g., the alphabet).
- a rule with 2*'s might compress up to 400 fragments into one rule fragment, thus reducing the number of detectors sent to the client.
- these rules usually also expand the self-space to cover some non-self space, reducing the ability to detect some malignly acting software processes.
- Non-self space may be covered with detectors of different chunking sizes. For example, if self space includes no file system calls fragments that have the file system call numerically identified as 15 in them, then a detector of length 1 consisting of the file system call ‘15’ could match any of the following fragments: 15-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*, *-15-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*, *-*-15-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*, *-*-*-*-15-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*, *-*-*-*-15-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*, *-*-*-*-*-15-*-*-*-*-*-*-*, *-*-*-*-*-15-*-*-*-*-*-*-*, *-*-*-*-*-15-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
- the present invention targets these shortcomings of a typical AIS, providing a method for establishing a lightweight solution for successfully detecting the presence of malignly acting processes.
- Gs Genetic Algorithms
- EAs use the concept of natural selection to evolve solutions, be they numerical solutions or conceptual solutions. They are often seen in engineering disciplines, and have started being used in many other fields, including biology, physics, and architecture.
- GAs Genetic Algorithms specifically focus on evolving numerical solutions to problems whose solution ‘space’ is too large to perform an exhaustive search over. In many of their applications, the number of possible numerical solutions to a given problem exceeds an available or allowed computational capacity. GAs address this quantity-of-solutions predicament by looking for good and sufficient solutions as opposed to a globally optimal solution. By allowing for this tradeoff, GAs greatly increase the speed of attaining solutions as well as the quality of the attained solutions, given a limited amount of time and processing capacity.
- GAs use the concept of natural selection to accomplish this feat.
- Natural selection is the biological idea that there are many genetic variations in a population of a given species, and that a subset of this population is more adapted to its environment, and therefore has an advantage in its survivorship and fecundity. The frequency of positive genetic traits in the population therefore increases over generations. Variations in the population, on which natural selection can act, never cease to exist due to two genetic mechanisms: Mutation and recombination.
- Genetic Algorithms loosely incorporate these ideas of natural selection for use as a machine learning method.
- a random population of solutions is first created. These solutions are then ranked in accordance with how well they provide a solution to the given problem. This ranking is done, for example, via an established fitness function, which is analogous to a natural environmental pressure.
- the solution then gets to provide child solutions for the next generation based on how well it performed according to the fitness function. The better the solution is the more genetic material it gets to pass on to the next generation.
- the ideas of recombination and mutation may also be incorporated into the algorithm.
- When a parent solution creates offspring solutions those offspring solutions are not exact replicas of the parent; they are slightly different depending on what portion of the solution was mutated in its passage to the next generation. Recombination is performed by breaking solutions and re-annealing them with other solutions, providing a mechanism for vastly new solutions to be generated.
- the present invention provides a genetic algorithm (GA) to generate detectors to match the most frequent fragments logged by an audited process. From previous studies, it has been seen that a malign software process may log hundreds of unique non-self sequences of file system calls. A substantial portion of these non-self fragments arises with high frequency.
- the AIS problem is that there are too many detectors, or ‘solutions’, to exhaustively check through, given the AIS's desired characteristics of being lightweight and fast.
- the GA applied to AIS would ‘evolve’ detectors that are capable of determining the benign or malign nature of the audited process.

- FIG. 8 illustrates a logical flow diagram generally showing one embodiment of a process of evolving detectors in an AIS for detecting an unauthorized computing activity. Actions of process 800 of FIG. 8 may be implemented, in one embodiment, within client device 306 and server device 302 of FIG. 3 .
- Process 800 begins, after a start block, at block 802 , where an initial population of detectors is generated.
- the initial population may be of virtually any number of detectors, based on knowledge of the process being evaluated, engineering judgment, suspected unauthorized activities, knowledge of the client device, or any of a variety of other factors.
- a typical initial population size may range between 100-600 detectors. However, other sizes may be also generated.
- Each detector within the initial population of detectors may be randomly generated, or generated in a directed manner through the use of additional information such as specific patterns to look for in the audited process.
- at least one detector may be randomly generated, while at least another detector may be generated based on a known pattern.
- the invention is not so constrained, and virtually any other combination or other criteria may be employed in the generation of the initial population of detectors.
- each generated detector may be initialized with a matching value of zero and an expectation value of zero.
- the matching value represents the highest matching percentage between the client-side logged software process fragments and the detector, while the expectation value designates the percent matching value to be exceeded in order for detector reproduction to occur.
- Processing thus, flows next to block 804 , where a comparison is performed between each detector and computer system call fragments associated with the process being evaluated.
- Each detector's matching value is recomputed as a result of this comparison. For example, given a detector fragment of length 10, if 1/10 of the file system calls between the audited fragment and the detector are the same, then the detector's new matching value might be 10%; if 2/10, then the new matching value might be set to 20%, and similarly, up to 100% for an exact match.
- the invention is not constrained to this example, and other values may be chosen for setting a detector's matching value, without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
- processing continues to decision block 806 , where a determination is made whether the revised or recomputed matching value for each detector is equal to or exceeds that detector's expectation value. In a first round through process 800 , this would be the case. In any event, if the matching value is less than the expectation value, processing flows to decision block 816 . Otherwise, if the matching value does equal or exceed the expectation value, then processing flows to block 808 , where that detector is given the recomputed matching value as its new expectation value. Processing then continues to decision block 810 , where a determination is made whether the matching value for a detector exceeds a threshold value.
- a pseudo-generational cycle may continue throughout the executing life of the process being evaluated, where a detector performs a hill-climbing with respect to its matching value, while the detector's matching value is anticipated to climb to a threshold value.
- the threshold value may be a fragment match of 100%. However, other threshold values may also be selected. For example, in one embodiment, a 98% match, or the like, may also be selected.
- block 822 may be performed remote from the client device, to avoid tampering of the detection activity.
- the detector is evaluated against the self database to determine its self or non-self status, e.g., normal or abnormal functioning of the audited process, respectively.
- processing flows next to decision block 824 , where a determination is made whether unauthorized activity is detected. If so, processing flows to block 826 ; otherwise, processing may loop back to block 804 to continue hill-climbing of other detectors, or termination of process 800 .
- any of a variety of detection responses may be performed, including, but not limited to sending an alert message, inhibited sending of information to the client device, sending an instruction or the like to the client device to inhibit further actions by the process being audited, or the like.
- process 800 may return to a calling process to perform other actions.
- processing may flow to block 812 , where detectors are evolved.
- Detector evolution has several properties.
- the number of children detectors generated by a detector may be proportional to the detector's matching value: the higher the matching value, the more children it may be allowed to have. This weighting may be used to adjust for the smaller likelihood of evolving into a higher percentage match if the matching value is already high.
- the mutation rate may be detector specific, with higher mutation rates corresponding to lower matching values for the same probability reasons.
- FIG. 6 shows one embodiment of a parent detector undergoing mutation in order to generate a mutated detector child.
- the child detector 604 is in every way identical to the parent detector 602 , except that its third file system call is ‘WRITE’ instead of the parental ‘READ’.
- WRITE third file system call
- a child detector may also grow its fragment length, reduce its fragment length, and/or change more than one system calls, without departing from the scope of the invention. In is therefore apparent that variation in the population is kept or generated.
- FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating one embodiment of recombination between two detectors, in order to create a child detector.
- the first four file system calls of child detector 706 come from parent detector 702
- the last two file system calls come from parent detector 704 .
- any of a variety of other combinations may be performed during combining of parent detectors to generate or evolve a child detector.
- a child detector may evolve from more than two parent detectors, different segments of parent detectors, or the like.
- processing moves from block 812 of FIG. 8 to block 814 , where each child detector is given initial matching values of zero, and their expectation values are inherited from their parent detectors.
- the expectation value may be the same as the parent's expectation value.
- the child's expectation value may be a combination of the parent's expectation values, such as a mean value, or the like. In any event, processing then loops back to block 804 .
- the children detectors constitute a new population of detectors to be compared to the audited process fragments.
- all of the detectors have their matching values reevaluated, at block 804 .
- a parent detector has its expectation value equaled or exceeded, that detector is again allowed to replicate, at block 812 ; if its children have their expectation values equaled or exceeded, they are also allowed to replicate, at block 812 .
- decision block 816 a determination is made whether to delete the detector.
- a detector may be deleted based on failure to satisfy the test at decision block 816 , or any of a variety of other criteria, including, for example, whether the detector has exceeded a time limit, or the like.
- process 800 may return to the calling process to perform other actions; otherwise, process 800 may loop back to block 804 , to continue evolving detectors, and hill-climbing with respect to a detector's matching value, until process 800 is concluded.
- the invention maintains the lightweight nature of an AIS system, while greatly increasing its ability to detect malign hacks or other unauthorized activities given about the same detector population size.
- the present invention further covers fragment space intelligently. It may also evolve more quickly to frequently seen fragments, whether normal or abnormal. This behavior of the invention is directed towards producing fewer false positives than other AIS embodiments that may not contain a detector-evolving algorithm.
- the invention may also be implemented to minimize communication between the server device 302 and the client device 306 over the network 104 of FIG. 3 , thereby strengthening the security of the AIS.
- each block of the flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustration can be implemented by computer program instructions.
- These program instructions may be provided to a processor to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute on the processor, create means for implementing the actions specified in the flowchart block or blocks.
- the computer program instructions may be executed by a processor to cause a series of operational steps to be performed by the processor to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions, which execute on the processor to provide steps for implementing the actions specified in the flowchart block or blocks.
- blocks of the flowchart illustration support combinations of means for performing the specified actions, combinations of steps for performing the specified actions and program instruction means for performing the specified actions. It will also be understood that each block of the flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustration, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems which perform the specified actions or steps, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.
