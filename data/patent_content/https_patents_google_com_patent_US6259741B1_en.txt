- a video image is defined by a number of picture elements, also known as pixels or pels.
- a pixel which is the smallest element of a raster scan line in the image, has an associated color space.
- Y is a luminance component
- Cr and Cb are color difference components.
- Various sampling formats have been defined, including 4:4:4, 4:2:2, and 4:2:0.
- a macroblock has four 8 ⁇ 8 Y blocks, two 8 ⁇ 8 Cr blocks and two 8 ⁇ 8 Cb blocks.
- the sampling frequencies for the Y, Cr and Cb components may be 13.5 MHz, 6.75 MHz and 6.75 MHz, respectively.
- a macroblock has four 8 ⁇ 8 Y blocks, one 8 ⁇ 8 Cr block and one 8 ⁇ 8 Cb block.
- various digital video coding standards have been developed for coding video data including, in particular, the MPEG-2 standard, defined in ISO/IEC 13818-2 MPEG-2 Video (ITU-R H.262), 1995.
- MPEG-2 designates several sets of constrained parameters using a two-dimensional ranking order.
- One of the dimensions called the “profile” series, specifies the coding features supported.
- the other dimension called “level”, specifies the picture resolutions, bit rates, and so forth. that can be accommodated.
- the most important profile-level combination is called Main Profile at Main Level, or MP@ML.
- MP@ML supports a 4:2:0 color subsampling ratio.
- the Simple Profile is similar to the Main Profile but has no B-pictures.
- the SNR Scaleable Profile adds SNR scalability to the Main Profile.
- the Spatially Scaleable Profile adds spatial scalability to the SNR Scaleable Profile.
- the High Profile adds a 4:2:2 color format capability to the Spatially Scaleable Profile.
- the Main Level is defined for CCIR 601 video, while the Simple Level is defined for Standard Intermediate Format (SIF) video. Additionally, two higher levels for HDTV are the High-1440 Level, with a maximum of 1440 pixels per line, and the High Level, with a maximum of 1920 pixels per line.
- SIF Standard Intermediate Format
- 4:2:2 profile also referred to as 4:2:2 P
- 4:2:2 P has recently been developed, which accommodates both 4:2:2 and 4:2:0 color formats.
- ISO/IEC 13818-2 Amendment 2 MPEG-2 4:2:2 Profile at Main Level, January 1996
- ANSI/SMPTE 308 M SMPTE STANDARD for television—MPEG-2 4:2:2 Profile at High Level, 1997
- ISO/IEC 13818-2 Proposed Draft Amendment 5, 4:2:2 Profile at High Level, March 1998 each of which is incorporated herein by reference.
- the 4:2:2 profile is intended for professional video applications where ease of editing of compressed video and multiple-generation encoding/decoding of video are important requirements.
- the primary applications targeted by this profile are:
- Video tape or disk recording for professional use (contribution quality)
- 4:2:2 P can provide higher video quality, better chroma resolution and allows a higher bit-rate (at Main Level(ML), up to 50 Mbit/s) than Main Profile (e.g., MP@ML).
- 4:2:2 P provides separate quantization matrices for luma and chroma data.
- very high quality video and ITU-R 601 4:2:2 video format are often needed for ease of chroma keying and other special effects. Because of the requirement of ease of editing, more frequent INTRA pictures are necessary, which also results in high coding bit-rates.
- 4:2:2 P permits all I-picture encoding. This enables fast recovery from transmission errors and can simplify editing applications.
- 4:2:2 P with a 4:2:0 color format can provide a better quality image than MP with the same color format since 4:2:2 P allows greater quantization precision.
- 4:2:2 P further allows the high bit rates required to maintain high quality while using only I-picture coding.
- 4:2:2 P also allows the use of P- and B-picture coding types, which can further improve quality or reduce bit rate for the same quality.
- TV studios typically produce “contribution quality” video, which usually is ITU-R 601 source video, or 4:2:2 P@ML (or 4:2:2 P@HL) compressed video. This video is then encoded and transmitted as “distribution quality” TV.
- Digital television and HDTV in North America have adopted MPEG-2 MP@ML and MP@HL as their video coding standard. Both MP@ML and MP@HL encode and transmit only 4:2:0 format distribution quality video.
- MP provides a common quantization matrix for luma and chroma data. For example, the aggregate data rate for a HDTV system, which includes compressed video, compressed audio, conditional access, and an auxiliary data channel, is around 18 to 20 Mbits/s.
- the system should allow reuse of motion vectors, avoid the need to change MB coding types, and use only a single MC unit for processing chroma blocks.
- the system should further provide the capability to perform a decimate-filtering process on residue chroma-blocks in the INTER coded MBs.
- the system should provide a simple approach to replace the chroma quantization matrix during format conversion it if appears in the 4:2:2 P bitstreams.
- the system should refine the CBP for chroma blocks.
- the system should also provide adjustment of the MPEG DC coefficient precision variable, intra_dc_precision, as required to conform to the coding standard used. For example, the maximum allowed intra_dc_precision level for a MP bitstream is lower than that for a 4:2:2 P bitstream.
- the system should provide a combined 4:2:2 to 4:2:0 converter and a normal transcoder to perform 4:2:2 P to MP transcoding with a format conversion.
- the system should avoid the need to fully decode the processed bitstream during the format conversion.
- the present invention provides a system having the above and other advantages.
- the invention relates to approaches to converting the format of a digital video bitstream, such as for converting a 4:2:2 P pre-compressed contribution quality bitstream to a MP distribution quality bitstream.
- a method for converting a pre-conversion bitstream having a first format to a post-conversion bitstream having a second format includes the steps of: at least partially decompressing the pre-conversion bitstream to recover chroma data therein in a pixel domain, recovering quantization matrix data associated with luma data from the pre-conversion bitstream, and re-compressing data corresponding to the recovered chroma data.
- the re-compressing includes re-quantizing of the data corresponding to the recovered chroma data according to the recovered luma quantization matrix to provide the post-conversion bitstream.
- the method includes the further steps of: recovering motion vectors associated with the luma data from the pre-conversion bitstream, using the recovered luma motion vectors to perform first motion compensation processing of the recovered chroma data for the inter-coded images, where the first motion compensation processing using the first chroma format, filtering the chroma data after the first motion compensation processing to provide chroma data that has a second chroma format that corresponds to the second format of the post-conversion bitstream, and using the recovered luma motion vectors to perform second motion compensation processing of the chroma data with the second chroma format to provide the data for the re-compressing step.
- one chroma block is provided for at least every two chroma blocks in the first chroma format (e.g., two blocks for 4:2:2 and one block for 4:2:0).
- Data corresponding to the chroma data with the second chroma format provided by the filtering step is transformed from a pixel domain to a transform domain, then quantized, then inverse quantized and then inverse transformed to provide data for the second motion compensation processing.
- the method may include the further steps of recovering a first quantization precision level from the pre-conversion bitstream, and if the first quantization precision level is greater than a maximum allowed precision level of the second format of the post-conversion bitstream: (i) lowering the first quantization precision level, (ii) recovering DC luma transform data from the pre-conversion bitstream, and (iii) re-quantizing data corresponding to the recovered DC luma transform data according to the lowered quantization precision level.
- the method includes the further steps of: filtering the recovered chroma data to provide residue chroma data that has a second chroma format that corresponds to the second format of the post-conversion bitstream, recovering motion vectors associated with the luma data from the pre-conversion bitstream, and using the recovered luma motion vectors to perform motion compensation processing of data corresponding to the residue chroma data for the inter-coded images to provide the data for the re-compressing step.
- the motion compensation processing uses the second chroma format, so only one motion compensator is required. The errors introduced are generally not problematic since chroma errors are less detectable than luma errors in the resulting image.
- the first format may be the MPEG 4:2:2 Profile format
- the second format may be the MPEG Main Profile format
- a coded block pattern of the pre-conversion bitstream may be modified for use in the post-conversion bitstream.
- the pre-conversion bitstream and the post-conversion bitstream may use the same macroblock coding type.
- the re-quantization step may be responsive to a rate control signal for setting a bit rate of the post-conversion bitstream.
- the recovered luma quantization matrix may be modified to improve coding efficiency of the post-conversion bitstream.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a first approach to 4:2:2 P to MP bitstream converting in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a second approach to 4:2:2 P to MP bitstream converting in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 3 illustrates chrominance block bitstream conversion from a 4:2:2 P 4:2:2 bitstream to a MP 4:2:0 bitstream in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a simplified chrominance-block bitstream conversion from a 4:2:2 P 4:2:2 bitstream to a MP 4:2:0 bitstream in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an approximated chrominance-block bitstream conversion from a 4:2:2 P 4:2:2 bitstream to a MP 4:2:0 bitstream in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 6 illustrates a chrominance-block bitstream conversion from a 4:2:2 P 4:2:0 bitstream to a MP 4:2:0 bitstream in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 8 illustrates a combination of a 4:2:2 to 4:2:0 converter and a transcoder in accordance with the present invention.
- the invention relates to approaches to converting a 4:2:2 P pre-compressed contribution quality bitstream to a MP distribution quality bitstream.
- a MPEG-2 transcoder is an instrument which converts a pre-compressed MPEG-2 bit stream into another MPEG-2 bit stream at a new rate.
- a transcoder for converting an MPEG-2 4:2:2 P@ML (or 4:2:2 P@HL) bit stream to MP@ML (or MP@HL) bit stream can be a cascaded 4:2:2 P (@ML or @HL) or MP transcoder and a 4:2:2 to 4:2:0 converter with rate-control.
- the following transcoding cases are of particular interest: 4:2:2 P@ML to MP@ML, 4:2:2 P@HL to MP@ML, and 4:2:2 P@HL to MP@HL.
- Transcoding from HL to ML is very common, e.g., from HDTV format to SDTV format.
- transcoding from ML to HL generally is not of interest since it results in a higher bit rate but does not improve picture quality. If one wants a higher resolution from an ML bitstream, the bitstream can be decoded, and post-processing interpolation can be used to enlarge the image.
- FIGS. 1 and 2 There are two different approaches, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, to achieve 4:2:2 P to MP transcoding.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a first approach to 4:2:2 P to MP bitstream transcoding in accordance with the present invention.
- a 4:2:2 to 4:2:0 bitstream converter 110 partially decodes the 4:2:2 bitstream and re-assemble the results to provide a MP bitstream.
- a conventional 4:2:0 transcoder 120 is then used to generate a new MP compressed bit stream at a new rate.
- a rate control function 130 controls the rate of the bitstream that is output by the transcoder 120 .
- FIG. 2 illustrates a second approach to 4:2:2 P to MP bitstream transcoding in accordance with the present invention.
- a 4:2:2 P transcoder 210 is cascaded with a 4:2:2 to 4:2:0 bitstream converter 220 to generate a MP compressed bitstream at a new rate, under the control of a rate control function 230 .
- the present invention focuses on the 4:2:2 to 4:2:0 bitstream converter 110 , 220 .
- the 4:2:2 P@ML format is an extension to the MP@ML format in many ways.
- the key ML features are summarized in Table 1.
- 4:2:2 P@HL is an extension to MP@HL in many ways.
- the key HL features are summarized in Table 2.
- macroblock_type indicates a number of different characteristics of a macroblock, including:
- macroblock_intra whether the macroblock is intra-coded
- the MPEG parameter intra_dc_precision is 2-bit integer defined to have the binary value 00, 01, 10 or 11 to designate a precision of 8, 9, 10 or 11 bits, respectively.
- a two-dimensional array of coefficients, QF[v] [u] is inverse quantized to produce the reconstructed DCT coefficients.
- This process is essentially a multiplication by the quantizer step size.
- the quantizer step size is modified by two mechanisms. Namely, a weighting matrix is used to modify the step size within a block, and a scale factor is used so that the step size can be modified at the cost of only a few bits (as compared to encoding an entire new weighting matrix).
- inverse quantization arithmetic is performed on the transform coefficients in the bitstream to be converted using quantiser_scale_code, an unsigned, non-zero integer in the range 1 to 31 that indicates the quantisation scale factor, and weighting matrices W[w] [v] [u].
- the resulting coefficients, F′′[v] [u] are saturated to yield F′[v] [u], and then a mismatch control operation is performed to give the final reconstructed DCT coefficients, F[v] [u].
- Two weighting matrices are used for 4:2:0 data —one for intra macroblocks (luma and chroma), and the other for non-intra macroblocks (luma and chroma).
- 4:2:2 data four matrices are used (intra luma, intra chroma, non-intra luma, and non-intra chroma).
- intra luma, intra chroma, non-intra luma, and non-intra chroma four matrices are used (intra luma, intra chroma, non-intra luma, and non-intra chroma).
- the DC value of a two-dimensional array of quantized DCT transform coefficients, QF[0] [0], is treated differently than the AC values.
- B d (n) is the decoder (VBV) buffer fullness just before decoding picture n
- R is the bit rate.
- the vbv_delay and vbv_buffer_size re-setting require a quantization feedback loop to avoid over- or under-flow of the VBV buffer and the actual rate buffer.
- the new coded block pattern (CBP) for the chroma block of a MB in the MP-bitstream is determined by the re-quantized chrominance data.
- the CBP indicates the number of coded blocks for each macroblock, e.g., eight coded blocks for 4:2:2 color format, or six coded blocks for 4:2:0 color format.
- syntax change F may involve changing the CBP to indicate the presence of two rather than four chroma blocks. No change to the number of luma blocks (e.g., four blocks) occurs.
- the 4:2:0 format of 4:2:2 P is also an important case. It differs from ML even though both of them have the same resolution since, with 4:2:2 P, both luma and chroma can have different quantization matrices. In contrast, with ML, both luma and chroma use the same quantization matrix. Experiments show that coding with the separate luma and chroma matrices can provide a better quality image.
- load_chroma_intra_quantiser_matrix is a one-bit flag which is set to “1” if chroma_intra_quantiser_matrix follows. If it is set to “0”, there is no change in the values that shall be used. If chroma_format is “14:2:0” (i.e., 10), the flag takes the value “0”.
- chroma_intra_quantiser_matrix is a list of sixty-four, non-zero 8-bit unsigned integers used for quantizing intra chroma transform values.
- load_chroma_non_intra_quantiser_matrix is a one-bit flag which is set to “1” if chroma_non_intra_quantiser_matrix follows. If it is set to “0”, there is no change in the values that shall be used. If chroma_format is “4:2:0” (i.e., 01), this flag takes the value “0”.
- chroma_non_intra_quantiser_matrix is a list of sixty-four, non-zero 8-bit unsigned integers used for quantizing non-intra chroma transform values.

- a luma MC function 820 is also provided to provide motion compensation of the luma data in the received bitstream. Note that the MVs are re-used to avoid the need for motion estimation.
- the present invention provides a system for converting the color format of a digital video bitstream.
- the system accounts for the allowable formats of the pre- and—post-conversion bitstreams, including quantizer precision level, and whether luma and chroma data have separate quantization matrices, or share a common quantization matrix.
- an MPEG-2 4:2:2 P bitstream having a color format of 4:2:2 or 4:2:0 i.e., the pre-conversion bitstream
- a MP bitstream having a color format of 4:2:0 (i.e., the post-conversion bitstream).
- Coding efficiencies are achieved by using the luma quantization matrix to re-quantize the chroma data, and re-using luma motion vectors for performing motion compensation of the chroma data.
- Simplifications can also be made for a 4:2:2 P 4:2:0 format pre-conversion bitstream.
- An efficient conversion for luma blocks is disclosed when the quantization precision of the pre-conversion bitstream is not compatible with that of the post-conversion bitstream.
- a transcoding format converter is also disclosed for achieving a different bit rate in the post-conversion bitstream.
