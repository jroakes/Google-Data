The microphone crossed on client device is spoken to be interacted with the first application.In some implementations, client device includes
Camera and user, which apply via camera with first, to be interacted.
In the stage 320, the presentation that client device requests second are applied, such as to 140 (such as Fig. 1 of preview Distributor
Shown in) send request.In some implementations, include indicating request method, apparatus also just to the request of the presentation of the second application
It is the data of the characteristic of client device 120.For example, request may indicate that the brand and model of client device 120, instruction operation
System is built or version, indicates the physical attribute, etc. of such as screen size, processor chipset, available memory.At some
In realization method, the second application specified to the request of the presentation of the second application.In some implementations, it is in the second application
Existing request is the request to any arbitrary second application.For example, request can be transmitted to responsible selection from client device 120
It is delivered to the preview Distributor 140 of the content of client device 120.Preview Distributor 140 can be then pre-
Session of looking at identifies specific application.In some implementations, preview Distributor 140 is so that the preview meeting applied for second
Words content is for example delivered to client device 120 from preview host server 170.In some implementations, preview is distributed
Server 140 provides preview session request data to client device 120, and the request of client device 120 comes from preview master
The delivering of the preview session content for the second application of machine server 170.In some implementations, which is embedded in
In unified request finger URL (uniform request locator, URL).For example, in some implementations, preview distribution
Server 140 provides URL to client device 120 and client device 120 is attempted to fetch data from the URL of offer, practical
On be request preview session content.In some implementations, request is formatted according to customization request protocol, such as is wrapped
Include the agreement of ciphering signature and/or CIPHERING REQUEST identifier.
In the stage 330, the second application is presented in the interactive preview session in the first application in client device.It is interactive
It is user's chance interactive with third party content (that is, second application) that session, which is presented, in preview.For example, the second application can be rendered as
Award machine meeting in first application gives user by watching third party content or with third party content interaction (for example, preview is another
One application) earn the chance of whatsit (excitation).Excitation can be the reward in the first application itself, or can be pair
The access rights of whatsit outside.For example, if using being game, excitation can be the additional " trip in game
Play number " or " life ", to resource in additional game, the access rights of rank or feature, authorize currency in additional game
Or the acceleration, etc. of the game interior element of credit, additional object for appreciation playtime, time delay.If using being utility, example
Such as photo editor program or present utility, then excitation can be to additional tool, filter, customized graphics, clip art,
The access rights of " paster " etc..Some applications can be dependent on back-end server, such as back-end server is applied shown in Fig. 1
130, and encourage and can be bundled with the utilization of resources on back-end server.For example, using may include executing on back-end server
Function, and user can be awarded the access rights to back-end function based on the interaction with third party content.As another
Example, to store data using back-end server and encourage can be additional data space using permissible.At some
In realization method, outside excitation is applied.In some implementations, excitation be at the restaurant, retail shop, amusement park, movie theatre,
The discount coupon or ticket that performance venue, equipment leasing place, service provider etc. etc. can fulfil.In some implementations,
Excitation is the entrance of prize drawing or raffle.Excitation can be using anything for being used for rewarding user and third party content interaction.
In some implementations, using by instantiating interaction via the function call to Application Programming Interface (API)
Formula preview presents session that third party content is presented to user.In some implementations, using by using in software development
The interactive preview of utility instantiation provided in person's kit (SDK) presents session that third party content is presented to user.
In some implementations, using by via the function call to dynamic load library (dynamic load library, DLL)
The interactive preview of instantiation presents session that third party content is presented to user.In some implementations, second application be
By what is presented in the display window of the first application formulation frame.For example, in fig. 2b, transition screen 230 be illustrated as being presented on by
First application is formulated in the display window of frame.In some implementations, this window be used to present the second application.When
When being presented in this window, the second application is presented in the situation of the first application.The smaller display space of window
It can reduce and change between display device (that is, the frame part of display is with different screen size or resolution ratio
May be variation between equipment, while allowing window itself there is more consistent size and resolution ratio).In some realization methods
In, the second application is presented using entire screen.For example, in fig. 2 c, the graphic user interface (GUI) 240 shown is to make
With the entire screen 205 on illustrative touch panel device 200 for the exemplary startup screen for demonstrating game can be played, wherein having
The message column 250 of exit button 255 is laminated on GUI 240.When using entire screen 205 present when, second application be by
The identical mode of the mode that will watch of user in the case of the second application installation on a client device is presented with user
's.That is, by using entire screen 205, user receives and allows second to apply preview experience similar in local runtime.
In the stage 340, client device detection is interacted with the user of the second application.From the perspective of user, in client
The second application presented at end equipment is interactive.Any interface interaction that user can be presented with the second application, such as pass through
Tapping on the virtual push button shown on touching sensitive screen curtain.In some implementations, user can be by pressing or actuating visitor
Physical button in the end equipment of family to interact with the second application.In some implementations, user can by rotation, tilt, shake
It shakes or otherwise physically mobile client device to interact with the second application.In general, user can be used to and local
Any interactive mode of the application interaction of installation can be used in interacting with the second application, even if the second application is not installed in this
Ground.These interactions are happened at local device, wherein each alternative events are connect by the one or more sensors on local device
It receives and is performed handled by environment.For example, if user rotates client device, this activity is by motion sensor
(for example, accelerometer, gyroscope or tilt switch) detects and in performing environment by device driver or sensor tube
Manage device processing.Client device by the conversion of motion detected at software event or signal, the subsequent quilt of the software event or signal
It reports to the first application or reports to the second application.In some implementations, it second applies in preview host server 170
On simulated environment such as virtual machine in execute, and client device by alternative events description be sent to preview host server
170, herein its be provided to the second application.Data flow from sensor to application is discussed in greater detail below with reference to Fig. 4.
In the stage 350, in response to detecting that interaction, client device provide interaction to host server in the stage 340
Description.For example, in some implementations, client device is the description of the interaction detected in the stage 340 via network 110
(as shown in fig. 1) is sent to preview host server 170.It describes to provide sufficient information to take in host to host server
Heavy losses are established diplomatic relations mutually at business device, such as are used as the input to the second application.In some implementations, client device capture, hook
Firmly or input pickup on client device is intercepted (for example, touch screen, accelerometer, inclination sensor, button, wheat
Gram wind or optical sensor) signal and the signal for capturing, hooking or intercepting is transmitted to host server.In some realization sides
In formula, the information for being sent to host server is packetized in data structure.For example, client device can wrap in data structure
Additional contextual information is included, such as indicates when to detect interactive time value.In some implementations, interaction description (or
Person includes the data structure of interaction description) it is compressed at client device, and client device is by host server
The information of transmission compression to provide interaction description to host server.
In the stage 360, whether client device judgement preview session has terminated.Preview session can be for example in predetermined length
It is terminated ahead of time (for example, being moved back as user's selection when time has passed, when the second application terminates or in client device requests
Go out the result of button) when terminate.In some implementations, client device has received instruction preview session from host server
The signal of termination.In some implementations, client device generates and has sent instruction preview session eventually to host server
Signal only.
In the stage 370, judge that the client device of preview conversation end is applied back to first.In some realization methods
In, in preview ession for telecommunication, the first application do not receive it is any interactively enter because all this interaction datas are actually all in rank
It is redirected to host server in section 350.In some implementations, after being applied back to first in the stage 370, client
End equipment provides feedback or the analysis about preview session to the first application.
In some implementations, analyzer is interacted to the interactive application detected in the stage 340 and is soundd out.Handle is soundd out in interaction
Indicate that the data acquisition system that the alternative events that ession for telecommunication occurs are presented in preview is converted into user and the media of client device 120
The possibility for having flowed interactive.Exploration can be used for judging user preview present ession for telecommunication be with client device it is interactive or
Have ignored client device.For example, if client device 120 is laid down, the front panel of client device 120 downward, or
If ession for telecommunication, which is presented, in preview in equipment audio playback is arranged to mute, these can be user without and content interaction
Strong indicator.Similarly, the small movement of client device can indicate that user is presented ession for telecommunication in preview and continues
Equipment is hold, this may imply that higher interactive possibility.In some implementations, it sounds out and considers screen in preview
It is presented whether ession for telecommunication changes dispaly state.For example, if screen display waits for menu option input by user, and do not have
Change, then this may indicate that user without and content interaction.In some implementations, it sounds out and considers exit button (example
Such as, exit button 255) whether it is used to terminate preview presentation session ahead of time (however, termination does not necessarily mean that use ahead of time
Family is without interaction --- and user may complete the interaction with third party content before the period of distribution passes).As another
One example, if the volume of equipment audio playback is increased or not mute, these events may indicate that user is presented in preview
Ession for telecommunication is interactive with third party content.In some implementations, when client device is answered in the stage 370 back to first
Used time, client device provide information based on the assessment that interaction is soundd out to the first application.For example, in some implementations, visitor
Family end equipment provides the content interaction presented in state 330 and in interactive preview session with user to the first application
The probability or the corresponding value of possibility of (or without interaction).

The no branch 824 in presentation static screen；Whether stabilized screen (for example, cycle animation) is being presented based on judgement hosts applications
Branch 826；And the branch 828 of the time of predetermined limits whether is performed based on judgement hosts applications.These are examples, can be with
Using other judgement branches, and four illustrated are not intended to be restrictive.
Many judgement branch and cut algorithms use the analysis of screen capture.In some implementations, 570 period of host server
Property capture the figure exported from hosts applications image (" screen capture ") and analysis screen capture.In some realization methods
In, screen capture indicates that it may appear to that is if display screen exists, such as is emulated in fact based on client device
The graphic buffer of example.That is, screen capture not seek actual screen or interface is presented.In some implementations, shield
Curtain capture is the compression image of screen.In some implementations, screen capture is the subset for the screen for indicating screen state
Sampling.In some implementations, screen capture is with such as JPEG, GIF, BMP, PNG or the image of tiff image file format
File format is kept in memory.In some implementations, data corresponding with the state of screen are for display
The sampling of the pixel status of the subset of pixel.Sampling can be selected to the specific picture for the representative subset that full screen is shown
Element.In some implementations, the button.onrelease on client device (or event monitor) periodically carries out screen
It captures.The status information of pixel may include such as color value, tone, contrast, brightness, saturation degree etc..Color value can be
R-G-B (RGB) value, cyan-magenta-yellow-black-key (CMYK) value, the value " YCbCr " based on coloration or " Y'CbCr " value,
PANTONE values or the color value for using any other color valuing schemes.The set of the pixel used in sampling is the pre- of pixel
Fixed set.In some implementations, the set of pixel is initially randomly selected, but is made in the entire analysis of hosts applications
With identical pixel set.Screen capture can be indicated using load screen, video or media presentation, graphic user interface (GUI)
Or any other thing that hosts applications can be presented.
Using the branch 822 at the stage 820, whether host server 570 is being presented identification based on judgement hosts applications
User's input options judge that hosts applications arrived prompt point.In some implementations, host server 570 is periodically
