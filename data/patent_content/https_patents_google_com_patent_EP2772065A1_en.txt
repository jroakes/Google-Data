- Implementations disclosed herein can be used to associate media programs over the Internet.
- Such media programs such as video and audio programs, can be displayed on an Internet television (TV) or web TV, or with a smart TV system.
- TV Internet television
- web TV web TV
- Internet TV or web TV typically use a personal computer or a mobile device to stream or download media programs over the Internet.
- a smart TV module (or connected TV module, hybrid TV module, etc.) can integrate a conventional TV set with the Internet, and can bring a more integrated experience to users.
- a user can select desired content to view on the smart TV, play games over the Internet, browse web pages, etc., and may not necessarily discern whether the content is from broadcasting as in a conventional TV, or is from the Internet.
- the smart TV may include a processing circuit configured to integrate internet connectivity with more traditional TV programming sources (e.g., received via cable, satellite, over-the-air, or other signals).

- An input device such as a keyboard can be included to allow the user to input more lengthy commands as in a conventional personal computer.
- Media programs such as audio and video programs are more difficult to be correlated or quantified. Implementations disclosed herein allow similarities to be computed between media programs, such as TV programs, movies, series, shows, music, and other data, including non-textual data.
- a similarity is computed between two programs based on comparing available metadata about these programs.
- Example metadata may include, listing of cast, crew, program runtime, categories, genre, closed captions or subtitles, synopses, ratings, etc.
- the metadata can be obtained from web sources such as the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) or movie review web sites, Tribune Media Services (TMS), or other available sources.
- IMDb Internet Movie Database
- TMS Tribune Media Services
- the metadata may be available in various forms and may be organized into various fields.
- metadata from particular sources about a movie may include fields such as program title, description, storyline, cast, crew, genre, etc.
- metadata can be obtained from a web source, including fields such as title, main content, cast, categories, trivia, internal links to and from other articles within the same web source, and external links to other web sources.
- metadata about different programs can be obtained through internal links within the same web source, thereby providing a relatively uniform data source.
- external links may be included in the data association, though the data quality and format may be more heterogeneous, as the data are from a plurality of web sources/sites without a substantially uniform standard.
- data mining may be provided through a search engine and conducted throughout the world wide web (WWW).
- a method 200 of comparing two programs may be provided, as illustrated in the flowchart of FIG. 2.
- the method 200 may include the following operations.
- first metadata about a first media program and second metadata about a second media program may be received at a server for analysis using a processing circuit.
- the first and second programs may be two movies
- the first and second metadata may be correspondingly two articles/reviews about these two movies.
- Each of the metadata are organized into a plurality of fields, such as main content or main description, cast, production, storyline, soundtrack description, distribution, reception, box office performance, awards, etc.
- a plurality of tokens may be extracted from each field in the metadata of each program.
- a token may be the most frequently used terms.
- the text of each field may be recognized as single words, and/or phrases including two or more words. For example, two adjacent words "New” and “York” may be parsed as a phrase "New York,” and recognized as a token.
- each of the better known actors may be treated as a token.
- a first name and a last name may be combined into a single token.
- words may be combined into phrases if these words appear in the text together more than once, preferably more than a predetermined number of occasions.
- keywords can be globally converted into unique identifiers such as unique numbers, for a set of programs being analyzed.
- a numerical relevance factor may be given for each token indicating its level of relevance in calculating the program similarities.
- Main content of metadata sources e.g., descriptions of movies, such as those obtained from TMS or other sources
- Main content of metadata sources often contain a large amount of textual data, and can be divided into sentences, sentence terminals, and/or clusters.
- Terminals may be words occurring in the text, and/or words joined together if they form popular phrases. In one implementation, all terminals may be included as tokens. Their numerical relevance value may be given as 1, for example.
- Clusters may be groups of words that are thematically connected to the text. For example, the content of a movie description may be determined using word clusters.
- a word cluster may be a set of words that convey the same or similar ideas.
- a word cluster may be a set of synonyms, according to one implementation. Such a cluster may be used to identify movies devoted to the same topic, but use different terminology to do so.
- a word cluster may include words that have related, but different meanings.
- a characteristic of a textual description may be a set of different word clusters. For each cluster, a numerical value describing its degree of connection to the media program may also be given. In one example, those clusters with a numerical value above a certain threshold may be included as tokens.
- Program titles may not have sufficient text for grouping into sentences or phrases.
- the textual data from the titles can be divided (e.g., by whitespace) into individual words, and each word may be included as a token and given a relevance numerical value of 1, since titles are generally significant to the media programs.
- every item on the cast list (such as that obtained from TMS cast data) can become a token.
- the cast list may be organized according to significance.
- the leading actress' relevance score may be set to be 1.
- Other actors in the list can be given lower scores from the previous one, for example by a fixed factor.
- the tokenization may be performed using one or more processing circuit portions automatically through mathematical models.
- the mathematical models may include probabilistic topic models based on word clusters.
- a probabilistic topic model may be applied to TMS
- the probabilistic topic model can contain a large number (e.g., 12 million) of known terms and a large number (e.g., 1 million) of concepts, and probabilistic relations therebetween.
- the texts from the TMS "description” may be input to a generic topic model to be tokenized.
- the following metadata fields of a program are tokenized: title, description, cast, genre, and director. Every token may be assigned a numerical weight factor, such as between 0 and 1, to indicate its relevance to the program.
- the numerical weight factors may be used in the calculations described below.
- Another field in the metadata may be defined as a category provided by the source.
- each category is be passed through some predetermined rules for parsing. Some categories may be changed to broader categories and their weight factors may be adjusted. Some categories may be unmodified and given a weight factor of 1.
- Every token may be assigned a weight within a field. The weight may depend on its relevance and the total number of programs in which the token occurs. In some cases a token may occur multiple times within one field. According to one implementation, its weight factors is aggregated according to a sub-linear function. For example, the aggregated weight factor can be much smaller than the sum of individual relevance scores. In one implementation, tokens are not aggregated across different fields.
- less meaningful tokens may be removed as outliers. These outliers may include those tokens that occur overly frequently in a field or globally in the metadata.
- the number, or frequency, of occurrences of the tokens may indicate their contributions to relevance of the program.
- a modified TF-IDF (term frequency - inverse document frequency) method is adopted to compute the weight factors of the tokens, in an example operation 208.
- the TF may indicate a frequency of occurrences of a token within each field
- the IDF may indicate a frequency of occurrences of a token across different fields, such as in a whole document.
- TF term frequency
- a token's weight factor is based on the calculated TF and IDF, such as the multiplication of TF and IDF.
- each field is considered as a vector, whose z ' -th component can be the weight of token i (in a global index).
- This vector may be normalized to have a length of 1.
- the similarity between two fields may be indicated by a correlation between the two vectors, such as the dot product (or scalar product, inner product) of the two normalized vectors.
- the vectors in the multi-dimension space and the dot products therebetween merely are one type of mathematical representation of relationships or correlations between fields of multiple components (tokens). Other mathematical tools and formulae can be used to calculate such relationships.
- cross-correlations of the first and second tokens between the plurality of first fields and the plurality of second fields can be performed, and a similarity score between the first and second media programs can be based on the cross-correlations.
- a plurality of field vectors may be constructed for each program.
- Each field vector may represent a field and constructed based on the tokens extracted from the field and their weight factors.
- a field vector A may be constructed for the "cast" field for the first movie.
- the cast vector A may have components on three token axes, such as Token 1 representing the name of a first actor, Token 2 representing the name of a second actor, and Token 3 representing a third actor.
- a vector can have more or fewer components.
- a field vector B may be constructed for the "cast" field for the second movie, where Tokens 1 ', 2', and 3 ' represent three actors in the cast of the second movie.
- Token 1 and Token 1 ' indicate that the first actor is common in the two movies. Different actors are represented by orthogonal axes. Although the coordinate systems for field vectors A and B in the illustrative example in FIG. 3 are aligned, it is understandable to those of ordinary skill in the art that in many other cases the coordinate systems are completely orthogonal to each other in a multi-dimensional vector space, indicating that no common actors are in the two programs being compared.
- the vectors may be normalized using normalization factors for the two token lists.
- each vector may be normalized on its lengths, such as by dividing the vector using the norm of the vector.
- the normalization factor is modified by multiplying a power of one of more selected components to, for example, boost those vectors with more tokens, to promote shorter texts, and/or to promote certain tokens.
- the vectors may be normalized to a range of 0 ⁇ 1.
- a exponential power of 0 ⁇ 1 (such as 1/3) may be given to selected tokens, such as in the TF- IDF calculations.
- Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other normalizations may be used in the process.
- the dot-product of the two vectors A and B may be computed.
- the aligned axes for the field vectors A and B in FIG. 3 indicate that the dot- product will have a high value, indicating a high degree of similarities between the two movies (at least in terms of cast).
- the dot-products from all field pairs may be added to compute a similarity score.
- a plurality of settings may be included in the
- Such settings may include, for example, a matrix of weights (real numbers) representing how much comparison of tokens from various field types (including comparisons between same types) affect the final score, and proper TF and IDF functions to be used for each field type.
- the similarity between two programs may be based on the similarities of individual pairs of fields.
- a matrix is provided that defines score multipliers for all pairs of fields (many of them may equal to 0). For example, the
- “description” field of program X may be directly compared to the "description” field of program Y, and the corresponding matrix component may have a value of 1.
- the "description” may be partially compared with other fields such as the "title,” and the “storyline,” etc, and the corresponding matrix components are non-zero.
- the non-zero across-fields matrix components indicates that some degrees of field mixing in calculating the similarity scores may be useful. [0080] However, some field mixing is not useful for comparison calculations. The description generally cannot be compared with "genre,” and thus the corresponding matrix components may be just 0.
- [M] An example matrix [M] is shown in FIG. 3, in which the numerical values of the matrix components is derived by testing various combinations to optimize the results in a statistical sampling process or given empirically.
- [M] may be a symmetric matrix.
- the final similarity score between two media programs is calculated with a global sum using proper across-fields weights in a form of a matrix similar to that illustrated in FIG. 3.
- the tokens can be mixed according to such a pre-defined matrix of weights for each pair of field types. Similarities between different fields may thus be factored into the calculations.
- adjustment/normalizations are applied to computing TF and IDF.
- the TF-IDF methods may be applied to program-related metadata, adjusting token extraction and mixing results appropriately for different types of text (e.g.
- a bonus score is given for every pair of fields that have a positive similarity score, e.g., having at least one token in common.
- the implementations disclosed herein may be used, for example, for determining related programs as part of a smart TV platform illustrated in FIG. 1.

- all programs related to a program may be found by computing the program's similarity scores to all programs in the database in an operation 504. The programs with highest scores may be returned, and ranked according to the similarity scores in an operation 506.
- the related programs may be displayed in an order according to their ranking along the requested program.
- the movies recommended according to the implementations disclosed herein may be more accurately reflecting the user's interest as compared with, e.g., collaborative filtering techniques used by some vendors (e.g., Amazon, Netf ix).
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating an example method 600 of predicting popularity of a program.
- the server may receive a star rating given by a user on a program (e.g., a number of stars or other ranking given by a user based on how much the user liked or disliked the program, such as one through five stars).
- the user may opt out of data collection, or may optionally provide additional data, such as demographic data that may be useful for recommending programs to the user.
- the user IDs associated with the rating or other user data are anonymized and not connected with user names.
- the server can predict the user's ratings on all similar programs which the user has not seen, using the computation methods described above.
- the statistics of the predicted ratings can be performed on a sample of users.
