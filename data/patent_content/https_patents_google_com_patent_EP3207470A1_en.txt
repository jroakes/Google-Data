- the search system 120 provides search results 134 that are responsive to the revised query 132 to the assistive browsing system 130.
- a search result 136 is automatically selected from among the plurality of search results 134, and instructions 138 are provided to the user device 106.
- the instructions are executed, e.g., by a web browser, to display the resource represented by the selected search result on the user device 106.
- Implementations of the present disclosure are generally directed to automatically selecting a search result responsive to a query based on context provided from a resource, and navigating to a resource represented by the search result. More particularly, implementations of the present disclosure are directed to using context data associated with a first resource displayed to a user at a time of a query, e.g., when the query was sent, or when the query was received, selecting a search result based on the query and a context of the first resource, and displaying a second resource represented by the search result to the user.

- the search result is selected from the plurality of search results.
- instructions are provided that, when executed, cause the second resource to be displayed to the user.
- the instructions can provide that a URL assigned to the second resource is to be automatically input to an address bar of a web browser, to prompt the web browser to retrieve and display the second resource.
- a user submits a query while viewing a first resource displayed on a user device, e.g., by entering the query in an address bar of a web browser.
- the user can submit a query while viewing a particular webpage, e.g., first resource, displayed in a web browser executed by the user device.
- the query is related to an aspect of the first resource that the user is viewing. For example, the user may desire to learn more about a topic mentioned in the particular webpage (first resource), but not described in detail. Consequently, the user's query can be directed to that topic.
- context data related to the first resource can be obtained.
- the context data can be provided from the user device.
- the user device can provide context data that can include content of the first resource that is displayed to the user when submitting the query. That is, for example the user device transmits the query and context data, e.g., to the search system 120.
- context data is retrieved.
- the URL of the first resource can be submitted with the query, e.g., to the search system 120.
- the search system and/or as assistive browsing system e.g., the assistive browsing system, can retrieve the first resource using the URL, and can obtain context data (content) from the first resource.
- a revised query is provided based on the query and the context data.
- the query and the context data are provided to a query rewrite system, which provides the revised query based on one or more terms of the original query and the context data.
- the search system obtains search results based on the revised query, the search results being responsive to the revised query.
- the search system can use the revised query as input to a search index, e.g., the search index 122, which provides the search results in response.
- a search result is automatically, e.g., without requiring user selection or intervention, selected from the search results.
- the assistive browsing system can select a search result from the search results.
- the search result represents a second resource, e.g., a webpage.
- the second resource is displayed to the user.
- instructions can be transmitted to the user device, and can include instructions to input a URL assigned to the second resource into an address bar of a web browser.
- the user device can executed the instructions such that the second resource is automatically displayed on the user device.
- a query can include a textual query, e.g., one or more terms typed into a search bar or address bar of a web browser.
- a search query also can include a voice query, e.g., one or more terms spoken into a user device, such as a smartphone.
- a query can be spoken or entered using conversational language, e.g., by implicitly referring to conventional information displayed to the user.
- a query can include a one or more terms phrased as a command, e.g., "show me arrival times" submitted while a user is viewing an airline's webpage.
- a user device may recognize a query as a contextual query based on the terms used in the query. And, in some implementations, a user may provide a positive indication that a query is contextual query, e.g., a user selectable control or a contextual search toolbar may be used to designate a query as a contextual query.
- the context data can be obtained by the user device.
- the context data can include any appropriate data associated with and/or provided in a resource displayed, e.g., a webpage displayed in an active web browser window, on the user device at a time of the query, and can include, for example, displayable text, images, metadata, code, e.g., HTML code, the URL of the resource or portions thereof, e.g., the web domain or website that hosts the resource, and/or hyperlinks to other resources.
- the context data may be obtained from a portion of or from the entire resource. In some examples, the context data may be obtained only from a particular portion or particular portions of the resource.
- a user is viewing a webpage including a long written article that includes portions of text not displayed on the user device.
- the user device may track the portions of text that the user views and only extract textual context data from those previously viewed portions of the webpage.
- portions of the webpage which the user has not viewed, and therefore, presumably has not read will not be used as context data, and consequently, will not be considered in creating a revised query.
- the query rewrite system may be included as a part of a search system or may be a separate system communicably coupled to the search system, e.g., directly or via one or more networks.
- a user device may send a query and context data to the search system, and the search system may then provide the query and context data to the query rewrite system to obtain a revised query.
- user devices also may be communicably coupled to the query rewrite system, e.g., by one or more networks. In such implementations, a user device may send a query and context data to the query rewrite system to obtain a revised query, and then submit the revised query to the search system.
- a revised query may include a modified version of the user submitted query.
- modifications may include, for example, incorporating context data into the terms of the user submitted query, replacing one or more terms of the user submitted query with context data, rearranging terms of the user submitted query, rephrasing or paraphrasing the user submitted query based on context data, or any combination of the preceding.
- a user submit a query [what are his memoirs about], while viewing a webpage about Barack Obama.
- the query rewrite system may recognize, based on context data associated with the webpage, e.g., webpage text, that the pronoun "his" in the query refers to Barack Obama, and hence, may provide a revised query such as, e.g., [what are Barack Obama' s memoirs about] to the search system and/or to the user device.
- context data used to modify a search need not be related to the main topic of a web resource, as was the case in the previous example.
- a user may be viewing a webpage about Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant and submit the query [when is the next game].
- the query rewrite system may recognize, based on context data associated with the webpage, e.g., webpage text, metadata, and/or URL, that the query refers to the Los Angeles Lakers, and thus, may provide a revised query such as, e.g., [when is the Laker's next game] or [Lakers schedule] to the search system and/or to the user device.
- the revised query also may be based on search history data.
- the search history data may include data related to searches performed by the user performing the search or multiple users.
- the search history data can be statistical data related to consecutive search patterns.
- the data may describe common search patterns, e.g., after users read about topic A they typically search for topic B.
- the search system may obtain a plurality of search results responsive to the revised query.
- the search results may include additional information pertaining to the search results and/or resources identified by the search results including, for example, resource metadata, resource prominence, resource quality, search result click history, and search result scores.
- search results in the plurality of search results may be ranked, e.g., based on scores associated with respective search results.
- the search system and/or the assistive browsing system can process the search results and associated information to automatically, e.g., without requiring user action, select a relevant search result representing a resource that will be displayed to the user.
- the search result selected may be a search result identifying a resource that originates from the same domain, e.g., website domain, as the resource that was being displayed to the user when the user submitted the query (the "first resource").
- a search result of two or more search results that has the highest score may be selected.
- a search result of two or more search results may be selected based on context data from the resource being displayed when the user submitted the query, e.g., whether the resource includes a hyperlink to any of the two or more search results.
- the search system and/or the assistive browsing system may re-rank the search results based on the context data.
- search results identifying other resources indicating some relationship, e.g., based on the additional search information or the context data, to the first resource may be weighted more heavily. For example, such a relationship may include whether a resource originates from the same website as the first resource, whether the displayed resource includes a hyperlink to a resource, whether a resource has the same author as the first resource.
- a search result is automatically selected based on the new ranking, e.g., the top re-ranked search result is selected.
- a resource identified by the selected result may be provided to the user device for display to the user.
- the second resource may be automatically displayed on the user device in response to submission of the query.
- the second resource may be displayed in a web browser executed by the user device.
- the second resource is displayed in the same window as the first resource, thereby "replacing" the first resource, e.g., the previously displayed first resource is replaced in the web browser window with the second resource.
- the second resource may be displayed as an overlay overlapping the first resource.
- a new web browser tab may be opened and the second resource is displayed within the new web browser tab.
- FIGs. 2A-2C depict an example use case in accordance with implementations of the present disclosure.
- the series of FIGs. 2A-2C provide an illustrative example of processes in accordance with implementations of the present disclosure.
- the example use case of FIGs. 2A-2C include an encyclopedic webpage about Barack Obama being displayed on a user device, and, while the webpage is displayed, the user searches for information about Barack Obama's memoirs entitled "Dreams from My Father.”
- FIGs. 2A-2C depict an example graphical user interface (GUI) 200 in accordance with implementations of the present disclosure.
- GUI 200 is an example web browser displayed on a user device (e.g., such as user device 106).
- GUI 200 includes an address bar 202 and a resource display portion 204.
- a Wikipedia webpage (a first resource) about Barack Obama is displayed in the resource display portion 204.
- a user can enter the query 206 [what are his memoirs about] in the address bar 202.
- a user device may recognize a query as a contextual search based on the terms used in the query.
- the GUI 200 may include a user selectable control 208, which may be used to designate a query as a contextual search.
- a web browser may include a contextual search toolbar.
- the query is sent to a search system, e.g., the search system 120, and context data associated with the webpage is obtained, e.g., provided from the user device, retrieved by the search system 120 and/or the assistive browser system 130, as described herein.
- a revised query is provided, e.g., from the query rewrite system 140, based on the query 206 and the context data.
- the query rewrite system may return a revised query of [what are Barack Obama's memoirs about] based on the query 206 and context data of the displayed resource.
- Example search results obtained based on the revised query [what are Barack Obama's memoirs about] may include:
- a search result is automatically selected from the plurality of search results based on the context data associated with the displayed webpage.
- the user device automatically selects the search result Dreams from My Father - Wikipedia (a second resource), e.g., because it identifies another webpage from the same website as the first resource.
- search results that are responsive to the revised query may represent a diverse range of information related to the user's search topic. Consequently, using the context data from the first resource may advantageously limit the scope of relevant search results to those search results that are aligned with the intentions of the user in submitting the query. For example, in the example of FIG. 2A, the user was reading an educational article about Barack Obama on an Internet-provided encyclopedia website. Therefore, the user is likely interested in educational works about Barack Obama's memoirs and not opinion or news articles. Thus, in this example, choosing the search result from the same website is likely more in keeping with the user's intentions.
- the example search results list two results from the Wikipedia website, Dreams from My Father - Wikipedia and The Audacity of Hope - Wikipedia.
- additional context data may be used to select between two such results.
- the text of the Barack Obama Wikipedia webpage may identify "Dreams from My Father” as Barack Obama's memoir, and this data may be used to distinguish the results.
- the corresponding resource is automatically displayed to the user.
- the Dreams from My Father Wikipedia webpage replaces the Barack Obama webpage in the display portion 204 of GUI 200.
- the plurality of search results are not presented to the user for user selection of a search result.
- the second resource represented by the automatically selected search result, is displayed within GUI 200. Consequently, a user may enter plain language queries while reviewing a web resource and receive another relevant web resource without having to review a plurality of search results and having to select a search result.
- the resource identified by the selected search result may be presented to the user in an overlay 210 providing the user with an opportunity to confirm the selected search result.
- the overlay 210 the Barack Obama Wikipedia webpage may then be replaced by Dreams from My Father Wikipedia webpage in the display portion 204 of GUI 200.
- a user be permitted to effortlessly search a topic tangential to a displayed resource, review a resource on the tangential topic, and then continue reviewing the displayed resource.
- such implementations may include one or more user selectable input 212 to permit the user to cycle through search results.
- FIG. 3 depicts an example process 300 that can be executed in accordance with implementations of the present disclosure.
- the example process 300 can be
- example process 300 can be provided by one or more computer-executable programs executed using one or more computing devices.
- a query provided by a user and including one or more terms is received (310).
- a user may submit a query including one or more terms into a search bar or address bar of a web browser on a user device.
- the user can submit a query while viewing a particular webpage, e.g., first resource, displayed in a web browser executed by the user device.
- the computing device may receive a spoken query from a user, e.g., using a microphone and speech-to-text conversion capabilities of the user device.
- the user device may then send the query to a search system, e.g., search system 120 and/or assistive browsing system 130.
- the context data can be provided from the user device.
- the user device can provide context data that can include content of the first resource that is displayed to the user when submitting the query. That is, for example the user device transmits the query and context data, e.g., to the search system 120.
- context data is retrieved.
- the URL of the first resource can be submitted with the query, e.g., to the search system 120.
- the search system and/or as assistive browsing system e.g., the assistive browsing system, can retrieve the first resource using the URL, and can obtain context data (content) from the first resource.
- the context data may be obtained from a portion of or from the entire first resource. In some examples, the context data may be obtained only from a particular portion or particular portions of the first resource.
- a revised query that is based on the query and the context data is obtained (330).
- the query and the context data are provided to a query rewrite system, which provides the revised query based on one or more terms of the original query and the context data.
- a revised query can be obtained by providing the query and the context data to a query revision engine, and receiving the revised query from the query revision engine.
- the plurality of search results responsive to the revised query are then received (340).
- the search system can use the revised query as input to a search index, e.g., a search index, which provides the search results in response.
- a search result identifying a second resource is automatically selected (350). For example, an assistive browsing system or user device can automatically, e.g., without requiring user selection or intervention, select a particular one of the plurality of search results.
- the search result may be selected based on the context data associated with the first resource.
- the search result represents a second resource, e.g., a webpage.
- the second resource is automatically, e.g., without requiring user intervention, provided for display to the user (360), e.g. , the second resource can be displayed by a web browser executed by a user device. That is, from the user perspective, the second resource is automatically displayed without further user input after the user submits the query (e.g., in step 310).
- instructions can be transmitted to the user device, and can include instructions to input a URL assigned to the second resource into an address bar of a web browser.
- the user device can executed the instructions such that the second resource is automatically displayed on the user device.
- the instructions may include instructions to cause a web browser to open a tab and display the second resource in the tab.
- the search result is selected at least partially in response to determining that a domain from which the second resource originates is the domain from which the first resource originates.
- the search result website is selected at least partially in response to determining that the first resource includes a link to the second resource.
- the first resource and the second resource may be respective webpages.
- Various implementations described herein may provide advantages including reducing the bandwidth and computing resources required to perform searches by a computing device. For example, a user may submit a query and directly have a relevant resource displayed to the user web browser without having to perform the task of selecting a particular search result from a search result page.
- process 300 may eliminate the need to perform computing tasks such as the transmission of data related to a plurality of search results in a search result page between a server and a computing device, the transmission of the user selection of one of the search results between the server and the computing device, and the subsequent retrieval of the selected search server to the computing device. Instead, a relevant resource is directly displayed to a user in response to the user's query.
