Definitions
- the invention relates to a cellular communication system employing a plurality of bandwidths.
- 3GPP 3 rd Generation Partnership Project
- UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunication System
- LTE Long Term Evolution
- LTE is an example of a cellular communication system which employs a plurality of different bandwidths.
- LTE is an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) cellular communication system where the individual OFDM subcarriers have a fixed bandwidth and a different number of subcarriers is used for different bandwidths.
- OFDM Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex
- LTE supports operation with a bandwidth of 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, 5 MHz, 10 MHz and 20 MHz with 72, 144, 288, 600 and 1200 active 15 kHz subcarriers respectively (the remaining subcarriers are used as a guard band).
- the base stations transmit reference signals containing cell-specific reference sequences.
- the reference signal and sequence is used by the user equipments to detect the presence of specific base stations.
- the base stations transmit broadcast control channels (BCH) that among other things include data identifying the specific bandwidth used by the base station transmitting the broadcast control channel.
- BCH broadcast control channels
- a user equipment When a user equipment (UE) is switched on it proceeds to search for available base stations. This initial search is based on the user equipment trying to detect the presence of any reference signals and sequences and on the decoding of broadcast control channels for any detected reference signals.
- the initial cell-search process must be performed without the user equipment having any information of which bandwidths are actually used by the base stations.
- the user equipment may specifically perform the entire cell search process based on only on the narrowest bandwidth, i.e. it may exclusively use signals within a 1.25 MHz window for all the steps of the initial cell search regardless of the actual bandwidth used by the present base stations.
- This approach relies on the broadcast control channel for higher bandwidths being limited to a 1.25 MHz window corresponding to the narrowest bandwidth in use.
- the reference sequences In order to ensure a robust and high performance cell search based on the reference signals and sequences, it is important that the reference sequences have properties which are particularly suitable for detection and estimation. Accordingly, the reference sequences should be selected as sequences that have strong auto correlation and cross correlation properties.
- GCL sequences have a number of attractive qualities that make them particularly suitable for use as reference sequences in systems such as LTE. Specifically, GCL sequences have very good auto-correlation properties and cross correlation properties between different GCL sequences of the same length. In addition, GCL sequences have constant amplitude thereby making them suitable for transmission as part of a reference signal.
- GCL sequences may be found in e.g. United States of America patent application US2005/0226140 A1.
- LTE In systems such as LTE, the number of symbols in the reference sequence depends on the bandwidth used. Specifically, LTE employs a frame structure comprising 7 time slots with the reference signal being transmitted in the first time slot which has every sixth subcarrier allocated for transmission of a reference signal symbol. Thus, LTE has 12, 24, 48, 200 and 200 reference signal subcarriers or reference sequence symbols for the respective bandwidths of 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, 5 MHz, 10 MHz and 20 MHz.
- an improved cellular communication system would be advantageous and in particular a system allowing increased flexibility, reduced complexity, reduced resource demand, reduced cell search/detection/acquisition delay, improved suitability for operation with different bandwidths and/or improved performance would be advantageous.
- the Invention seeks to preferably mitigate, alleviate or eliminate one or more of the above mentioned disadvantages singly or in any combination.
- a cellular communication system employing a plurality of bandwidths, the cellular communication system comprising: a plurality of base stations, each base station being arranged to transmit a reference signal comprising a Generalised Chirp-Like, GCL, sequence, a length of the GCL sequence being dependent on a bandwidth employed by the base station;
- GCL Generalised Chirp-Like
- sequence means for providing a first subset of GCL sequences for a first bandwidth, the first subset comprising GCL sequences selected from a set of possible GCL sequences for the first bandwidth in response to properties of a sub-sequence of the GCL sequences of the set of possible GCL sequences, the sub-sequence having a length corresponding to a different bandwidth than the first bandwidth; and selection means for selecting a first GCL sequence for a first base station of the plurality of base stations employing the first bandwidth from the first subset of GCL sequences.
- the invention may allow improved use of GCL sequences in systems employing a plurality of bandwidths.
- An improved cell search, detection and/or acquisition performance may be achieved.
- the use of GCL sequences may allow improved performance relative to other sequences as the advantageous properties of GCL sequences can be exploited.
- the invention may in many embodiments allow simplified and/or improved cell detection/search operation based on detection/search in only a subset of the first bandwidth (e.g. in only the second bandwidth) and/or for only a subset of sequences and/or sub-sequences.
- the invention may reduce or eliminate the need for searching for all possible GCL sequences.
- a GCL search/detection operation may be based on only a subset of possible GCL sequences.
- the invention exploits specific properties of GCL sequence subsets and/or sub-sequences to provide improved and/or facilitated multiple bandwidth operation.
- the system may employ the plurality of bandwidths by allowing different base stations to have frequency bands of different bandwidths allocated to support communications from user equipments.
- the frequency band allocated to a base station may be divided into number of contiguous OFDM subcarriers which are all available to the base station.
- Base stations using different bandwidths may have different numbers of subcarriers.
- the cellular communication system may specifically use OFDM with a fixed subcarrier bandwidth and a varying number of subcarriers corresponding to different bandwidths.
- sequence lengths may depend on the bandwidth with which they are associated. In particular, sequences for narrower bandwidths may be shorter than sequences for wider bandwidths and e.g. the sequence length of the GCL sequences may be approximately proportional to the bandwidth. Specifically, in some embodiments, bandwidths of 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, 5 MHz, 10 MHz and 20 MHz may have associated (truncated) GCL sequence lengths of 12, 24, 48, 200 and 200 elements respectively.
- the GCL sequences may be truncated GCL sequences.
- a GCL sequence may be a subsection of a longer GCL sequence for a different bandwidth.
- GCL sequences for shorter bandwidths may be truncated GCL sequences for higher bandwidths.
- the different lengths for the GCL sequences of different bandwidths may be achieved by a different truncation of a GCL sequence.
- transmitting different length GCL sequences may include transmitting sequences obtained by truncating the same GCL sequence to different lengths.
- the second bandwidth may specifically be narrower than the first bandwidth.
- a method of operation for a cellular communication system employing a plurality of bandwidths comprising: a plurality of base stations transmitting a reference signal comprising a GCL sequence, a length of the GCL sequence being dependent on a bandwidth employed by the base station; providing a first subset of GCL sequences for a first bandwidth, the first subset comprising GCL sequences selected from a set of possible GCL sequences for the first bandwidth in response to properties of a sub-sequence of the GCL sequences of the set of possible GCL sequences, the sub-sequence having a length corresponding to a different bandwidth than the first bandwidth; and selecting a first GCL sequence for a first base station of the plurality of base stations employing the first bandwidth from the first subset of GCL sequences.

- the cellular communication system may be a Long Term Evolution-Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (LTE-UMTS).
- LTE-UMTS Long Term Evolution-Universal Mobile Telecommunication System
- the described principles are not limited to this specific application but may be applied to many other cellular communication systems.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example of a cellular communication system in accordance with some embodiments of the invention.
- the system comprises a plurality of base stations of which two base stations 101 , 103 are shown.
- Each of the base stations 101 , 103 support User Equipments (UEs) within a given cell and communicate with the UEs via air interface communication channels.
- UE User Equipments
- a UE may be any communication entity capable of communication with the base stations over the air interface.
- the system is a multiple bandwidth system wherein the base stations may use different bandwidths.
- each of the base stations 101 , 103 may employ a bandwidth of 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, 5 MHz, 10 MHz or 20 MHz.
- the base stations 101 , 103 use an OFDM communication scheme and the bandwidth of the base station is divided into a number of subcarriers.
- all base stations use OFDM subcarriers having a fixed bandwidth of 15 kHz.
- the number of OFDM subcarriers for a specific cell depends on the bandwidth, and generally a doubling of the bandwidth approximately corresponds to a doubling of the number of available subcarriers (as some subcarriers are used as guard bands this relation only holds approximately).
- the different bandwidths correspond to 72, 144, 288, 600 and 1200 subcarriers respectively.
- 18 MHz (1200 ⁇ 15 kHz) are used for active communications with the extra 2 MHz being reserved for guard bands.
- a known reference signal sequence is transmitted which can be detected by the UEs.
- a UE When a UE is switched on, it searches for the presence of reference signal sequences to determine whether any base stations are present. If a sequence is detected, the UE proceeds to decode a broadcast control channel transmitted by the base station.
- the initial search and detection of the reference signal sequence and the decoding of the broadcast control channel is in e.g. LTE performed without knowledge of the actual bandwidth of the base station.
- the information of the actual bandwidth employed is included in the broadcast control data of the broadcast control channel and following the decoding of this channel, the UE can proceed to use the identified bandwidth.
- the bandwidth of the broadcast control channel is for all bandwidths set to correspond to the lowest available bandwidth. Thus, broadcast control data is only transmitted in subcarriers which are present for all bandwidths, i.e. which fall within the 1.25 MHz bandwidth.
- the base stations 101 , 103 transmit a reference signal which can be used by UEs to detect the individual cells and base stations 101 , 103 .
- the base stations 101 , 103 transmit the elements or symbols of the reference signal sequence as a simultaneous transmission the elements in different frequency subcarriers of the first frequency band.
- a number of subcarriers are reserved for the elements/symbols of the reference signal sequence.
- every sixth subcarrier is allocated to transmitting the sequence.
- a sequence of known data is distributed in the subcarrier domain.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example of the distribution of the sequence in a subcarrier domain.
- some elements of a sequence may be transmitted sequentially.
- a reference signal sequence may be distributed over a plurality of time slots.
- the reference signal sequence is not only used for detection of a base station but is also used to identify the detected base station. Specifically, the reference signal sequence depends on the cell identity allocated to the base station. Thus, by detecting a specific sequence, the UE will also identify a specific cell identity.
- the reference signal sequences used should have strong auto correlation and cross correlation properties. Furthermore, the sequences should preferably have substantially constant amplitude.
- GCL sequences have been proposed for LTE because these sequences have attractive properties including advantageous auto correlation, cross correlation and amplitude properties.
- the GCL sequences may be determined from the equation:
- GCL sequences are limited to specific lengths. Specifically, the length N G of a GCL sequence given by the above equation is limited to lengths corresponding to prime numbers.
- N G For a sequence of length N G there are N G different sequences with strong cross correlation properties.
- N G For a sequence length of N G , a set of N G GCL sequences exist that may be allocated to the base stations.
- the properties of the GCL sequences are only guaranteed within the set and there is no guarantee that two GCL sequences of different lengths have strong cross-correlation properties.
- the number of elements or symbols in the transmitted reference signal sequence depends on the employed bandwidth. As every sixth subcarrier is allocated to the sequence, the sequence lengths are 12, 24, 48, 100 and 200 elements for the bandwidths 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, 5 MHz, 10 MHz and 20 MHz respectively.
- reference signal sequences for a given bandwidth are selected from the set of GCL sequences having a length corresponding to the next higher prime number. This sequence may then be truncated to match the available number of subcarriers.
- the number of total subcarriers N C , reference signal subcarriers N p , and corresponding basic sequence length N G is given in the following table:
- the UEs may need to detect and decode the reference signal sequence without any information of the bandwidth employed by the base station.
- the UE is expected to search for all possible sequences for all possible bandwidths. This introduces substantial delay, complexity and resource usage.
- base stations using different bandwidths interfere with each other, the poor cross correlation properties will substantially reduce performance.
- the base stations 101 , 103 are coupled to a sequence generator 105 which provides a first subset of GCL sequences for a first frequency.
- the GCL sequences have to a GCL sequence length as indicated by the table above.
- the sequences are selected from a set of possible GCL sequences for the first bandwidth in response to properties of a sub-sequence of sequences of the set of possible GCL sequences.
- a subset of sequences of a given length is selected from the set of possible sequences of that length.
- the sub-sequence is selected such that it has a length that corresponds to a GCL sequence length for one of the other frequencies.
- the GCL sequences may be truncated GCL sequences.
- the sequence generator 105 determines a subset of GCL sequences out of the possible GCL sequences for the highest bandwidth depending on properties of sub-sequences of these sequences.
- the sub-sequences may specifically correspond to sequences which fall within the lower bandwidths.
- a subset of truncated GCL sequences of length 200 may be selected from all the possible truncated GCL sequences of length 200 based on the properties of the elements which will be transmitted in the subcarriers falling within the band that would also have been used by the base station if this had employed a 1.25 MHz bandwidth.
- the sequence generator 105 generates 211 GCL sequences of length 211. It then proceeds to select a subset of 12 of these GCL sequences. The 12 GCL sequences are then truncated to 200 elements.
- the base stations 101 , 103 of the system which employ a bandwidth of 20 MHz will subsequently select a reference signal sequence from the subset comprising the 12 truncated GCL sequences.
- the selection of the 12 truncated GCL sequences depends on characteristics of a sub-sequence of the 211 sequences. Specifically, the sub-sequences may be selected as the elements which are transmitted in the subcarriers which would also be transmitted in lower bandwidths and specifically the sub-sequences may be the sub-sequence of elements that would be transmitted in the subcarriers of the lowest 1.25 MHz bandwidth.
- the sequence generator 105 specifically selects the 12 sequences such that the cross correlation properties for the sub-sequences are advantageous.
- a cross correlation taking into account only the elements of the subcarriers which coincide with the 1.25 MHz would also be low and preferably would be minimised for the selected subset.
- the sequence generator 105 may select the 12 sequences such that the auto correlation properties for the sub-sequences are advantageous.
- the sequence generator 105 may select the 12 GCL sequences for which the sub-sequences of the 12 elements transmitted in the subcarriers of the 1.25 MHz bandwidth most closely resemble the GCL sequences for the reference signal sequence length of the 1.25 MHz bandwidth.
- the sequence generator 105 generates a subset of (truncated) GCL sequences from which the base stations 101 , 103 may select a specific sequence to use.
- the selected set of sequences is fed from the sequence generator 105 to the base stations 101 , 103 .
- Each of the base stations 101 , 103 is coupled to a sequence processor 107 , 109 which selects a specific GCL sequence for the individual base station 101 , 103 from the subset of GCL sequences. Specifically, based on the cell identity assigned to the base stations 101 , 103 , the sequence processors 107 , 109 will select the sequence as the sequence which is linked to the cell identity.
- the (sub)set of GCL sequences for a given bandwidth may be finally determined during the design phase of the system.
- the linking between cell identity and specific sequence may be determined during the design phase. For example, for each cell identity, Technical Specifications may be standardised which identifies a specific reference signal sequence for each bandwidth and each cell identity.
- each base station 101 , 103 may comprise internal means that provides the linking between a cell identity and an associated (truncated) GCL sequence for each bandwidth.
- the subset of GCL sequences may e.g. be provided simply by retrieving the GCL sequences from a look-up table locally stored in the base station.
- each base station may simply retrieve the corresponding (truncated) GCL sequence from the look up table and start transmitting this in the appropriate subcarriers for the reference signal.
- the GCL sequences for each bandwidth are selected as GCL sequences of the length corresponding to the specific bandwidth and specifically the GCL sequences are determined by a possible truncation of GCL sequences with a length equal to the first prime number equal to larger than the number of available subcarriers.
- GCL sequences of higher bandwidths are selected such that the elements falling within a lower bandwidth are similar to at least one of the sequences in the lower bandwidth.
- a set of 12 GCL sequences is selected and the sequences are selected such that the sets are similar for the overlapping elements.
- any suitable similarity criterion may be selected and specifically a similarity criterion may be that a cross correlation value between the elements of the sub-sequence and the elements of the corresponding elements of sequences at the lower bandwidths is below a given threshold for all sequences of the lower bandwidth except for one and that the cross correlation for this sequence is above a given threshold.
- a set of GCL sequences for each of the bandwidths is selected from the set of GCL sequences given by:
- GCL sequences derived from the GCL sequences with a length equal to or immediately higher than the reference signal sequence length.
- a set of GCL sequences are selected such that these sequences have sub-sequences which resemble shorter GCL sequences used for lower bandwidths.
- the set of sequences for each bandwidth comprises the sequences with the following indexes:
- u BW1 is a GCL sequence index for the bandwidth
- u BWmin is a GCL sequence index for a minimum bandwidth (i.e. the 1.25 MHz bandwidth in the specific example)
- N G,BW1 is a GCL sequence length for the bandwidth
- N G,BW1 is a sequence length for the minimum bandwidth (i.e. 13 in the specific example).
- the above equation defines a set of 12 GCL sequences for each of the possible bandwidths. Furthermore, the sets are selected such that cross correlation properties between GCL sequences of different lengths are still advantageous (i.e. they are reduced/minimized for all sequences except the sequence at the lower bandwidth allocated to the same cell identity).
- the individual base station 101 , 103 accordingly selects a specific GCL sequence from the set of 12 sequences defined for the specific bandwidth used by the base station.
- the selection is based on the cell identity allocated to the base station and specifically each of the 12 sequences are linked to a specific cell identity.
- the allocation of the individual elements of the selected GCL sequence to the subcarriers is furthermore performed such that the GCL sequences of different bandwidths are aligned thereby ensuring that the sub-sequence of the longer GCL sequences are aligned with the shorter GCL sequences.
- the lower bandwidths are subbands of the higher bandwidths.
- the 20 MHz bandwidth completely encompasses the other bandwidths and specifically the 1.25 MHz bandwidth.
- all bandwidths are centred on the carrier frequency of the base station.
- the base station uses a 20 MHz bandwidth, this will extend by ⁇ 10 Mhz on either side of the carrier frequency.
- the base station uses a 10 MHz bandwidth, this will extend by ⁇ 5 Mhz on either side of the carrier frequency etc.
- the elements of the GCL sequences are allocated to the specific subcarriers such that the sequence is aligned with an alignment frequency.
- This, frequency is a frequency which also falls within the lower bandwidths and may specifically be the central frequency or carrier frequency allocated to the base station.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a specific example of an allocation of element numbers along the subcarrier domain for different bandwidths.
- the next elements of the sequence are allocated to the subsequent subcarriers until the end of the frequency band is reached.
- BW BW
- the last element of the GCL sequences is allocated to a subcarrier being the closest subcarrier to the subcarrier having the first element of the first GCL sequence allocated (in the appropriate direction).
- the elements with decreasing indices are then allocated to subcarriers in the direction towards lower frequencies.
- the sub-sequences within the lowest bandwidth (1.25 MHz) of any of employed GCL sequences will be one that has attractive cross-correlation properties with respect to any other GCL sequence or sub-sequence within this bandwidth.
- the approach exploits specific properties of GCL sequences and sub-sequences to provide a set of GCL sequences for different bandwidths (and thus with different lengths) while maintaining advantageous properties between the sequences.
- the described approach for selecting GCL sequences may substantially improve and/or facilitate operation and performance in a multiple bandwidth cellular communication system.
- a UE may perform the initial search and detection based only on GCL sequences which have a length of the lowest bandwidth although the base stations which are to be detected may use higher bandwidths and longer sequences.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example of a UE in accordance with such an example.
- the UE comprises a receive front-end 401 which performs filtering, amplification, down-conversion etc as well known to the skilled person.
- the receive front-end 401 is coupled to a detection processor 403 which is arranged to detect a presence of the first GCL sequence in response to a comparison between the received signal and a second GCL sequence associated with a different bandwidth.
- the second GCL sequence has fewer elements than the first GCL sequence.
- the detection processor 403 is coupled to a sequence store 405 which comprises the GCL sequence set for each possible bandwidth. However, the detection processor 403 retrieves only the GCL sequences for the narrowest bandwidth and only uses these sequences to search for the presence of GCL sequences whether these are associated with the narrowest bandwidth or with higher bandwidths.
- the detection processor 403 may detect a 200 element long GCL sequence in a 20 MHz bandwidth based on a comparison with a locally stored 12 element long sequence corresponding to the 1.25 MHz bandwidth. Specifically, the detection processor 403 can sequentially or in parallel perform a correlation of the received signal in the 12 reference signal subcarriers of the 1.25 MHz bandwidth and the 12 GCL sequences defined for the 1.25 MHz bandwidth.
- the selected GCL sequences allows the UE to perform a reliable detection of base stations without knowing the bandwidths used by the individual base station and while only monitoring a set of GCL sequences specified for the lowest bandwidth.
- the detection processor 403 merely monitors and searches for 12 reference signal sequences.
- the detection processor 403 is coupled to a broadcast processor 407 which is arranged to receive the broadcast control channel transmitted by the detected base station.
- the broadcast processor 407 first determines a propagation channel estimate for the propagation channel between the base station and the UE.
- the channel estimate is generated based on a comparison between the received signal and the GCL sequence of the narrowest bandwidth.
- an accurate local replica of the reference signal sequence is used to determine the channel estimate.
- the local replica of the reference signal sequence used to determine the channel estimate is only an approximate replica of the actual sequence in subcarriers falling in the 1.25 MHz bandwidth. Although this may introduce some degradation it will be negligible or at least acceptable in most scenarios.
- the broadcast processor 407 proceeds to receive and decode the broadcast control channel.
- the broadcast control data is passed to a bandwidth processor 409 which proceeds to determine the bandwidth used by the detected base station from the broadcast control data received.
- the base stations can include explicit data indicating the used bandwidth in the transmitted broadcast control channel.
- the bandwidth processor 409 is coupled to a data receiver 411 which is also coupled to the sequence store 405 .
- the data receiver 411 receives an indication of the specific bandwidth used by the base station from the bandwidth processor 411 . It can then proceed to communicate with the base station with full knowledge of the actual bandwidth used and thus can use the full transmitted GCL sequence. Accordingly, the data receiver 411 retrieves the full length GCL sequence from the sequence store 405 and uses this accurate sequence to derive a more accurate channel estimate.
- the system allows a much improved and simplified search and acquisition process. Furthermore, only a negligible or acceptable degradation is introduced for the initial phases with no long term degradation being introduced.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example of the amplitude of the real and imaginary value for two GCL sequences.
- the figure illustrates a GCL sequence with index 8 for a 1.25 MHz bandwidth compared to a GCL sequence with index 130 for a 20 MHz bandwidth.
- FIG. 6 illustrates a detection error performance for detecting GCL sequences of higher bandwidths using GCL sequences of lower bandwidths.
- MSE Mean Square Error
- CIR Carrier to Interference Ratio
- a set of GCL sequences are determined for a higher frequency based on the properties of a sub-sequence of the GCL sequences.
- the GCL sequences for the maximum bandwidth may be selected according to
- 12 GCL sequences are selected from the 210 possible GCL sequences but in this example the selection is not based on properties relative to other shorter GCL sequences associated with other bandwidths or GCL sequence lengths or sets, but are selected such that the 12 GCL sub-sequences themselves have attractive properties and specifically have strong auto correlation and cross correlation values.
- the subset of sequences is selected as those sequences having the following indices:
- u BW1 is a GCL sequence index for the bandwidth (i.e. 20 MHz in the example)
- N G,BW1 is a GCL sequence length for the bandwidth (i.e. 20 MHz in the example)
- M is a number of GCL sequences in the subset (i.e. 12 in the example).
- the 12 GCL sequences used for the maximum bandwidth are given by the above equations.
- the GCL sequences for the lower bandwidths are not determined from (or as) GCL sequences with a length given by the number of reference signal subcarriers allocated to the bandwidth. Rather, the GCL sequences for these bandwidths are directly obtained by truncating the GCL sequences for the maximum bandwidth to a length which is appropriate for the bandwidth.
- the GCL sequences for the lower bandwidths are truncated GCL sequences derived by truncation of the single set of GCL sequences determined for the maximum bandwidth.
- the truncation is arranged to maintain a central portion of the GCL sequences of the first subset.
- the sub-sequences to be used at lower frequencies includes the central element of the GCL sequences for the maximum bandwidth.
- FIG. 7 illustrates a specific example of an allocation of element numbers along the subcarrier domain for different bandwidths.
- the reference signal elements/symbols in the 12 subcarriers within the broadcast control channel correspond to elements 94 - 105 of the 211 element length GCL sequence for that cell identity regardless of what the employed bandwidth is.
- the subset of GCL sequences are selected such that the sub-sequences in the lower bandwidths (e.g. the sub-sequence of elements 94 - 105 ) have properties that allow them to be used as reference signal sequences.
- the selection of the subset of GCL sequences to be truncated is such that the truncated GCL sequences are sequences that are similar to corresponding non or minimally truncated GCL sequences.
- the detection processor 203 may monitor for the twelve truncated GCL sequences derived by truncating the 12 length sequences of length 211. As the elements of these twelve truncated GCL sequences are the same for all bandwidths, a correlation can be performed without knowing the exact applied bandwidth. The same approach of determining a channel estimate, receiving the broadcast channel and then applying the full length (possibly truncated) GCL sequence may be applied.
- the current approach applies the same sequence elements in all bandwidths but selects this sub-sequence to be similar to the GCL sequences for the minimum bandwidth.
- This approach may improve e.g. the detection and channel estimation as the local replica exactly corresponds to the transmitted data.
- some degradation may instead be incurred due to the truncated sequences having less optimal properties than full length or minimally truncated GCL sequences.
- FIG. 8 illustrates an example of method of operation for a cellular communication system employing a plurality of bandwidths in accordance with some embodiments of the invention.
- base stations transmit a reference signal comprising a GCL sequence where the length of the GCL sequence is dependent on a bandwidth employed by the base station.
- the method starts in step 801 wherein a first subset of GCL sequences is provided for a first frequency.
- the GCL sequences are selected from a set of possible GCL sequences for a first bandwidth in response to properties of a sub-sequence of sequences of the set of possible GCL sequences where the sub-sequence has a length corresponding to a different bandwidth.
- Step 801 is followed by step 803 wherein a first GCL sequence is selected for a first base station of the plurality of base stations employing the first bandwidth from the first subset of GCL sequences.
- Step 803 is followed by step 805 wherein the first base station transmits a reference signal comprising the first GCL sequence.

Abstract
Description
where NG is a length of a GCL sequence, k is an element number, u is an index identifying the sequence from the NG−1 possible GCL sequences of length NG. It will be appreciated that equivalents which do not change auto correlation, cross correlation and amplitude properties of the sequences may also be used. For example, multiplication of the elements by a constant (complex value) may be applied in some embodiments, resulting in sequences given by:
where α is a complex constant.
