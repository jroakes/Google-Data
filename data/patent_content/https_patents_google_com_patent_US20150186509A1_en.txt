Definitions
- This disclosure generally relates to media identification and, in one particular implementation, to reducing the power consumption of a device that may be identifying sequentially played songs.
- Many applications allow computing devices automatically identify songs. To do so, the user must activate a song identification service on a computing device, and must place the microphone of the computing device in a position where the computing device can record a short sound snippet of the song.
- the song identification service In response, the song identification service generates an audio fingerprint from the recorded sounds, and compares the audio fingerprint to a database of audio fingerprints that corresponds to a catalog of songs. If the song identification service identifies a match between the generated audio fingerprint and a particular audio fingerprint stored in the database, then the song identification application can display, on the display of the computing device, the name, the artist, and any other relevant information associated with the song whose particular audio fingerprint best matches the generated audio fingerprint.
- a computing device may receive an audio input and may identify a song associated with the audio input based on matching an audio fingerprint associated with the audio input to an audio fingerprint of the song. Once the computing device identifies the song, the computing device stores data that identifies the song, for later retrieval or use by the computing device or the user of the computing device.
- the computing device may determine which portion of the song to which the audio fingerprint corresponds and, if the duration of the song is known, a length of the song that remains to be played. Before attempting to recognize an additional song that may play after the song, and to conserve power, the computing device may power down an audio subsystem of the computing device for the remaining period of time left in the song. Once the remaining period of time has elapsed, the computing device may power up the audio subsystem, may identify the next song based on an audio fingerprint of the newly received audio input, and may store data that identifies the next song.
- the computing device may continue to attempt to identify songs, and may power up or down the audio subsystem, until instructed by a user to stop identifying songs, or until no further songs are detected. In instances when no following song plays, or when the computing device is unable to identify a following song, the computing device may power down the audio subsystem for another period of time and then, once the particular period of time has elapsed, may power up the audio subsystem to try to determine if a next song is playing. If the computing device is unable to identify a song for an extended period of time, then the computing device may stop attempting to identify songs.
- the computing device can display the list of songs that the device has identified, e.g. by accessing the stored data that identifies the recognized songs.
- the list can include the name of the song, the artist, and the time the song was played.
- the list may also include links that the user can select to purchase each song, or other information.

- FIG. 1 is a diagram of a device identifying a playlist in a power efficient manner.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example system for identifying a playlist in a power efficient manner.
- FIG. 3 is a diagram of an example process for power efficient identification of a playlist.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a diagram 100 of a device 105 that identifies a playlist of songs in a power-efficient manner.
- the device 105 receives audio through a microphone of the device 105 and identifies an item of media content that corresponds to the audio input.
- An item of media content may include a commercial, a movie trailer, or any other similar items of known length.
- the device 105 identifies the item of media content by generating an audio fingerprint of the item of media content and comparing that audio fingerprint to audio fingerprints that are associated with different items of media content.
- the device 105 indicates information associated with the identified item of media content to the user 110 , e.g., the song name.
- the device 105 determines which portion of the item of media content to which the received audio corresponds and a timestamp associated with the received audio.
- the device 105 accesses a database to determine the length, e.g. a playing time, of the item of media content. Using a play time corresponding with the portion of the item of media content to which the received audio corresponds and the length of the item of media content, the device 105 can determine the length of remaining time that the item of media content has to play. The device 105 can then deactivate certain components of an audio subsystem of the device 105 to conserve power.
- the device 105 can determine a time when the item of media content is expected to have finished playing. Once the time is reached, the device 105 can reactivate the audio subsystem to identify another item of media content by reiterating the audio fingerprinting, media identification, and timestamp identification processes. The device 105 may stop identifying items of media content when the device receives instructions from a user or when the device has been unable to identify an item of media content for a particular period of time. After the device 105 has completed identifying items of media content, the user 110 may view on the device 105 a list 115 of the items of media content identified by the device 105 .
- the device 105 which may include a mobile phone, a tablet device, a wearable computer, or any other computing device, receives an instruction from the user 110 to begin identifying items of media content. For example, as shown in screen 115 , the user 110 may select a control to instruct the device 105 to identify the songs currently playing outside of the device 105 .
- the device 105 records portions of the items of media content through a microphone of the device or through a device plugged into an input port of the device such as an audio jack.
- the user 110 is listening to Song #1, and instructs the device 105 to identify the song or songs that are being played.
- the device 105 after receiving an instruction from the user, records an audio snippet of Song #1 using the microphone, generates an audio fingerprint from the snippet, and identifies the song as Song #1 using audio fingerprinting techniques.
- the audio fingerprint may be generated based on tempo, average frequency spectrum, prominent tones, bandwidth, and/or other audio characteristics.
- the device 105 may compare the audio fingerprint to a database containing other audio fingerprints and corresponding identities and, based on that comparison, may identify the song as Song #1.
- the comparison of the determined fingerprint and the audio fingerprints involves determining a confidence score. If the confidence score for the comparison of the determined fingerprint and an audio fingerprint in the database satisfies a threshold, then the device determines that the determined fingerprint and the audio fingerprint in the database match. For example, the device may determine an audio fingerprint for Song #1. The device may compare the audio fingerprint for Song #1 to audio fingerprints in an audio fingerprint database that is accessible over the network. The device may determine that the comparison of the audio fingerprint for Song #1 and an audio fingerprint from the database corresponding to “Birthday Song” has a confidence score of eighty-five. If the threshold is eighty, then the device determines that the two audio fingerprints match. The device determines that Song #1 is “Birthday Song.”
- the device 105 also determines that the recorded portion of Song #1 corresponds to the portion of the song between 1:03 and 1:22 as well as timestamps associated with the portion of the song.
- the device 105 may access a database to determine the length of Song #1.
- the device 105 may determine the length of time remaining in Song #1 by subtracting the end time of the recorded portion of the song from the length of the song. For Song #1, the remaining time is one minute and fifty-three seconds
- the device 105 deactivates certain components of the audio subsystem of the device 105 for at least the remaining period of play for Song #1.
- the audio subsystem receives and process audio received through the microphone or an input port.
- the device 105 deactivates the audio subsystem of device 105 for the remaining period of play for the identified song plus an additional period of time. For example, the device 105 may deactivate the audio subsystem of the device 105 for an additional five seconds.
- the device 105 may display the name of the song and the amount of time that the device 105 may deactivate the audio subsystem as shown in screen 120 .
- the device 105 determines a time associated with the deactivation. The device compares the deactivation time to the time remaining for the item of media content. If the two time are different, then the device 105 adjusts the deactivation period for the audio subsystem. For example, if the device 105 received the last portion of the received audio at a time of 4:13:35 and the device 105 deactivated the audio subsystem at a time of 4:13:37, then the device would subtract two seconds from the deactivation time. Once the device 105 has deactivated the audio subsystem, the device sets a reminder to reactivate the audio subsystem at the time of the deactivation time plus the time remaining for the item of media content.
- the timestamp associated with the deactivation may be 4:13:37 and the device 105 determines to deactivate the audio subsystem one minute and fifty-eight seconds.
- the reactivation time for the audio subsystem is 4:15:35.
- deactivating the audio subsystem allows the device 105 to conserve battery power by powering down the audio subsystem or placing the audio subsystem in a low power state. In other implementations, deactivating the audio subsystem allows the device 105 to avoid recording and processing unnecessary audio and therefore allow save processing power of the device 105 . In some implementations, deactivating the audio subsystem improves privacy by preventing the microphone from continuously receiving and processing audio that are unrelated to the music identification process.
- the device 105 reactivates the audio subsystem at a time of 4:15:35 so that the device 105 may identify the next song playing.
- the device 105 receives an audio snippet corresponding to Song #2 though the microphone of the device 105 and after fourteen seconds of Song #2, the device 105 deactivates the audio subsystem of the device 105 .
- the device 105 determines the remaining amount of play in Song #2 by accessing a database. For Song #2, the device 105 determines that there are three minutes, forty-eight seconds remaining. The device 105 may add additional time to the remaining play time of Song #2 and deactivate the microphone of device 105 for three minutes and fifty-three seconds. The device may display the identification of Song #2 and an indication of the amount of time that the microphone will be deactivated in screen 125 .
- the device repeats the process used to recognize Song #1 and Song #2 and uses the process to identify Song #3.
- the device 105 may display the identity of Song #3 and the amount of time that the device 105 will deactivate the audio subsystem in screen 130 .
- the device 105 may stop identifying songs when instructed by the user or when the device 105 is no longer able to recognize songs from the received audio.
- the device 105 may stop identifying media items when the user 110 instructs, through a touch screen or other input device, the device 105 to stop identifying songs. For example, the user may have been listening to songs at a bar and instructed the device to remember the list of songs being played. Once the user leaves the bar, the user may instruct the device to stop identifying songs.
- the device 105 may stop identifying media items when the device does not detect audio that corresponds to items of media content through the microphone for a particular period of time. For example, the device 105 may deactivate the microphone for three minutes and sixteen seconds.
- the device 105 may not detect any songs for two minutes. After two minutes of not detecting any songs, the device 105 may stop identifying more songs. In some instances, the device 105 may identify the same item of media content that the device 105 previously identified. For example, the device may identify “Birthday Song” and then after “Birthday Song” is expected to be complete, the device identifies “Birthday Song” again. In this case, the device 105 may deactivate the audio subsystem for a particular amount of time, such as thirty seconds, and then reactivate the audio subsystem to identify an item of media content corresponding to the subsequently received audio.
- a particular amount of time such as thirty seconds
- the device 105 stores the list of identified media items in a storage medium within the device 105 .
- the device 105 may label the list of identified media items by the date identified and the user can select a previously identified list to view the list of identified media items. For example, the day following the identifying of Song #1, Song #2, and Song #3, the user 110 may instruct the device 105 to show the user 110 the list of songs played the night before.
- the device 105 may display the list of songs as shown in screen 115 .
- the list when the device 105 displays the list of identified media items, the list includes links to purchase the media items or items associated with the media items. For example, with songs or movie trailers, the list may include links to purchase the songs or movies. With commercials, the list may include links to purchase products advertised in the commercials. The list may also include advertisements associated with the items of media content. For example, if the list includes jazz songs, the list may include advertisements for other jazz songs or artists or links to purchase other jazz songs. Similarly, a list may include links to purchase songs that were not played but are from the same artist as those songs on the list or include links to purchase songs from the same album or the entire album. The list may include links to execute search queries associated with the songs. For example, if the list contains songs from the Joe Smith Band, the list may include a link to the Joe Smith Band website.
- the list may be used by an advertising server to decide what advertisements to serve to the user.
- the list may also include a knowledge panel that is associated with each item of media content.
- the list may include “Birthday Song” by the Joe Smith Band and the list may include additional information about “Birthday Song” including the album, release date, length, record label, genre, writer, producer or any other pertinent information.
- the list may also include the opportunity to rate each item of media content.
- the list may include the opportunity to rank a particular song on a scale of one to five and to include a review.
- the list may include a list of other users from the user's social network who may be associated with the same list of items of media content. For example, two users who are connected in a social network attend the same concert and instruct their respective devices to remember the songs played. When the users view the list of songs the following day the list may indicate that the user's friend may have been at the same concert.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example system 200 for identifying a playlist in a power efficient manner.
- the system 200 may be implemented on a computing device such as the device 105 .
- the device 105 includes an audio subsystem 205 with a microphone 206 to receive incoming audio.
- the audio subsystem 205 converts audio received through the microphone 206 to a digital signal using the analog-to-digital converter 207 .
- the audio subsystem also includes buffers 208 .
- the buffers 208 may store the digitized audio, e.g., in preparation for further processing by the system 200 .
- the audio subsystem may contain multiple microphones, and in turn, each microphone may be associated with and connect to different analog-to-digital converters and/or buffers.
- One of the microphone may be used to identify items of media content and another microphone may be used for a phone call, video chat, or another voice application.
- the audio subsystem 205 may include an input port such as an audio jack.
- the input port may be connected to, and receive audio from, an external device such as an external microphone, and be connected to, and provide audio to, the audio subsystem.
- the audio subsystem 205 or particular components of the audio subsystem 205 are capable of being powered off or placed in a low power state.
- the system 200 may disconnect the power supply to the microphone 206 , the analog-to-digital converter 207 , the buffers 208 , or any other components of the audio subsystem 205 .
- powering down the audio subsystem 205 or placing the audio subsystem 205 in a low power state prevents the audio subsystem 205 from being able to receive audio.
- the audio subsystem 205 may be unable to receive audio because the microphone 206 is powered down.
- powering down the audio subsystem 205 or placing the audio subsystem 205 in a low power state prevents the audio subsystem 205 from being able to process audio.
- the audio subsystem 205 may be unable process audio because the analog-to-digital converter 207 is in a low power state.
- the audio processor 210 receives the digitized audio from the audio subsystem 205 .
- the audio processor 210 gathers data from different components of the system 200 to determine a list of compositions that is being received by the system 200 .
- the audio processor 210 includes a series of compositions engine 212 to process the data received from the different components of the system 200 .
- the audio processor 210 When the audio processor 210 receives the initial portion of the digitized audio, the audio processor 210 receives a timestamp from the system clock 215 and marks the initial portion of the digitized audio as received at that particular time. The audio processor 210 sends the digitized audio to the music identification engine 220 . The music identification engine 220 generates audio fingerprints of the digitized audio using the audio fingerprint generator 221 and compares, using the audio fingerprint comparer 222 , the generated audio fingerprints to audio fingerprints from the audio fingerprint database 225 .
- the audio processor 210 may send a particular portion of the digitized audio to the music identification engine 210 .
- the audio processor 210 may receive twenty seconds of digitized audio and send the twenty seconds of digitized audio to the music identification engine 220 .
- the music identification engine 220 generates an audio fingerprint of the digitized audio and provides possible matches for the digitized audio along with corresponding confidence scores.
- the audio processor 210 determines an identity of the composition based on the confidence scores from the music identification engine 210 .

- the audio processor 210 may provide additional digitized audio to the music identification engine 220 .
- the music identification engine 220 may provide updated identities and corresponding confidence scores for the audio based on the additional digitized audio.
- the audio processor 210 may then select the highest confidence score that satisfies the threshold.
- the music identification engine 220 may also determine and provide to the audio processor 210 the time within the composition where the portion received by the music identification engine 220 occurs. For example, the music identification engine 220 may receive twenty seconds of “Birthday Song.” The music identification engine 220 determines that those twenty seconds occur between 1:25 and 1:45 of the song and provides that information to the audio processor 210 .
- the audio processor 210 accesses the music composition knowledge database 230 .
- the music composition database 230 contains data related to different compositions including artist, title, length, publisher, and other information.

- the audio processor 210 determines the length of the identified song, the audio processor 210 deactivates the audio subsystem 205 for the remaining time in the identified song or the remaining time in the identified song plus additional time.
- the audio processor 210 compares the time when the audio processor 210 received the digitized audio from the audio subsystem to a current time when the audio processor received the length of composition from the music composition database 230 .
- the audio processor 210 instructs the audio subsystem 205 to deactivate and after the remaining time of the composition has elapsed, the audio processor 210 instruct the audio subsystem 205 to reactivate.
- the audio processor 210 may begin receiving digitized audio of a song at the time of 1:42:11. At the time of 1:42:31, the audio processor 210 transmits the digitized audio to the music identification engine 220 .
- the music identification engine 220 generates an audio fingerprint based on the twenty seconds of audio and determines that, among other confidence scores, that the confidence score of the generated fingerprint to the audio fingerprint of “Birthday Song” is eighty-four.
- the music identification engine 220 also determines that the received twenty seconds correspond to a portion of the song between 2:02 to 2:22.
- the confidence score of “Birthday Song” is the highest received from the music identification engine 220 , and the audio processor 210 determines that “Birthday Song” matches the received audio.
- the audio processor 210 receives information from the music composition knowledge base 230 indicating that “Birthday Song” is four minutes and ten seconds long. Once the audio processor 210 has the length of “Birthday Song,” the audio processor determines that the current time is 1:42:36. With the 2:22 portion of the song occurring at a time of 1:42:31, the audio processor 210 determines that the song is currently at the 2:27 portion and that the song has one minute and forty three seconds remaining.
- the audio processor 210 instructs the audio subsystem 205 to deactivate and once the system clock reaches a time of 1:44:14, the audio processor 210 instructs the audio subsystem 205 to reactivate.
- the audio subsystem 205 may receive a reactivation instruction and the audio subsystem 205 begins to receive and process new audio.
- the reactivation instruction is generated automatically by the audio processor 210 based on the instruction from the user to identify all the songs being played and based on the audio processor 210 determining that the previous song is expected to be finished.
- the system 200 may determine that it is unable to identify the new audio or that the new audio matches the previous song.

Description
- This disclosure generally relates to media identification and, in one particular implementation, to reducing the power consumption of a device that may be identifying sequentially played songs.
- Many applications allow computing devices automatically identify songs. To do so, the user must activate a song identification service on a computing device, and must place the microphone of the computing device in a position where the computing device can record a short sound snippet of the song.
- In response, the song identification service generates an audio fingerprint from the recorded sounds, and compares the audio fingerprint to a database of audio fingerprints that corresponds to a catalog of songs. If the song identification service identifies a match between the generated audio fingerprint and a particular audio fingerprint stored in the database, then the song identification application can display, on the display of the computing device, the name, the artist, and any other relevant information associated with the song whose particular audio fingerprint best matches the generated audio fingerprint.
- According to an innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification, a computing device may receive an audio input and may identify a song associated with the audio input based on matching an audio fingerprint associated with the audio input to an audio fingerprint of the song. Once the computing device identifies the song, the computing device stores data that identifies the song, for later retrieval or use by the computing device or the user of the computing device.
- In addition to identifying the song using the audio fingerprint, the computing device may determine which portion of the song to which the audio fingerprint corresponds and, if the duration of the song is known, a length of the song that remains to be played. Before attempting to recognize an additional song that may play after the song, and to conserve power, the computing device may power down an audio subsystem of the computing device for the remaining period of time left in the song. Once the remaining period of time has elapsed, the computing device may power up the audio subsystem, may identify the next song based on an audio fingerprint of the newly received audio input, and may store data that identifies the next song.
- The computing device may continue to attempt to identify songs, and may power up or down the audio subsystem, until instructed by a user to stop identifying songs, or until no further songs are detected. In instances when no following song plays, or when the computing device is unable to identify a following song, the computing device may power down the audio subsystem for another period of time and then, once the particular period of time has elapsed, may power up the audio subsystem to try to determine if a next song is playing. If the computing device is unable to identify a song for an extended period of time, then the computing device may stop attempting to identify songs.
- When requested by the user, for example on the following day, the computing device can display the list of songs that the device has identified, e.g. by accessing the stored data that identifies the recognized songs. The list can include the name of the song, the artist, and the time the song was played. The list may also include links that the user can select to purchase each song, or other information.

FIG. 1 illustrates a diagram 100 of adevice 105 that identifies a playlist of songs in a power-efficient manner. In general, thedevice 105 receives audio through a microphone of thedevice 105 and identifies an item of media content that corresponds to the audio input. An item of media content may include a commercial, a movie trailer, or any other similar items of known length. Thedevice 105 identifies the item of media content by generating an audio fingerprint of the item of media content and comparing that audio fingerprint to audio fingerprints that are associated with different items of media content. Thedevice 105 indicates information associated with the identified item of media content to theuser 110, e.g., the song name. Thedevice 105 determines which portion of the item of media content to which the received audio corresponds and a timestamp associated with the received audio. - The
device 105 accesses a database to determine the length, e.g. a playing time, of the item of media content. Using a play time corresponding with the portion of the item of media content to which the received audio corresponds and the length of the item of media content, thedevice 105 can determine the length of remaining time that the item of media content has to play. Thedevice 105 can then deactivate certain components of an audio subsystem of thedevice 105 to conserve power. - Based on the deactivation time and the length of remaining time that the item of media content has to play, the
device 105 can determine a time when the item of media content is expected to have finished playing. Once the time is reached, thedevice 105 can reactivate the audio subsystem to identify another item of media content by reiterating the audio fingerprinting, media identification, and timestamp identification processes. Thedevice 105 may stop identifying items of media content when the device receives instructions from a user or when the device has been unable to identify an item of media content for a particular period of time. After thedevice 105 has completed identifying items of media content, theuser 110 may view on the device 105 alist 115 of the items of media content identified by thedevice 105. - In more detail, the
device 105, which may include a mobile phone, a tablet device, a wearable computer, or any other computing device, receives an instruction from theuser 110 to begin identifying items of media content. For example, as shown inscreen 115, theuser 110 may select a control to instruct thedevice 105 to identify the songs currently playing outside of thedevice 105. Thedevice 105 records portions of the items of media content through a microphone of the device or through a device plugged into an input port of the device such as an audio jack. - In
FIG. 1 , theuser 110 is listening toSong # 1, and instructs thedevice 105 to identify the song or songs that are being played. Thedevice 105, after receiving an instruction from the user, records an audio snippet ofSong # 1 using the microphone, generates an audio fingerprint from the snippet, and identifies the song asSong # 1 using audio fingerprinting techniques. The audio fingerprint may be generated based on tempo, average frequency spectrum, prominent tones, bandwidth, and/or other audio characteristics. - The
device 105 may compare the audio fingerprint to a database containing other audio fingerprints and corresponding identities and, based on that comparison, may identify the song asSong # 1. In some implementations, the comparison of the determined fingerprint and the audio fingerprints involves determining a confidence score. If the confidence score for the comparison of the determined fingerprint and an audio fingerprint in the database satisfies a threshold, then the device determines that the determined fingerprint and the audio fingerprint in the database match. For example, the device may determine an audio fingerprint forSong # 1. The device may compare the audio fingerprint forSong # 1 to audio fingerprints in an audio fingerprint database that is accessible over the network. The device may determine that the comparison of the audio fingerprint forSong # 1 and an audio fingerprint from the database corresponding to “Birthday Song” has a confidence score of eighty-five. If the threshold is eighty, then the device determines that the two audio fingerprints match. The device determines thatSong # 1 is “Birthday Song.” - The
device 105 also determines that the recorded portion ofSong # 1 corresponds to the portion of the song between 1:03 and 1:22 as well as timestamps associated with the portion of the song. Thedevice 105 may access a database to determine the length ofSong # 1. Thedevice 105 may determine the length of time remaining inSong # 1 by subtracting the end time of the recorded portion of the song from the length of the song. ForSong # 1, the remaining time is one minute and fifty-three seconds - The
device 105 deactivates certain components of the audio subsystem of thedevice 105 for at least the remaining period of play forSong # 1. The audio subsystem receives and process audio received through the microphone or an input port. In some implementations, thedevice 105 deactivates the audio subsystem ofdevice 105 for the remaining period of play for the identified song plus an additional period of time. For example, thedevice 105 may deactivate the audio subsystem of thedevice 105 for an additional five seconds. After identifying the song, thedevice 105 may display the name of the song and the amount of time that thedevice 105 may deactivate the audio subsystem as shown inscreen 120. - When the
device 105 deactivates the audio subsystem, thedevice 105 determines a time associated with the deactivation. The device compares the deactivation time to the time remaining for the item of media content. If the two time are different, then thedevice 105 adjusts the deactivation period for the audio subsystem. For example, if thedevice 105 received the last portion of the received audio at a time of 4:13:35 and thedevice 105 deactivated the audio subsystem at a time of 4:13:37, then the device would subtract two seconds from the deactivation time. Once thedevice 105 has deactivated the audio subsystem, the device sets a reminder to reactivate the audio subsystem at the time of the deactivation time plus the time remaining for the item of media content. ForSong # 1, the timestamp associated with the deactivation may be 4:13:37 and thedevice 105 determines to deactivate the audio subsystem one minute and fifty-eight seconds. When combined, the reactivation time for the audio subsystem is 4:15:35. - In some implementations, deactivating the audio subsystem allows the
device 105 to conserve battery power by powering down the audio subsystem or placing the audio subsystem in a low power state. In other implementations, deactivating the audio subsystem allows thedevice 105 to avoid recording and processing unnecessary audio and therefore allow save processing power of thedevice 105. In some implementations, deactivating the audio subsystem improves privacy by preventing the microphone from continuously receiving and processing audio that are unrelated to the music identification process. - The
device 105 reactivates the audio subsystem at a time of 4:15:35 so that thedevice 105 may identify the next song playing. Thedevice 105 receives an audio snippet corresponding toSong # 2 though the microphone of thedevice 105 and after fourteen seconds ofSong # 2, thedevice 105 deactivates the audio subsystem of thedevice 105. - As before with
Song # 1, thedevice 105 determines the remaining amount of play inSong # 2 by accessing a database. ForSong # 2, thedevice 105 determines that there are three minutes, forty-eight seconds remaining. Thedevice 105 may add additional time to the remaining play time ofSong # 2 and deactivate the microphone ofdevice 105 for three minutes and fifty-three seconds. The device may display the identification ofSong # 2 and an indication of the amount of time that the microphone will be deactivated inscreen 125. - The device repeats the process used to recognize
Song # 1 andSong # 2 and uses the process to identifySong # 3. Thedevice 105 may display the identity ofSong # 3 and the amount of time that thedevice 105 will deactivate the audio subsystem inscreen 130. - The
device 105 may stop identifying songs when instructed by the user or when thedevice 105 is no longer able to recognize songs from the received audio. In some implementations, thedevice 105 may stop identifying media items when theuser 110 instructs, through a touch screen or other input device, thedevice 105 to stop identifying songs. For example, the user may have been listening to songs at a bar and instructed the device to remember the list of songs being played. Once the user leaves the bar, the user may instruct the device to stop identifying songs. In some implementations, thedevice 105 may stop identifying media items when the device does not detect audio that corresponds to items of media content through the microphone for a particular period of time. For example, thedevice 105 may deactivate the microphone for three minutes and sixteen seconds. Upon reactivation of the microphone, thedevice 105 may not detect any songs for two minutes. After two minutes of not detecting any songs, thedevice 105 may stop identifying more songs. In some instances, thedevice 105 may identify the same item of media content that thedevice 105 previously identified. For example, the device may identify “Birthday Song” and then after “Birthday Song” is expected to be complete, the device identifies “Birthday Song” again. In this case, thedevice 105 may deactivate the audio subsystem for a particular amount of time, such as thirty seconds, and then reactivate the audio subsystem to identify an item of media content corresponding to the subsequently received audio. - In some implementations, the
device 105 stores the list of identified media items in a storage medium within thedevice 105. Thedevice 105 may label the list of identified media items by the date identified and the user can select a previously identified list to view the list of identified media items. For example, the day following the identifying ofSong # 1,Song # 2, andSong # 3, theuser 110 may instruct thedevice 105 to show theuser 110 the list of songs played the night before. Thedevice 105 may display the list of songs as shown inscreen 115. - In some implementations, when the
device 105 displays the list of identified media items, the list includes links to purchase the media items or items associated with the media items. For example, with songs or movie trailers, the list may include links to purchase the songs or movies. With commercials, the list may include links to purchase products advertised in the commercials. The list may also include advertisements associated with the items of media content. For example, if the list includes jazz songs, the list may include advertisements for other jazz songs or artists or links to purchase other jazz songs. Similarly, a list may include links to purchase songs that were not played but are from the same artist as those songs on the list or include links to purchase songs from the same album or the entire album. The list may include links to execute search queries associated with the songs. For example, if the list contains songs from the Joe Smith Band, the list may include a link to the Joe Smith Band website. - The list may be used by an advertising server to decide what advertisements to serve to the user. The list may also include a knowledge panel that is associated with each item of media content. For example, the list may include “Birthday Song” by the Joe Smith Band and the list may include additional information about “Birthday Song” including the album, release date, length, record label, genre, writer, producer or any other pertinent information. The list may also include the opportunity to rate each item of media content. For example, the list may include the opportunity to rank a particular song on a scale of one to five and to include a review. In some implementations, the list may include a list of other users from the user's social network who may be associated with the same list of items of media content. For example, two users who are connected in a social network attend the same concert and instruct their respective devices to remember the songs played. When the users view the list of songs the following day the list may indicate that the user's friend may have been at the same concert.

FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example system 200 for identifying a playlist in a power efficient manner. The system 200 may be implemented on a computing device such as thedevice 105. Thedevice 105 includes anaudio subsystem 205 with amicrophone 206 to receive incoming audio. Theaudio subsystem 205 converts audio received through themicrophone 206 to a digital signal using the analog-to-digital converter 207. The audio subsystem also includesbuffers 208. Thebuffers 208 may store the digitized audio, e.g., in preparation for further processing by the system 200. In some implementations, the audio subsystem may contain multiple microphones, and in turn, each microphone may be associated with and connect to different analog-to-digital converters and/or buffers. One of the microphone may be used to identify items of media content and another microphone may be used for a phone call, video chat, or another voice application. - In some implementations, the
audio subsystem 205 may include an input port such as an audio jack. The input port may be connected to, and receive audio from, an external device such as an external microphone, and be connected to, and provide audio to, the audio subsystem. - The
audio subsystem 205 or particular components of theaudio subsystem 205 are capable of being powered off or placed in a low power state. For example, the system 200 may disconnect the power supply to themicrophone 206, the analog-to-digital converter 207, thebuffers 208, or any other components of theaudio subsystem 205. In some implementations, powering down theaudio subsystem 205 or placing theaudio subsystem 205 in a low power state prevents theaudio subsystem 205 from being able to receive audio. For example, theaudio subsystem 205 may be unable to receive audio because themicrophone 206 is powered down. In some implementations, powering down theaudio subsystem 205 or placing theaudio subsystem 205 in a low power state prevents theaudio subsystem 205 from being able to process audio. For example, theaudio subsystem 205 may be unable process audio because the analog-to-digital converter 207 is in a low power state. - The
audio processor 210 receives the digitized audio from theaudio subsystem 205. Theaudio processor 210 gathers data from different components of the system 200 to determine a list of compositions that is being received by the system 200. Theaudio processor 210 includes a series ofcompositions engine 212 to process the data received from the different components of the system 200. - When the
audio processor 210 receives the initial portion of the digitized audio, theaudio processor 210 receives a timestamp from thesystem clock 215 and marks the initial portion of the digitized audio as received at that particular time. Theaudio processor 210 sends the digitized audio to themusic identification engine 220. Themusic identification engine 220 generates audio fingerprints of the digitized audio using theaudio fingerprint generator 221 and compares, using theaudio fingerprint comparer 222, the generated audio fingerprints to audio fingerprints from theaudio fingerprint database 225. - In some implementations, the
audio processor 210 may send a particular portion of the digitized audio to themusic identification engine 210. For example, theaudio processor 210 may receive twenty seconds of digitized audio and send the twenty seconds of digitized audio to themusic identification engine 220. Themusic identification engine 220 generates an audio fingerprint of the digitized audio and provides possible matches for the digitized audio along with corresponding confidence scores. Theaudio processor 210 determines an identity of the composition based on the confidence scores from themusic identification engine 210. In some implementations, theaudio processor 210 may select the identity of the composition that has the highest confidence score. In some implementations, theaudio processor 210 may require that the highest confidence score satisfy a threshold. In instances where the highest confidence score does not satisfy a threshold, theaudio processor 210 may provide additional digitized audio to themusic identification engine 220. Themusic identification engine 220 may provide updated identities and corresponding confidence scores for the audio based on the additional digitized audio. Theaudio processor 210 may then select the highest confidence score that satisfies the threshold. - The
music identification engine 220 may also determine and provide to theaudio processor 210 the time within the composition where the portion received by themusic identification engine 220 occurs. For example, themusic identification engine 220 may receive twenty seconds of “Birthday Song.” Themusic identification engine 220 determines that those twenty seconds occur between 1:25 and 1:45 of the song and provides that information to theaudio processor 210. - Once the
audio processor 210 identifies the composition that corresponds to the digitized audio, theaudio processor 210 accesses the musiccomposition knowledge database 230. Themusic composition database 230 contains data related to different compositions including artist, title, length, publisher, and other information. Themusic composition database 230 may be contained within thedevice 105 or may be accessible through a network. The audio processor receives the additional information related to the identified composition and stores the information in the list ofcompositions 235. - Once the
audio processor 210 determines the length of the identified song, theaudio processor 210 deactivates theaudio subsystem 205 for the remaining time in the identified song or the remaining time in the identified song plus additional time. Theaudio processor 210 compares the time when theaudio processor 210 received the digitized audio from the audio subsystem to a current time when the audio processor received the length of composition from themusic composition database 230. Theaudio processor 210 instructs theaudio subsystem 205 to deactivate and after the remaining time of the composition has elapsed, theaudio processor 210 instruct theaudio subsystem 205 to reactivate. - By way of example, the
audio processor 210 may begin receiving digitized audio of a song at the time of 1:42:11. At the time of 1:42:31, theaudio processor 210 transmits the digitized audio to themusic identification engine 220. Themusic identification engine 220 generates an audio fingerprint based on the twenty seconds of audio and determines that, among other confidence scores, that the confidence score of the generated fingerprint to the audio fingerprint of “Birthday Song” is eighty-four. Themusic identification engine 220 also determines that the received twenty seconds correspond to a portion of the song between 2:02 to 2:22. The confidence score of “Birthday Song” is the highest received from themusic identification engine 220, and theaudio processor 210 determines that “Birthday Song” matches the received audio. Theaudio processor 210 receives information from the musiccomposition knowledge base 230 indicating that “Birthday Song” is four minutes and ten seconds long. Once theaudio processor 210 has the length of “Birthday Song,” the audio processor determines that the current time is 1:42:36. With the 2:22 portion of the song occurring at a time of 1:42:31, theaudio processor 210 determines that the song is currently at the 2:27 portion and that the song has one minute and forty three seconds remaining. Theaudio processor 210 instructs theaudio subsystem 205 to deactivate and once the system clock reaches a time of 1:44:14, theaudio processor 210 instructs theaudio subsystem 205 to reactivate. - In some implementations, the
audio subsystem 205 may receive a reactivation instruction and theaudio subsystem 205 begins to receive and process new audio. The reactivation instruction is generated automatically by theaudio processor 210 based on the instruction from the user to identify all the songs being played and based on theaudio processor 210 determining that the previous song is expected to be finished. Once the audio subsystem is reactivated, the system 200 may determine that it is unable to identify the new audio or that the new audio matches the previous song. In these instances, theaudio processor 210 may instruct theaudio subsystem 205 to deactivate and then instruct theaudio subsystem 205 to reactivate after a particular period of time. For example, if theaudio processor 210 is unable to identify the next song, the audio processor may deactivate the audio subsystem and reactivate the audio subsystem after thirty seconds. - The
user input module 240 receives input from a user and instructs the audio processor according to the received input. Theuser input module 240 may receive an instruction from the user to begin identifying audio compositions being received through the microphone. Theuser input module 240 may also receive an instruction from the user to stop identifying audio compositions. As an alternative to receiving an instruction from the user to stop identifying audio compositions, theaudio processor 210 may stop identifying audio compositions if no audio that corresponds to audio compositions are received after a particular period of time. - The
user interface generator 245 generates a user interface for display on a screen of thedevice 105. Theuser interface generator 245 may display information pertaining to each identified song such as the title, artist, length, a location to purchase the song, and any associate album artwork. Theuser interface generator 245 may also display the status of theaudio subsystem 205, such as whether or not theaudio subsystem 205 is active. Theuser interface generator 245 may display the list of identified compositions. The following morning, the user may instruct thedevice 105 to display the list of songs played and the user interface generator would generate the display for thedevice 105. -
FIG. 3 is a diagram of anexample process 300 for power efficient identification of a playlist. Theprocess 300 may be performed by a computing device such as thedevice 105 fromFIG. 1 . Theprocess 300 analyzes audio data, identifies items of media content, and in between identifications, places thedevice 105 is low power state. - The
device 105 receives an audio recording of an item of media content (310). Thedevice 105 may receive the audio recording through a microphone of thedevice 105 or through an audio jack of thedevice 105. The item of media content may be song, a commercial, or a movie trailer. The audio recording may be a particular length such as twenty seconds. - The
device 105 determines an identifier associated with the item of media content, and a timestamp (320). Thedevice 105 determines an audio fingerprint of the item of media content and compares that audio fingerprint to an audio fingerprint database. The device determines the audio fingerprint in the database that matches the audio fingerprint of the item of media content. Based on the audio fingerprint matching, the device determines the identity of the item of media content. As thedevice 105 receives the item of media content, the device records a timestamp that corresponds to when the device received the first portion of the item of media content. When matching the audio fingerprint of the item of media content with the audio fingerprints in the database, thedevice 105 determines the portion of the item of media content where the received audio occurs, such as between 1:05 and 1:25 of the item of media content. - In some implementations, to determine the identity of the item of media content, the
device 105 will generated confidence scores based on the comparison of the audio fingerprint of the item of media content and each fingerprint in the audio fingerprint database. Thedevice 105 may select the audio fingerprint in the database and fingerprint of the item of media content combination that produces the highest confidence score. In instances where thedevice 105 requires the confidence score to satisfy a threshold, thedevice 105 may use additional audio recordings from the item of media content to generate more audio fingerprints to compare to the audio fingerprints in the database. - The
device 105 determines based on the identifier of the item of media content and the timestamp, an amount of remaining time that the item of media content has to play (330). Thedevice 105 accesses a media item knowledge base that contains data associated with one or more media items. In accessing the media item knowledge base, thedevice 105 determines the length of the item of media content. By subtracting out the amount of time that the item of media content has already played, the device can determine the remaining time for the item of media content. - The
device 105 provides, in response to determining the amount of remaining time that the item of media content has to play, providing an indication for one or more components of thedevice 105 to deactivate (340). In some implementations, thedevice 105 may instruct the microphone, analog-to-digital convert, buffers, or any combination of the three to deactivate. Thedevice 105 may stop supplying power to one or more components of the audio subsystem. Alternatively, thedevice 105 may instruct the one or more component of the audio subsystem to enter a sleep or low power mode. In some implementations, thedevice 105 may instruct the display, the network adapter, and/or another component of thedevice 105 to deactivate, sleep, or enter low power mode. - The
device 105 determines that the amount of time has elapsed (350). Thedevice 105 monitors the system time to determine when the remaining time for the item of media content has elapsed. For example, thedevice 105 may be waiting for one and a half minutes to elapse. The system time when thedevice 105 began waiting was 15:23:19, then thedevice 105 would wait until the system time reached 15:24:49. - The
device 105 provides, in response to determining that the amount of time has elapsed, an indication for the one or more components of thedevice 105 reactivate (360). In instances where thedevice 105 stopped supplying power to the one or more components of the audio subsystem, thedevice 105 would begin supplying power to the one or more components of the audio subsystem again. In instances where thedevice 105 instructed the one or more components of the audio subsystem to sleep or be in a low power state, thedevice 105 would instruct the one or more components of the audio subsystem to return to full power mode. In instances where thedevice 105 instructed the display, the network adapter, and/or another component of thedevice 105 to deactivate, sleep, or enter low power mode, thedevice 105 will instruct those particular components to reactivate. - The
device 105 may store the identity of the item of media content in a list. Each subsequently identified item of media content may be appended to the list. Thedevice 105 may receive an instruction from the user to display the list of items of media content. Thedevice 105 then retrieves the list and displays the list on a screen of thedevice 105. - Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
