The method further comprises attempting to establish an upstream connection between the ONU and the OLT (320). When the ONU establishes an upstream connection to the OLT, the method further comprises receiving a message (312) at the ONU to initiate calibration of the ONU, wherein the message is generated to indicate that the DBR laser is operating outside of the operational state.

Description
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates to field calibration of laser transmitters.
Background
Fiber optic communication is an emerging method of transferring information from a source (transmitter) to a destination (receiver) using optical fiber as a communication channel. Wavelength division multiplexing-passive optical networks (WDM-PONs) are optical technologies used for access and backhaul networks. WDM-PONs use a number of different wavelengths over a physical point-to-multipoint fiber infrastructure containing passive optical components. The use of different wavelengths allows traffic separation within the same physical fiber. The result is a network that provides logical point-to-point connections through a physical point-to-multipoint network topology. WDM-PON allows operators to deliver high bandwidth over long distances to multiple endpoints. A PON typically comprises an Optical Line Terminal (OLT) located at a service provider central office (e.g., hub), a remote node connected to the central office by a feeder fiber, and a number of Optical Network Units (ONUs) (e.g., Optical Network Terminals (ONTs)) in the vicinity of end users.
The ONUs typically include a laser to generate an optical signal that is transmitted to the OLT. The ONU laser may be a Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) laser. A distributed bragg reflector laser (DBR) is a stable, low noise, single frequency laser diode. DBR laser structures are fabricated with surface features that define a monolithic, single-mode ridge waveguide that extends the entire length of the device. The DBR laser includes a resonant cavity with a highly reflective DBR mirror at one end and a low reflectivity cleaved exit facet (clean exit facet) at the other end. The laser light is emitted from the exit surface opposite the DBR end. The DBR mirror reflects only a single longitudinal mode. Thus, the laser operates in a single spatial and longitudinal mode. The cavity includes a gain ridge portion. The DBR is continuously tunable by varying the injection current or temperature. The increase in current in the gain region causes a red shift in the laser output due to heating. However, the reflectance profile of the exit face does not change. As a result, the exit face will experience a loss of reflectivity at longer wavelengths and will eventually cause a discontinuous blue shift in wavelength to find a higher gain mode.

The method includes determining, by data processing hardware, that a connection between an Optical Line Terminal (OLT) and an Optical Network Unit (ONU) fails to meet a connection quality criterion. The ONU comprises a Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) laser. The method further includes executing, by the data processing hardware, a self-calibration routine to determine an operating wavelength range of the DBR laser that maintains the connection between the OLT and the ONU and meets connection quality criteria. The self-calibration routine iteratively includes the following: tuning an injection current of the DBR laser to adjust a communication wavelength of the ONU; determining whether the communication wavelength establishes or maintains a connection between the OLT and the ONU; when the communication wavelength establishes or maintains the connection between the OLT and the ONU, determining whether the connection meets the connection quality criterion; and updating the operating wavelength range of the DBR laser to include the communication wavelength when the connection meets the connection quality criteria.
Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a system for in-situ calibration of a laser transmitter. The system includes data processing hardware and memory hardware in communication with the data processing hardware.

The operations include determining that a connection between an Optical Line Terminal (OLT) and an Optical Network Unit (ONU) fails to meet a connection quality criterion. The ONU comprises a Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) laser. The operations further include performing a self-calibration routine to determine an operating wavelength range of the DBR laser that maintains the connection between the OLT and the ONU and meets connection quality criteria. The self-calibration routine iteratively includes the following: tuning an injection current of the DBR laser to adjust a communication wavelength of the ONU; determining whether the communication wavelength establishes or maintains a connection between the OLT and the ONU; when the communication wavelength establishes or maintains the connection between the OLT and the ONU, determining whether the connection meets the connection quality criterion; and updating the operating wavelength range of the DBR laser to include the communication wavelength when the connection meets the connection quality criteria.
Implementations of the disclosure may include one or more of the following optional features. In some implementations, the connection quality criteria include satisfaction of at least one of a packet loss threshold, a frame Loss (LOF) indicator, a start failure (SUF) indicator, or a connection loss indicator. In some examples, determining that the connection between the OLT and the ONU fails to satisfy the connection quality criteria comprises receiving a physical layer operation, administration, and maintenance (PLOAM) message from the OLT indicating that the connection quality criteria has failed to be satisfied. In some configurations, determining that the connection between the OLT and the ONU fails to meet the connection quality criteria comprises receiving a frame LOSs (LOF) indicator, a LOSs of signal (LOS) indicator, or a start failure (SUF) indicator from firmware of the ONU. In some examples, determining that the connection between the OLT and the ONU fails to meet the connection quality criteria comprises receiving a Deactivation (DACT) indicator from firmware of the ONU. In these examples, determining that the connection satisfies the connection quality criteria includes determining that data processing hardware of the ONU has cleared the DACT indicator. Optionally, determining that the connection between the OLT and the ONU fails to meet the connection quality criteria comprises receiving a frame LOSs (LOF) indicator or a LOSs of signal (LOS) indicator from firmware of the OLT.
In some configurations, the self-calibration routine further includes determining a maximum wavelength of the operating wavelength range and a minimum wavelength of the operating wavelength range, and setting the injection current of the DBR laser to an operating injection current within the operating wavelength range. In these configurations, the operational injection current comprises an average or median value of the operating wavelength range.
Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a method for in-situ calibration of a laser transmitter. The method includes receiving a downstream connection from an Optical Line Terminal (OLT) at data processing hardware of an Optical Network Unit (ONU), wherein the ONU comprises a Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) laser. The method further comprises attempting, by the data processing hardware, to establish an upstream connection between the ONU and the OLT. When the ONU establishes an upstream connection to the OLT, the method further comprises receiving a message at data processing hardware of the ONU to initiate calibration of the ONU, wherein the message is generated to indicate that the DBR laser is operating outside of the operational state. The method further includes tuning, by data processing hardware of the ONU, the DBR laser to an operational state by adjusting an injection current of the DBR laser.
Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a system for in-situ calibration of a laser transmitter. The system includes an Optical Network Unit (ONU) including a Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) laser, data processing hardware, and memory hardware in communication with the data processing hardware. The memory hardware stores instructions that, when executed on the data processing hardware, cause the data processing hardware to perform operations. The operations include receiving a downstream connection from an Optical Line Terminal (OLT) to an ONU. The operations further include attempting to establish an upstream connection between the ONU and the OLT. When the ONU establishes an upstream connection to the OLT, the operations further comprise receiving a message to initiate calibration of the ONU, wherein the message is generated to indicate that the DBR laser is operating outside of the operational state. The operations further include tuning the DBR laser to an operational state by adjusting an injection current of the DBR laser.
These aspects may include one or more of the following optional features. In some examples, tuning the DBR laser to an operational state includes the following: adjusting the injection current of the DBR laser to a first injection current; determining a first injection current of the DBR laser to establish an upstream connection between the ONU and the OLT; identifying the first injection current as a first boundary of an operating window of an operating state of the DBR laser; adjusting the injection current of the DBR laser to a second injection current; determining that a second injection current of the DBR laser cannot maintain or establish an upstream connection between the ONU and the OLT; identifying the second injection current as a second boundary of an operating window of an operating state of the DBR laser; and supplying an operational injection current to the DBR laser, which may be between the first injection current and the second injection current. The operational injection current may be an average or median of the first injection current and the second injection current. In these examples, adjusting the injection current of the DBR laser to the first injection current may include incrementally changing the injection current. Determining that the second injection current for the DBR laser failed to maintain or establish the upstream connection between the ONU and the OLT may comprise receiving a start-up failure (SUF) indicator or a Deactivation (DACT) indicator at the ONU. Receipt of the DACT indicator at the ONU may indicate a failure to meet the error code threshold. In these examples, when the ONU fails to establish an upstream connection to the OLT, the method may further comprise initiating calibration of the ONU. Further, when the ONU establishes an upstream connection to the OLT, the method may further comprise communicating data from the ONU with an error rate that satisfies an error code threshold, wherein the error code threshold indicates an acceptable error level for data transmission through the ONU.

Detailed Description
More and more Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use Passive Optical Networks (PONs) to provide high speed connections to private homes and small businesses. ISPs find PONs attractive due to high reliability and/or low cost. By using passive components to separate optical signals, PONs avoid the complexity of maintaining electrical equipment in an outdoor environment. In a typical PON, one or more Optical Line Terminals (OLTs) are installed at the Central Office (CO) of the ISP, and Optical Network Units (ONUs) are installed at each customer site remote from the CO of the ISP. An ONU typically comprises a laser that generates an optical signal that is transmitted to the OLT. The ONU laser may be a Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) laser.
An ONU using a DBR laser may fail and need to be replaced in the field. Repairing or replacing a failed ONU may require dispatching a service technician to a remote user site. A user may not have network connectivity until a service technician can access the user's site. One source of ONU failure is optical signal power reduction at the transmission wavelength of the DBR laser. An ONU that has failed in the field can resume operation by recalibrating the DBR laser.
The present disclosure describes, among other things, a method for in-situ calibration of a DBR laser. The method can be performed on commercially available ONUs without significantly increasing the cost or complexity of the ONUs. By enabling ONUs to perform in-situ DBR laser calibration, a failed ONU can resume operation without imposing costs or extensive communication losses due to field replacement.
One aspect of the present disclosure provides a method for performing in-situ calibration of a Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) laser of an Optical Network Unit (ONU) deployed in a Passive Optical Network (PON) and optically coupled to an Optical Line Terminal (OLT). In some examples, the OLT is located at a Central Office (CO) premises and is optically coupled to a plurality of field-installed ONUs. In some examples, the ONUs are deployed at sites remote from the CO. The in-situ calibration method determines that the connection between the OLT and the ONU fails to meet the connection quality criteria and performs a self-calibration routine. The connection quality criteria are typically configured by the network entity to indicate when the connection may be compromised or degraded, thereby negatively impacting the ability of the user to communicate data with the PON. The self-calibration routine determines the operating wavelength range of the DBR laser that maintains the connection between the OLT and the ONU and meets the connection quality criteria. The self-calibration tuning routine may include tuning an injection current of the DBR laser to adjust a communication wavelength of the ONU and determining whether the communication wavelength establishes or maintains a connection between the OLT and the ONU. The tuning routine may further include determining whether the connection meets connection quality criteria and updating an operating wavelength range of the DBR laser when the connection meets the connection quality criteria.
This aspect of the disclosure may include one or more of the following optional features. In some examples, the communication quality criteria include satisfaction of at least one of a packet loss threshold, a frame Loss (LOF) indicator, a start failure (SUF) indicator, or a connection loss indicator. In other examples, the communication quality criterion is a Bit Error Rate (BER) of less than one thousand (1000) times (1). Another aspect of the disclosure provides for determining whether a communication wavelength establishes or maintains a connection between an OLT and an ONU comprises receiving a physical layer operations, administration, and maintenance (PLOAM) message from the OLT indicating a failure to meet a connection quality criterion.
Referring to fig. 1, an optical communication system 100 delivers communication signals 102 (e.g., optical signals) between an Optical Line Terminal (OLT)120 housed in a Central Office (CO)130 and Optical Network Units (ONUs) 140, 140a-n (e.g., optical transceivers) associated with users 150, 150a-n (also referred to as customers or subscribers) over communication links 110, 112a-n (e.g., fiber optic or line-of-sight free space optical communications). The ONUs 140, 140a-n are typically located at the premises 152, 152a-n of the users 150, 150 a-n.
Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) is any terminal and associated equipment located at the premises 152 of the user 150 and connected to the operator telecommunications channel C at a demarcation point ("demarcation"). A demarcation is a point established in a house, building, or group of buildings to separate customer equipment from Service Provider Equipment (SPE). Some examples of CPEs include telephones, routers, switches, Residential Gateways (RGs), set-top boxes, fixed mobile convergence products, home networking adapters, or internet access gateways that enable user 150 to access the services of a communication service provider and distribute them around premises 152 of user 150 via a Local Area Network (LAN). In the example shown, ONU 140 is a CPE.
In some implementations, the optical communication system 100 implements an optical access network 105 (such as a Passive Optical Network (PON)105), for example, for accessing and moving a fronthaul/backhaul network. Some examples of optical access network 105 include a 10 gigabit capable PON (XG-PON), a 10 gigabit capable symmetric PON (XGS-PON), a next generation PON (NG-PON), and other PONs that comply with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standards. In some examples, the optical communication system 100 implements a point-to-point (pt-2-pt) PON with a direct connection, such as an optical ethernet, where the home optical links 110, 112 (e.g., optical fibers) extend all the way back to the OLT 120 at the CO 130 and each customer 150, 150a-n is terminated by a separate OLT 120 a-n. In other examples, the optical communication system 100 implements a point-to-multipoint (pt-2-multi-pt) PON, wherein the shared OLT 120 services a plurality of customers 150, 150 a-n.
For example, the CO 130 includes at least one OLT 120 that connects the optical access network 105 to an Internet Protocol (IP), Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), or Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) backbone. Thus, each OLT 120 is an endpoint of the PON 105 and converts between electrical signals used by service provider equipment and optical signals 102 used by the PON 105. Depending on the implementation of the optical access network 105, each OLT 120, 120a-n comprises at least one transceiver 122, 122 a-n. OLT 120 transmits optical signal 102 over feeder fiber 110 via a corresponding transceiver 122 to a Remote Node (RN)170 that includes a band multiplexer 160 configured to demultiplex optical signal 102 and distribute demultiplexed optical signal 104 along a corresponding distribution fiber 112, 112a-n to a plurality of subscribers 150, 150 a-n. The band multiplexer 160 for multiplexing/demultiplexing may be an Array Wavelength Grating (AWG)180, which is a passive optical device. In some examples, each CO 130 includes multiple OLTs 120, 120a-n, and each OLT 120 is configured to serve a group of users 150. Further, each OLT 120 may be configured to provide signals in different services. For example, one OLT 120 provides services in an XG-PON and another OLT 120 provides services in an NG-PON.
As shown in fig. 1, CO 130 multiplexes signals received from several sources, such as a video media distribution source 132, an internet data source 134, and a voice data source 136, and multiplexes the received signals into one multiplexed signal 102 before transmitting the multiplexed optical signal 102 to RN 170 over feeder fiber 110. The multiplexing may be performed by OLT 120 or a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) located at CO 130. Typically, services are time division multiplexed on the packet layer.
Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) is a method of transmitting and receiving independent signals over a common signal path by using different, non-overlapping time slots. Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) uses multiple wavelengths λ to implement point-to-multipoint communications in the PON 105. The OLT 120 provides a plurality of wavelengths through one optical fiber 110 to a band multiplexer 160 at the RN 170, which band multiplexer 160 multiplexes/demultiplexes signals between the OLT 120 and the plurality of ONUs 140, 140 a-n. Multiplexing combines the plurality of input signals and outputs a combined signal. Time division wavelength division multiplexing (TWDM) uses a time dimension and a wavelength dimension to multiplex signals.
For WDM and Dense WDM (DWDM), the OLT 120 includes a plurality of optical transceivers 122, 122 a-n. Each optical transceiver 122 at a fixed wavelength λD(referred to as downstream wavelength) and transmitting the signal at a fixed wavelength λUThe optical signal 102 is received (referred to as the upstream wavelength). Downstream wavelength λDAnd upstream wavelength lambdaUMay be the same or different. In addition, channel C may define a pair of downstream wavelengths λDAnd upstream wavelength lambdaUAnd may assign a unique channel C to each optical transceiver 122, 122a-n of the corresponding OLT 120a-n。
Channel C, C for OLT 120 to its optical transceivers 122, 122a-na-nMultiplexing/demultiplexing is performed for passing the optical signal 102 through the feeder fiber 110. However, the band multiplexer 160 at the RN 170 multiplexes/demultiplexes the optical signals 102, 104a-n between the OLT 120 and the plurality of ONUs 140, 140 a-n. For example, for downstream communications, the band multiplexer 160 demultiplexes the optical signal 102 from the OLT 120 into the ONU optical signals 104, 104a-n (i.e., for each corresponding ONU 140, 140a-n, the downstream optical signal 104 d). For upstream communications, the band multiplexer 160 combines the ONU optical signals 104, 104a from each corresponding ONU 140, 140a-nn-multiplexed (i.e., upstream optical signal 104u, multiplexed into optical signal 102 for delivery to OLT 120). In order for the transmission to become successful, the optical transceivers 122, 122a-n of the OLT 120 are individually matched to the ONUs 140, 140 a-n. In other words, the downstream wavelengths λ of the respective downstream optical signal 104d and upstream optical signal 104u to and from a given ONU 140DAnd upstream wavelength lambdaU(i.e., channel C) and corresponding downstream wavelength λ of the optical transceiver 122DAnd upstream wavelength lambdaU(i.e., channel C) match.
Referring to fig. 2A, each OLT 120 may include data processing hardware 124 and memory hardware 126 in communication with the data processing hardware 124. Examples of data processing hardware 124 include control hardware, circuitry, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and the like. The memory hardware 126 may store instructions (e.g., via firmware) that, when executed on the data processing hardware 124, cause the data processing hardware 124 to perform operations to determine that the connection 320 between the Optical Line Terminal (OLT)120 and the Optical Network Unit (ONU)140 fails to satisfy one or more connection quality criteria 330. In some implementations, the quality criterion is that the Bit Error Rate (BER) of the upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140 is less than one-thousand (1000) times (1). Other error rate criteria may also be used. In some examples, the data processing hardware 124 of the OLT 120 determines that there is a loss of signal from the ONU 140. In some examples, the data processing hardware 124 of the OLT 120 detects a frame Loss (LOF) in the upstream optical signal 140u from the ONU 140 (e.g., when the OLT 120 receives at least four invalid delimiters from the ONU 140). In some examples, the data processing hardware 124 of the OLT 120 transmits a message 312 to the ONU 140 indicating that the connection 320 failed to satisfy the one or more connection quality criteria 330. Message 312 may be a physical layer operations, administration, and maintenance (PLOAM) message. PLOAM message format in international telecommunication union-telecommunication standardization sector (ITU-T) standard g.984.3 gigabit passive optical network (G-PON): defined in the transport convergence layer specification. In some implementations, the message 312 is a PLOAM Deactivation (DACT) message. In some implementations, custom PLOAM messages are transmitted. The message may also be any message indicating that the connection 320 failed to satisfy the one or more connection quality criteria 330.
The ONUs 140, 140a-n are typically located at the premises 152, 152a-n of the users 150, 150 a-n. In some implementations, each ONU 140, 140a-n includes a corresponding optical transceiver 142, 142a-n (e.g., including a laser or light emitting diode). In some examples, the optical transceiver 142 includes a Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) laser 200. Each ONU 140 may include data processing hardware 144 and memory hardware 146 in communication with the data processing hardware 144. Examples of data processing hardware 144 include control hardware, circuitry, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and the like. In some examples, the data processing hardware 144 includes a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 210. DAC 210 may include DAC configuration 370 (fig. 3A). In other examples, the data processing hardware 144 may communicate with a digital-to-analog converter (DAC)210 (e.g., via a communication bus). The DAC 210 may be configured by the data processing hardware 144 to supply the injection current 212 to the DBR laser 200. The wavelength of the DBR laser 200 can be tuned by adjusting the injection current 212 (fig. 2B). The memory hardware 146 may store instructions (e.g., via firmware) that, when executed on the data processing hardware 144, cause the data processing hardware 144 to perform operations to adjust the injection current 212 applied to the DBR laser 200. The ONU 140 may comprise a photodetector that converts the downstream optical signal 104d from the OLT 120 into electrical form. The electrical signals may be further demultiplexed to sub-components (e.g., data on a network, converting sound waves into electrical current using a microphone and back to their original physical form using a speaker, converting images into electrical current using a camera and back to physical form using a television or other video display).
Fig. 2B depicts an example DBR laser 200. Some configurations include multi-segment structures, where each segment/structure shares a single substrate. By way of example, the segments may include a gain segment, a phase segment, an electro-absorption (EA) segment, a Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) segment, and a thermoelectric cooling segment/module (TEC). In this example, each segment has a P-doped indium phosphide (InP) region on a shared N-doped InP substrate, which forms a respective diode (D) with a common cathode0、D1、D2、D3). These diodes can be driven by the corresponding injection current (I)GAIN、IPHASE、IDBR) Or voltage (V)EA) And (5) driving. The DBR laser includes a resonant cavity 214 having a highly reflective DBR mirror at one end and a low reflectivity cleaved exit facet at the other end. The cavity 214 includes a gain ridge portion. By varying the injection current 212 or temperature, the DBR section is continuously tunable. In some configurations, the DAC 210 provides an injection current 212 to a DBR section 214 of the laser 200. Adjusting the injection current 212 can change the refractive index of the DBR section 214 of the laser 200, shifting the resonant wavelength of the DBR cavity 214.
As the resonant wavelength of the DBR cavity 214 shifts, the laser power in the main spectral peak may become small, thereby affecting the power of the upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140. In addition, the power in the other (side) resonant modes of the DBR section 214 may be increased. The difference between the main spectral peak and the maximum side-mode power defines the side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR). Thus, as the resonant wavelength of the DBR section 214 shifts, the SMSR of the upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140 may decrease. When the SMSR is outside of the acceptable range, the upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140 may not meet the connection quality criteria 330.
Tuning the injection current 212 to the DBR section 214 of the laser 200 may also advantageously shift the resonant wavelength, resulting in an increased SMSR of the upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140. In an example, the DBR section 214 may experience an increase in the resonant frequency over time, allowing the side modes to become more dominant. The SMSR of the upstream optical signal 104u from ONU 140 decreases accordingly over time. The upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140 may not meet the connection quality criteria 330. Increasing the injection current 212 provided to the DBR section 214 of the laser 200 results in a red shift of the resonant wavelength of the DBR cavity 214 due to heating. In an example, the red-shift partially or fully compensates for the increase in resonant frequency over time. Accordingly, the SMSR of the upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140 can be increased. When the SMSR is within the acceptable range, the upstream optical signal 104u may satisfy the connection quality criteria 330.
Fig. 3A and 3B illustrate communication between the OLT 120 and the ONUs 140 to detect and/or initiate calibration of the DBR laser 200. These processes allow calibrator 300 to evaluate whether the connection between OLT 120 and ONU 140 can adequately communicate data for user 150. In some examples, calibrator 300 detects a loss of upstream optical signal 104u from ONU 140. In some examples, calibrator 300 determines that upstream optical signal 104u from ONU 140 fails to satisfy connection quality criteria 330. When the SMSR is outside of the acceptable range, the calibrator 300 may determine that the upstream optical signal 104u fails to satisfy the connection quality criteria 330. In other words, the calibrator 300 allows the PON system 105 to sense when the resonant wavelength of the DBR section 214 drifts outside of the operating wavelength range 350. The calibrator 300 performs operations (e.g., methods 400, 500) for in-situ calibration of the DBR laser 200. In some implementations, the data processing hardware 144 of the ONU 140 executes the calibrator 300. In other implementations, the calibrator 300 is executed in whole or in part by any suitable computing device 600 (fig. 6), such as the data processing hardware 124 at the OLT 120 or other computing device 600 located at the central office of the ISP.
Fig. 3A illustrates an example calibrator 300 executing on the data processing hardware 144 of the ONU 140. In some examples, the data processing hardware 124 of the OLT 120 determines that the upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140 fails to satisfy the connection quality criteria 330. Here, when the upstream optical signal 104u includes a loss of frame (LOF), the OLT 120 may determine that the upstream optical signal 104u fails to satisfy the connection quality criteria 330. For example, when OLT 120 receives at least four invalid delimiters in upstream optical signal 104u from ONU 140, OLT 120 may identify an LOF in upstream optical signal 104 u. In an additional example, when the OLT 120 detects that the Bit Error Rate (BER) of the upstream optical signal 104u is greater than 10-yIn time, the upstream optical signal 104u fails to meet the connection quality criteria 330, where y is a configurable number between 3 and 8, such as in a gigabit-capable passive optical network (G-PON) in ITU-T standard g.984.3: defined in the transport convergence layer specification. When the upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140 fails to meet the connection quality criteria 330, the data processing hardware 124 of the OLT 120 may transmit a PLOAM deactivation message 312 to the ONU 140. In some examples, OLT 120 transmits PLOAM message 312 to ONU 140 using downstream connection 310 between OLT 120 and ONU 140. In these examples, the downstream connection 310 may be established by transmitting the downstream optical signal 104d from the OLT 120 to the ONU 140. Data processing hardware 144 of ONU 140 can receivePLOAM message 312 and upon receipt of PLOAM deactivation message 312 issues a DACT indicator, such as a gigabit-capable passive optical network (G-PON) of ITU-T standard g.984.3: defined in the transport convergence layer specification.
In an additional example, data processing hardware 144 of ONU 140 issues a start failure (SUF) indicator. When ONU 140 fails to establish upstream connection 320 with OLT 120 after one or more attempts, data processing hardware 144 of ONU 140 may issue a SUF indicator. In response to the DACT or SUF indicator issued by the ONU 140, the calibrator 300 may determine that the upstream connection 320 with the OLT 120 has failed.
When the calibrator 300 determines that the upstream connection 320 with the OLT 120 has failed, the calibrator 300 performs self-calibration of the DBR laser 200 to determine the operating wavelength range 350 of the DBR section 214 that establishes and maintains the upstream connection 320 with the OLT 120. Further, self-calibration may determine an operating wavelength range 350 having communication wavelengths that satisfy one or more connection quality criteria 330. In some examples, the communication wavelengths that meet the one or more connection quality criteria 330 define the operational state of the DBR laser 200. The connection quality criteria 330 may include or require communications from the ONU 140 that meet a Bit Error Rate (BER) of an error code threshold. The error code threshold may indicate an acceptable error level for data transmission through ONU 140 that meets connection quality criteria 330. The error code threshold may be 10-ySuch as one of every kilobit transferred (e.g., one of 1000), where y is a configurable number between three and eight.
Self-calibration may determine an adjustable injection current range 340 of the DAC 210 for applying the injection current 212 of the DBR section 214 of the laser 200. The calibrator 300 may obtain an operational injection current range 360 for the injection current 212 by iteratively adjusting the injection current 212 within the adjustable injection current range 340. As the calibrator 300 iteratively adjusts the injection current 212 of the DBR section 214 of the laser 200, the ONU 140 transmits the upstream optical signal 104u to the OLT 120. When the ONU 140 transmits the upstream optical signal 104u to the OLT 120, the calibrator 300 determines whether a connection 320 with the OLT 120 is established. In some examples, the data processing hardware 124 of the OLT 120 also monitors whether the upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140 is satisfactoryConnection quality criteria 330. When a connection 320 with the OLT is established and the upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140 meets the connection quality criteria 330, the data processing hardware 124 of the OLT 120 may transmit a PLOAM message 312 to the data processing hardware 144 of the ONU 140. In some examples, when data processing hardware 144 receives PLOAM message 312, data processing hardware 144 of ONU 140 clears or deactivates the previously issued DACT indicator. In some implementations, when the data processing hardware 144 of the ONU 140 clears the SUF and DACT indicators, the calibrator 300 determines that the upstream connection 320 with the OLT 120 is established. When the calibrator 300 determines that an upstream connection 320 with the OLT 120 has been established, the calibrator 300 may record the associated injection current 212. In further implementations, the calibrator 300 records the wavelength of the DBR laser 200 associated with the established upstream connection 320 of the OLT 120. In some examples, the calibrator 300 records the DAC configuration 370 associated with the established upstream connection 320 as the operational injection current 212OPER。
In some configurations, the calibrator 300 determines the minimum injection current 212 in the operational injection current range 360MINAnd maximum injection current 212MAX. Calibrator 300 may configure DAC 210 to inject an operation into current 212OPERApplied to the DBR section 214 of the laser 200, which operates to inject the current 212OPERIs within the operational injection current range 360. In some examples, the calibrator 300 determines the average injection current 212 in the operating injection current range 360MEANOr a medium injection current 212MED. The calibrator 300 may configure the DAC 210 to inject an average injection current 212MEANOr a medium injection current 212MEDTo the DBR section 214 of the laser 200. The calibrator 300 may record the injection current 212 applied to the DBR section 214 of the laser 200 in a non-transitory memory of the data processing hardware 144. In additional examples, the calibrator 300 will correspond to the operational injection current 212OPERIs recorded in the memory hardware 146 of the ONU 140 (fig. 2A).
Referring to fig. 3B, the data processing hardware 124 of the OLT 120 may monitor one or more signal quality criteria of the upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140. The data processing hardware 124 may determine andthe connection 320 of ONU 140 is poor. In some examples, determining that the connection 320 with the ONU 140 is poor includes detecting a loss of the upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140. In some examples, the data processing hardware 124 determines that the upstream optical signal 104u fails to satisfy the one or more connection quality criteria 330. When the SMSR is outside of the acceptable range, the upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140 may fail to meet the connection quality criteria 330. When the connection 320 with the ONU 140 is poor, the data processing hardware 124 of the OLT 120 may transmit a PLOAM message 312 to the data processing hardware 144 of the ONU 140. In some examples, the calibrator 300 ignores the PLOAM message 312 when self-calibration has been performed recently (e.g., within the first 20 minutes). In some examples, the calibrator 300 performs self-calibration of the DBR laser 200 to determine an operating wavelength range 350 of the DBR section 214 that maintains the connection 320 with the OLT 120. Further, self-calibration may determine an operating wavelength range 350 having communication wavelengths that satisfy one or more connection quality criteria 330. The connection quality criteria 330 may include or define a Bit Error Rate (BER) of the upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140 that meets the connection quality criteria 330. The calibrator 300 may determine a minimum wavelength λ within the operating wavelength range 350MINAnd maximum wavelength lambdaMAX。
Similar to fig. 3A, self-calibration may include determining an adjustable injection current range 340 of the injection current 212 that the DAC 210 applies to the DBR section 214 of the laser 200. The calibrator 300 may obtain an operational injection current range 360 for the injection current 212 by iteratively adjusting the injection current 212 within the adjustable injection current range 340. When the calibrator 300 determines to establish the upstream connection 320 with the OLT 120, the calibrator 300 may record the associated injection current 212. In further implementations, the calibrator 300 records the wavelength of the DBR laser 200 associated with the established upstream connection 320 of the OLT 120. In further implementations, the calibrator 300 records the DAC configuration 370 of the DAC 210 associated with the upstream connection 320 established with the OLT 120.
In some examples, the calibrator 300 determines the minimum injection current 212 in the operating injection current range 360MINAnd maximum injection current 212MAX. Minimum injection current 212MINDefining DBR lasers200, the first boundary of the operating window. Maximum injection current 212MAXA second boundary of the operating window of the DBR laser 200 is defined. The calibrator 300 may determine the average injection current 212 in the operating injection current range 360MEANOr a medium injection current 212MED. In some examples, the calibrator 300 configures the DAC 210 to inject an average injection current 212MEANOr a medium injection current 212MEDTo the DBR section 214 of the laser 200. The calibrator 300 may record the injection current 212 applied to the DBR laser 200 in the memory hardware 126, 146.
Fig. 4 provides an example operational arrangement of a method 400 for performing in-situ calibration of the DBR laser 200. Here, the ONUs 140 are deployed in the PON 105 and optically coupled to the OLT 120. At operation 402, the method 400 determines that the connection 320 between the ONU 140 and the OLT 120 fails to satisfy the connection quality criteria 330. Satisfying the connection quality criteria 330 may include satisfying at least one of a Bit Error Rate (BER) threshold, a frame Loss (LOF) indicator, a start failure (SUF) indicator, or a connection loss indicator. At operation 404, the method 400 executes a self-calibration routine to determine an operating wavelength range 350 of the DBR laser 200 that maintains the connection 320 between the OLT 120 and the ONU 140 and meets the connection quality criteria 330. Performing the self-calibration routine includes iteratively performing operation 406 and 412.
At operation 406, the method 400 tunes the injection current 212 of the DBR section 214 of the laser 200 to adjust the communication wavelength of the ONU 140. Here, the method 400 configures the DAC 210 to supply the injection current 212 to the DBR section 214 of the laser 200, whereby the DAC 210 comprises a DAC configuration 370. At operation 408, the method 400 determines whether the communication wavelength establishes or maintains a connection 320 between the OLT 120 and the ONU 140. When the communication wavelength fails to establish or maintain the connection 320 (e.g., "no" at operation 408), the method 400 returns to operation 406. On the other hand, when the communication wavelength establishes or maintains the connection 320 (e.g., operation 408 is "yes"), the method 400 proceeds to operation 410 to determine whether the connection 320 satisfies the connection quality criteria 330. When the connection 320 fails to satisfy the connection quality criteria 330 (e.g., "no" at operation 410), the method 400 returns to operation 406. On the other hand, when the connection 320 meets the connection quality criteria 330 (e.g., operation 410 is yes), the method 400 proceeds to operation 412 and updates the operating wavelength range 350 of the DBR section 214 of the laser 200 to include the communication wavelength. In some examples, the method 400 records the DAC configuration 370 associated with the operating wavelength range 350.
Fig. 5 provides an example operational arrangement of a method 500 for performing in-situ calibration of a DBR laser 200 of an ONU 140, wherein the ONU 140 is deployed in the PON 105 and optically coupled to the OLT 120. At operation 502, the method 500 receives the downstream connection 310 from the OLT 120 at the ONU 140. The downstream connection 310 may be established by transmitting the downstream optical signal 104d from the OLT 120 and receiving the downstream signal 104d at the ONU 140. At operation 504, the method 500 attempts to establish an upstream connection 320 with the OLT 120. The upstream connection 320 may be established by transmitting an upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140 and receiving the upstream signal 104u at the OLT 120. The upstream connection 320 may fail to meet the connection quality criteria 330. Failure to meet the connection quality criteria 330 may indicate that the DBR laser 200 is operating outside of the operational state defined by the connection quality criteria 330. The DBR laser 200 can operate outside of the operational state when the SMSR of the upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140 is outside of the acceptable range. At operation 506, the method 500 receives a message 312 from the OLT 120 to initiate calibration of the ONU 140. Here, the message 312 may be generated by the OLT 120 to indicate that the DBR laser 200 is operating outside of the operational state. Some examples of messages 312 include PLOAM messages, messages that comply with technical report 069(TR-069) or other CPE remote management specifications, and commands issued from the central office of the ISP via TELNET or other remote execution protocol.
At operation 508, the method 500 configures the DAC 210 to incrementally adjust the injection current 212 supplied to the DBR section 214 of the laser 200. Here, DAC 210 includes a DAC configuration 370. In some implementations, the method 500 monotonically increases the injection current 212 from a low current to a high current. The method may also monotonically decrease the current from a high current to a low current. Other incremental adjustment techniques may also be used. At operation 510, the method 500 determines whether the upstream connection 320 satisfies the connection quality criteria 330. Meeting the connection quality criteria 330 may indicate that the DBR laser 200 is operating within an operational state. When the SMSR of the upstream optical signal 104u from the ONU 140 is within an acceptable range, DBR laser 200 may be operated within an operating state. When the upstream connection 320 fails to satisfy the connection quality criteria 330 (e.g., "no" at operation 510), the method 500 returns to operation 508. On the other hand, when the upstream connection 320 meets the connection quality criteria 330, the method 500 proceeds to operation 512 and determines whether the injection current 212 establishes a first boundary of the operating window of the DBR laser 200. When the injection current 212 fails to establish the first boundary (e.g., "no" at operation 512), the method 500 returns to operation 508. On the other hand, when the injection current 212 establishes the first boundary of the operating window of the DBR laser 200 (e.g., operation 512 is yes), the method 500 proceeds to operation 514 and identifies the first injection current 212 as the first boundary of the operating window of the DBR laser 200. In some examples, the first injection current is a minimum injection current 212 associated with an operating window of the DBR laser 200MIN。
At operation 516, the method 500 determines whether the injection current 212 establishes a second boundary of the operating window of the DBR laser 200. When the first injection current 212 fails to meet the connection quality criteria at operation 512, the method 500 may perform operation 516 after adjusting the injection current at operation 508. When the injection current 212 fails to establish the second boundary (e.g., "no" at operation 516), the method 500 returns to operation 508. On the other hand, when the injection current 212 establishes the second boundary of the operating window of the DBR laser 200 (e.g., operation 516 is yes), the method 500 proceeds to operation 518 and identifies the second injection current 212 as the second boundary of the operating window of the DBR laser 200. In some examples, the second injection current is a maximum injection current 212 associated with an operating window of the DBR laser 200MAX。
At operation 510, the method 500 supplies an operational injection current to the DBR laser 200 at the first injection current 212MINAnd a second injection current 212MAXIn the meantime. In some examples, the operational injection current is the first injection current 212MINAnd a second injection current 212MAXMedian or average value of.

The non-transitory memory may be a physical device used to store programs (e.g., sequences of instructions) or data (e.g., program state information) on a temporary or permanent basis for use by the computing device. The non-transitory memory may be volatile and/or non-volatile addressable semiconductor memory. Examples of non-volatile memory include, but are not limited to, flash memory and Read Only Memory (ROM)/Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM)/Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM)/Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM) (e.g., typically used for firmware, such as boot programs). Examples of volatile memory include, but are not limited to, Random Access Memory (RAM), Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), Phase Change Memory (PCM), and magnetic disks or tape.
Fig. 6 is a schematic diagram of an example computing device 600 that may be used to implement the systems and methods (e.g., calibrator 300) and methods (e.g., methods 400, 500) described in this document. Computing device 600 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be exemplary only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the inventions described and/or claimed in this document.
The memory 620 non-temporarily stores information within the computing device 600. The memory 620 may be a computer-readable medium, a volatile memory unit, or a nonvolatile memory unit. The non-transitory memory 620 may be a physical device for storing programs (e.g., sequences of instructions) or data (e.g., program state information) on a temporary or permanent basis for use by the computing device 600. Examples of non-volatile memory include, but are not limited to, flash memory and Read Only Memory (ROM)/Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM)/Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM)/Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM) (e.g., typically used for firmware, such as boot programs). Examples of volatile memory include, but are not limited to, Random Access Memory (RAM), Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), Phase Change Memory (PCM), and magnetic disks or tape.
The storage device 630 can provide mass storage for the computing device 600. In some implementations, the storage device 630 is a computer-readable medium. In various different implementations, the storage device 630 may be a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state storage device or array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. In additional implementations, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as the methods described above. The information carrier is a computer-or machine-readable medium, such as the memory 620, the storage device 630, or memory on processor 610.
The high-speed controller 640 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for the computing device 600, while the low-speed controller 660 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. This allocation of responsibilities is merely exemplary. In some implementations, the high-speed controller 640 is coupled to memory 620, display 680 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 650, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In some implementations, the low-speed controller 660 is coupled to the storage device 630 and the low-speed expansion port 690. The low-speed expansion port 690, which can include various communication ports (e.g., USB, bluetooth, ethernet, wireless ethernet), can be coupled (e.g., through a network adapter) to one or more input/output devices such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a networking device such as a switch or router.
As shown in the figure, computing device 600 may be implemented in many different forms. For example, it may be implemented as a standard server 600a or multiple times in a group of such servers 600a, as a laptop computer 600b, or as part of a rack server system 600 c. In some examples, the computing device 600 may be partially or fully implemented as part of the ONU 140 in the optical communication system 100.
Various implementations of the systems and techniques described here can be realized in digital electronic and/or optical circuits, integrated circuits, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof. These various implementations can include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.
These computer programs (also known as programs, software applications or code) include machine instructions for a programmable processor, and can be implemented in a high-level procedural and/or object-oriented programming language, and/or in assembly/machine language. As used herein, the terms "machine-readable medium" and "computer-readable medium" refer to any computer program product, non-transitory computer-readable medium, apparatus and/or device (e.g., magnetic discs, optical disks, memory, Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs)) used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor, including a machine-readable medium that receives machine instructions as a machine-readable signal. The term "machine-readable signal" refers to any signal used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor.
The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Computer-readable media suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices (e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices); magnetic disks (e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks, magneto-optical disks, and CD ROM and DVD-ROM disks). The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
To provide for interaction with a user, one or more aspects of the disclosure can be implemented on a computer having a display device; such as a CRT (cathode ray tube), LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor or touch screen for displaying information to the user and, optionally, a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can also be used to provide for interaction with the user.
