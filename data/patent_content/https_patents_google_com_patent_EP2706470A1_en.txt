Definitions
- the present specification relates to identifying results of a query based on a natural language query and environmental information, for example to answer questions using environmental information as context.
- a search query includes one or more terms that a user submits to a search engine when the user requests the search engine to execute a search.
- a user may enter query terms of a search query by typing on a keyboard or, in the context of a voice query, by speaking the query terms into a microphone of a mobile device.
- Voice queries may be processed using speech recognition technology.
- environmental information such as ambient noise
- a user may ask a question about a television program that they are viewing, such as "What actor is in this movie?"
- the user's mobile device detects the user's utterance and environmental data, which may include the soundtrack audio of the television program.
- the mobile computing device encodes the utterance and the environmental data as waveform data, and provides the waveform data to a server-based computing environment.
- the computing environment separates the utterance from the environmental data of the waveform data, and then obtains a transcription of the utterance.
- the computing environment further identifies entity data relating to the environmental data and the utterance, such as by identifying the name of the movie. From the transcription and the entity data, the computing environment can then identify one or more results, for example, results in response to the user's question.
- the one or more results can include an answer to the user's question of "What actor is in this movie?" ( e.g. , the name of the actor).
- the computing environment can provide such results to the user of the mobile computing device.
- Generating the query includes associating the transcription with the data that identifies the entity. Associating further includes tagging the transcription with the data that identifies the entity. Associating further includes substituting a portion of the transcription with the data that identifies the entity. Substituting further includes substituting one or more words of the transcription with the data that identifies the entity.
- Receiving the environmental data further includes receiving environmental audio data, environmental image data, or both. Receiving the environmental audio data further includes receiving additional audio data that includes background noise.
- an item of media content is identified based on environmental audio data and a spoken natural language query. For example, a user may ask a question about a television program that they are viewing, such as "what are we watching right now?" The question may include keywords, such as "watching,” that suggest that the question is about a television show and not some other type of media content.
- the user's mobile device detects the user's utterance and environmental data, which may include the soundtrack audio of the television program.
- the mobile computing device encodes the utterance and the environmental data as waveform data, and provides the waveform data to a server-based computing environment.
- the computing environment separates the utterance from the environmental data of the waveform data, and then processes the utterance to obtain a transcription of the utterance. From the transcription, the computing environment detects any content type-specific keywords, such as the keyword "watching.” The computing environment can then identify items of media content based on the environmental data, and can select a particular item of media content, from among the identified items, that matches the particular content type associated with the keywords. The computing environment provides a representation of the particular item of media content to the user of the mobile computing device.
- inventions described in this specification may be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving (i) audio data that encodes a spoken natural language query, and (ii) environmental audio data, obtaining a transcription of the spoken natural language query, determining a particular content type associated with one or more keywords in the transcription, providing at least a portion of the environmental audio data to a content recognition engine, and identifying a content item that has been output by the content recognition engine, and that matches the particular content type.
- the particular content type is a movie content type, a music content type, a television show content type, an audio podcast content type, a book content type, an artwork content type, a trailer content type, a video podcast content type, an Internet video content type, or a video game content type.
- Receiving the environmental audio data further includes receiving additional audio data that includes background noise. The background noise is associated with the particular content type.
- Receiving additional environmental data that includes video data or image data is associated with the particular content type.

- the content recognition engine 110 is an audio fingerprinting engine that utilizes content fingerprinting using wavelets to identify the content item data. Specifically, the content recognition engine 110 converts the waveform data 114 into a spectrogram. From the spectrogram, the content recognition engine 110 extracts spectral images. The spectral images can be represented as wavelets. For each of the spectral images that are extracted from the spectrogram, the content recognition engine 110 extracts the "top" wavelets based on the respective magnitudes of the wavelets. For each spectral image, the content recognition engine 110 computes a wavelet signature of the image. In some examples, the wavelet signatures is a truncated, quantized version of the wavelet decomposition of the image.
- m ⁇ n wavelets are returned without compression.
- the content recognition engine 110 utilizes a subset of the wavelets that most characterize the song. Specifically, the t "top" wavelets (by magnitude) are selected, where t ⁇ m ⁇ n .

- This application claims the benefit of
U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/698,934, filed September 10, 2012 U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/698,949, filed September 10, 2012 U.S. Patent Application No. 13/626,439, filed September 25, 2012 U.S. Patent Application No. 13/626,351, filed September 25, 2012 U.S. Patent Application No. 13/768,232, filed February 15, 2013 - The present specification relates to identifying results of a query based on a natural language query and environmental information, for example to answer questions using environmental information as context.
- In general a search query includes one or more terms that a user submits to a search engine when the user requests the search engine to execute a search. Among other approaches, a user may enter query terms of a search query by typing on a keyboard or, in the context of a voice query, by speaking the query terms into a microphone of a mobile device. Voice queries may be processed using speech recognition technology.
- According to some innovative aspects of the subject matter described in this specification, environmental information, such as ambient noise, may aid a query processing system in answering a natural language query. For example, a user may ask a question about a television program that they are viewing, such as "What actor is in this movie?" The user's mobile device detects the user's utterance and environmental data, which may include the soundtrack audio of the television program. The mobile computing device encodes the utterance and the environmental data as waveform data, and provides the waveform data to a server-based computing environment.
- The computing environment separates the utterance from the environmental data of the waveform data, and then obtains a transcription of the utterance. The computing environment further identifies entity data relating to the environmental data and the utterance, such as by identifying the name of the movie. From the transcription and the entity data, the computing environment can then identify one or more results, for example, results in response to the user's question. Specifically, the one or more results can include an answer to the user's question of "What actor is in this movie?" (e.g., the name of the actor). The computing environment can provide such results to the user of the mobile computing device.
- Innovative aspects of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving audio data encoding an utterance and environmental data, obtaining a transcription of the utterance, identifying an entity using the environmental data, submitting a query to a natural language query processing engine, wherein the query includes at least a portion of the transcription and data that identifies the entity, and obtaining one or more results of the query.
- Other embodiments of these aspects include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- These and other embodiments may each optionally include one or more of the following features. For instance, outputting a representation of at least one of the results. The entity is identified further using the utterance. Generating the query. Generating the query includes associating the transcription with the data that identifies the entity. Associating further includes tagging the transcription with the data that identifies the entity. Associating further includes substituting a portion of the transcription with the data that identifies the entity. Substituting further includes substituting one or more words of the transcription with the data that identifies the entity. Receiving the environmental data further includes receiving environmental audio data, environmental image data, or both. Receiving the environmental audio data further includes receiving additional audio data that includes background noise.
- According to some innovative aspects of the subject matter described in this specification, an item of media content is identified based on environmental audio data and a spoken natural language query. For example, a user may ask a question about a television program that they are viewing, such as "what are we watching right now?" The question may include keywords, such as "watching," that suggest that the question is about a television show and not some other type of media content. The user's mobile device detects the user's utterance and environmental data, which may include the soundtrack audio of the television program. The mobile computing device encodes the utterance and the environmental data as waveform data, and provides the waveform data to a server-based computing environment.
- The computing environment separates the utterance from the environmental data of the waveform data, and then processes the utterance to obtain a transcription of the utterance. From the transcription, the computing environment detects any content type-specific keywords, such as the keyword "watching." The computing environment can then identify items of media content based on the environmental data, and can select a particular item of media content, from among the identified items, that matches the particular content type associated with the keywords. The computing environment provides a representation of the particular item of media content to the user of the mobile computing device.
- Innovative aspects of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving (i) audio data that encodes a spoken natural language query, and (ii) environmental audio data, obtaining a transcription of the spoken natural language query, determining a particular content type associated with one or more keywords in the transcription, providing at least a portion of the environmental audio data to a content recognition engine, and identifying a content item that has been output by the content recognition engine, and that matches the particular content type.
- Other embodiments of these aspects include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- These and other embodiments may each optionally include one or more of the following features. For instance, the particular content type is a movie content type, a music content type, a television show content type, an audio podcast content type, a book content type, an artwork content type, a trailer content type, a video podcast content type, an Internet video content type, or a video game content type. Receiving the environmental audio data further includes receiving additional audio data that includes background noise. The background noise is associated with the particular content type. Receiving additional environmental data that includes video data or image data. The video data or the image data is associated with the particular content type. Providing at least the portion of the environmental audio data to the content recognition engine further includes providing the portion of the environmental audio data to an audio fingerprinting engine. Determining the particular content type further includes identifying the one or more keywords using one or more databases that, for each of multiple content types, maps at least one of the keywords to at least one of the multiple content types. The multiple content types includes the particular content type, and wherein mapping further includes mapping at least one of the keywords to the particular content type. Outputting data identifying the content item.
- The features further include, for example, providing further includes providing data identifying the particular content type to the content recognition engine, and identifying the content item further includes receiving data identifying the content item from the content recognition engine. Receiving two or more content recognition candidates from the content recognition system, and identifying the content item further includes selecting a particular content recognition candidate based on the particular content type. Each of the two or more content recognition candidates is associated with a ranking score, the method further including adjusting the ranking scores of the two or more content recognition candidates based on the particular content type. Ranking the two or more content recognition candidates based on the adjusted ranking scores.
- The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other potential features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- A computing environment that answers spoken natural language queries using environmental information as context may process queries using multiple processes. In an example of some processes, illustrated in
FIGS. 1 to 4 , the computing environment can identify media content based on environmental information, such as ambient noises. In an example of other processes, illustrated inFIGS. 5 and6 , a computing environment can augment the spoken natural language query with context that is derived from the environmental information, such as data that identifies media content, in order to provide a more satisfying answer to the spoken natural language query. - In more detail,
FIG. 1 depicts asystem 100 for identifying content item data based on environmental audio data and a spoken natural language query. Briefly, thesystem 100 can identify content item data that is based on the environmental audio data and that matches a particular content type associated with the spoken natural language query. Thesystem 100 includes amobile computing device 102, adisambiguation engine 104, aspeech recognition engine 106, akeyword mapping engine 108, and acontent recognition engine 110. Themobile computing device 102 is in communication with thedisambiguation engine 104 over one or more networks. Themobile device 110 can include a microphone, a camera, or other detection mechanisms for detecting utterances from auser 112 and/or environmental data associated with theuser 112. - In some examples, the
user 112 is watching a television program. In the illustrated example, theuser 112 would like to know who directed the television program that is currently playing. In some examples, theuser 112 may not know the name of the television program that is currently playing, and may therefore ask the question "Who directed this show?" Themobile computing device 102 detects this utterance, as well as environmental audio data associated with the environment of theuser 112. - In some examples, the environmental audio data associated with the environment of the
user 112 can include background noise of the environment of theuser 112. For example, the environmental audio data includes the sounds of the television program. In some examples, the environmental audio data that is associated with the currently displayed television program can include audio of the currently displayed television program (e.g., dialogue of the currently displayed television program, soundtrack audio associated with the currently displayed television program, etc.). - In some examples, the
mobile computing device 102 detects the environmental audio data after detecting the utterance; detects the environmental audio data concurrently with detecting the utterance; or both. Themobile computing device 102 processes the detected utterance and the environmental audio data to generatewaveform data 114 that represents the detected utterance and the environmental audio data and transmits thewaveform data 114 to the disambiguation engine 104 (e.g., over a network), during operation (A). In some examples, the environmental audio data is streamed from themobile computing device 110. - The
disambiguation engine 104 receives thewaveform data 114 from themobile computing device 102. Thedisambiguation engine 104 processes thewaveform data 114, including separating (or extracting) the utterance from other portions of thewaveform data 114 and transmits the utterance to the speech recognition engine 106 (e.g., over a network), during operation (B). For example, thedisambiguation engine 104 separates the utterance ("Who directed this show?") from the background noise of the environment of the user 112 (e.g., audio of the currently displayed television program). - In some examples, the
disambiguation engine 104 utilizes a voice detector to facilitate separation of the utterance from the background noise by identifying a portion of thewaveform data 114 that includes voice activity, or voice activity associated with the user of thecomputing device 102. In some examples, the utterance relates to a query (e.g., a query relating to the currently displayed television program). In some examples, thewaveform data 114 includes the detected utterance. In response, thedisambiguation engine 104 can request the environmental audio data from themobile computing device 102 relating to the utterance. - The
speech recognition engine 106 receives the portion of thewaveform data 114 that corresponds to the utterance from thedisambiguation engine 104. Thespeech recognition engine 106 obtains a transcription of the utterance and provides the transcription to thekeyword mapping engine 108, during operation (C). Specifically, thespeech recognition engine 106 processes the utterance received from thespeech recognition engine 106. In some examples, processing of the utterance by thespeech recognition system 106 includes generating a transcription of the utterance. Generating the transcription of the utterance can include transcribing the utterance into text or text-related data. In other words, thespeech recognition system 106 can provide a representation of language in written form of the utterance. - For example, the
speech recognition system 106 transcribes the utterance to generate the transcription of "Who directed this show?" In some embodiments, thespeech recognition system 106 provides two or more transcriptions of the utterance. For example, thespeech recognition system 106 transcribes the utterance to generate the transcriptions of "Who directed this show?" and "Who directed this shoe?" - The
keyword mapping engine 108 receives the transcription from thespeech recognition engine 106. Thekeyword mapping engine 108 identifies one or more keywords in the transcription that are associated with a particular content type and provides the particular content type to thedisambiguation engine 104, during operation (D). In some embodiments, the one or more content types can include 'movie', 'music', 'television show', 'audio podcast', 'image,' 'artwork,' 'book,' 'magazine,' 'trailer,' 'video podcast', 'Internet video', or 'video game'. - For example, the
keyword mapping engine 108 identifies the keyword "directed" from the transcription of "Who directed this show?" The keyword "directed" is associated with the 'television show' content type. In some embodiments, a keyword of the transcription that is identified by thekeyword mapping engine 108 is associated with two or more content types. For example, the keyword "directed" is associated with the 'television show' and 'movie' content types. - In some embodiments, the
keyword mapping engine 108 identifies two or more keywords in the transcription that are associated with a particular content type. For example, thekeyword mapping engines 108 identifies the keywords "directed" and "show" that are associated with a particular content type. In some embodiments, the identified two or more keywords are associated with the same content type. For example, the identified keywords "directed" and "show" are both associated with the 'television show' content type. In some embodiments, the identified two or more keywords are associated with differing content types. For example, the identified keyword "directed" is associated with the 'movie' content type and the identified keyword "show" is associated with the 'television show' content type. Thekeyword mapping engine 108 transmits (e.g., over a network) the particular content type to thedisambiguation engine 108. - In some embodiments, the
keyword mapping engine 108 identifies the one or more keywords in the transcription that are associated with a particular content type using one or more databases that, for each of multiple content types, maps at least one of the keywords to at least one of the multiple content types. Specifically, thekeyword mapping engine 108 includes (or is in communication with) a database (or multiple databases). The database includes, or is associated with, a mapping between keywords and content types. Specifically, the database provides a connection (e.g., mapping) between the keywords and the content types such that thekeyword mapping engine 108 is able to identify one or more keywords in the transcription that are associated with particular content types. - In some embodiments, one or more of the mappings between the keywords and the content types can include a unidirectional (e.g., one-way) mapping (i.e., a mapping from the keywords to the content types). In some embodiments, one or more of the mappings between the keywords and the content types can include a bidirectional (e.g., two-way) mapping (i.e., a mapping from the keywords to the content types and from the content types to the keywords). In some embodiments, the one or more databases maps one or more of the keywords to two or more content types.
- For example, the
keyword mapping engine 108 uses the one or more databases that maps the keyword "directed" to the 'movie' and 'television show' content types. In some embodiments, the mapping between the keywords and the content types can include mappings between multiple, varying versions of a root keyword (e.g., the word family) and the content types. The differing versions of the keyword can include differing grammatical categories such as tense (e.g., past, present, future) and word class (e.g., noun, verb). For example, the database can include mappings of the word family of the root word "direct" such as "directors," "direction," and "directed" to the one or more content types. - The
disambiguation engine 104 receives data identifying the particular content type associated with the transcription of the utterance from thekeyword mapping engine 108. Furthermore, as mentioned above, thedisambiguation engine 104 receives thewaveform data 114 from themobile computing device 102 that includes the environmental audio data associated with the utterance. Thedisambiguation engine 104 then provides the environmental audio data and the particular content type to thecontent recognition engine 110, during operation (E). - For example, the
disambiguation engine 104 transmits the environmental audio data relating to the currently displayed television program that includes audio of the currently displayed television program (e.g., dialogue of the currently displayed television program, soundtrack audio associated with the currently displayed television program, etc.) and the particular content type of the transcription of the utterance (e.g., 'television show' content type) to thecontent recognition engine 110. - In some embodiments, the
disambiguation engine 104 provides a portion of the environmental audio data to thecontent recognition engine 110. In some examples, the portion of the environmental audio data can include background noise detected by themobile computing device 102 after detecting the utterance. In some examples, the portion of the environmental audio data can include background noise detected by themobile computing device 102 concurrently with detecting the utterance. - In some embodiments, the background noise (of the waveform data 114) is associated with a particular content type that is associated with a keyword of the transcription. For example, the keyword "directed" of the transcription "Who directed this show?" is associated with the 'television show' content type, and the background noise (e.g., the environmental audio data relating to the currently displayed television program) is also associated with the 'television show' content type.
- The
content recognition engine 110 receives the environmental audio data and the particular content type from thedisambiguation engine 104. Thecontent recognition engine 110 identifies content item data that is based on the environmental audio data and that matches the particular content type and provides the content item data to thedisambiguation engine 104, during operation (F). Specifically, thecontent recognition engine 110 appropriately processes the environmental audio data to identify content item data that is associated with the environmental audio data (e.g., a name of a television show, a name of a song, etc.). Additionally, thecontent recognition engine 110 matches the identified content item data with the particular content type (e.g., content type of the transcription of the utterance). Thecontent recognition engine 110 transmits (e.g., over a network) the identified content item data to thedisambiguation engine 104. - For example, the
content recognition engine 110 identifies content item data that is based on the environmental audio data relating to the currently displayed television program, and further that matches the 'television show' content type. To that end, thecontent recognition engine 110 can identify content item data based on dialogue of the currently displayed television program, or soundtrack audio associated with the currently displayed television program, depending on the portion of the environmental audio data received by thecontent recognition engine 110. - In some embodiments, the
content recognition engine 110 is an audio fingerprinting engine that utilizes content fingerprinting using wavelets to identify the content item data. Specifically, thecontent recognition engine 110 converts thewaveform data 114 into a spectrogram. From the spectrogram, thecontent recognition engine 110 extracts spectral images. The spectral images can be represented as wavelets. For each of the spectral images that are extracted from the spectrogram, thecontent recognition engine 110 extracts the "top" wavelets based on the respective magnitudes of the wavelets. For each spectral image, thecontent recognition engine 110 computes a wavelet signature of the image. In some examples, the wavelet signatures is a truncated, quantized version of the wavelet decomposition of the image. - For example, to describe an m×n image with wavelets, m×n wavelets are returned without compression. Additionally, the
content recognition engine 110 utilizes a subset of the wavelets that most characterize the song. Specifically, the t "top" wavelets (by magnitude) are selected, where t << m×n. Furthermore, thecontent recognition engine 110 creates a compact representation of the sparse wavelet-vector described above, for example, using MinHash to compute sub-fingerprints for these sparse bit vectors. - In some examples, when the environmental audio data includes at least the soundtrack audio associated with the currently displayed television program, the
content recognition engine 110 identifies content item data that is based on the soundtrack audio associated with the currently displayed television program and that also matches the 'television show' content type. Thus, in some examples, thecontent recognition engine 110 identifies content item data relating to a name of the currently displayed television program. For example, thecontent recognition engine 110 can determine that a particular content item (e.g., a specific television show) is associated with a theme song (e.g., the soundtrack audio), and that the particular content item (e.g., the specific television show) matches the particular content type (e.g., 'television show' content type). Thus, thecontent recognition engine 110 can identify data (e.g., the name of the specific television show) that relates to the particular content item (e.g., the currently displayed television program) that is based on the environmental audio data (e.g., the soundtrack audio), and further that matches the particular content type (e.g., 'television show' content type). - The
disambiguation engine 104 receives the identified content item data from thecontent recognition engine 110. Thedisambiguation engine 104 then provides the identified content item data to themobile computing device 102, at operation (G). For example, thedisambiguation engine 104 transmits the identified content item data relating to the currently displayed television program (e.g., a name of the currently displayed television program) to themobile computing device 102. - In some examples, one or more of the
mobile computing device 102, thedisambiguation engine 104, thespeech recognition engine 106, thekeyword mapping engine 108, and thecontent recognition engine 110 can be in communication with a subset (or each) of themobile computing device 102, thedisambiguation engine 104, thespeech recognition engine 106, thekeyword mapping engine 108, and thecontent recognition engine 110. In some embodiments, one or more of thedisambiguation engine 104, thespeech recognition engine 106, thekeyword mapping engine 108, and thecontent recognition engine 110 can be implemented using one or more computing devices, such as one or more computing servers, a distributed computing system, or a server farm or cluster. - In some embodiments, as mentioned above, the environmental audio data is streamed from the
mobile computing device 110 to thedisambiguation engine 104. When the environmental audio data is streamed, the above-mentioned process (e.g., operations (A)-(H)) is performed as the environmental audio data is received by the disambiguation engine 104 (i.e., performed incrementally). In other words, as each portion of the environmental audio data is received by (e.g., streamed to) thedisambiguation engine 104, operations (A)-(H) are performed iteratively until content item data is identified. -
FIG. 2 depicts a flowchart of anexample process 200 for identifying content item data based on environmental audio data and a spoken natural language query. Theexample process 200 can be executed using one or more computing devices. For example, themobile computing device 102, thedisambiguation engine 104, thespeech recognition engine 106, thekeyword mapping engine 108, and/or thecontent recognition engine 110 can be used to execute theexample process 200. - Audio data that encodes a spoken natural language query and environmental audio data is received (202). For example, the
disambiguation engine 104 receives thewaveform data 114 from themobile computing device 102. Thewaveform data 114 includes the spoken natural query of the user (e.g., "Who directed this show?") and the environmental audio data (e.g., audio of the currently displayed television program). Thedisambiguation engine 104 separates the spoken natural language query ("Who directed this show?") from the background noise of the environment of the user 112 (e.g., audio of the currently displayed television program). - A transcription of the natural language query is obtained (204). For example, the
speech recognition system 106 transcribes the natural language query to generate a transcription of the natural language query (e.g., "Who directed this show?"). - A particular content type that is associated with one or more keywords in the transcription is determined (206). For example, the
keyword mapping engine 108 identifies one or more keywords (e.g., "directed") in the transcription (e.g., "Who directed this show?") that are associated with a particular content type (e.g., 'television show' content type). In some embodiments, thekeyword mapping engine 108 determines the particular content type that is associated with one or more keywords in the transcription using one or more databases that, for each of multiple content types, maps at least one of the keywords to at least one of the multiple content types. The database provides a connection (e.g., mapping) between the keywords (e.g., "directed") and the content types (e.g., 'television show' content type). - At least a portion of the environmental audio data is provided to a content recognition engine (208). For example, the
disambiguation engine 104 provides at least the portion the environmental audio data encoded by the waveform data 114 (e.g., audio of the currently displayed television program) to thecontent recognition engine 110. In some examples, thedisambiguation engine 104 also provides the particular content type (e.g. 'television show' content type) that is associated with the one or more keywords (e.g., "directed") in the transcription to thecontent recognition engine 110. - A content item is identified that is output by the content recognition engine, and that matches the particular content type (210). For example, the
content recognition engine 110 identifies a content item or content item data that is based on the environmental audio data (e.g., audio of the currently displayed television program) and that matches the particular content type (e.g. 'television show' content type). -

FIG. 3A depicts theportion 300a including thecontent recognition engine 310a. Thecontent recognition engine 310a is able to identify content item data based on environmental data and that matches a particular content type. In other words, thecontent recognition engine 310a is able to appropriately process the environmental data to identify content item data based on the environmental data, and further select one or more of the identified content item data such that the selected content item data matches the particular content type. - Specifically, the
disambiguation engine 304a provides the environmental data and the particular content type to thecontent recognition engine 310a, during operation (A). In some embodiments, thedisambiguation engine 304a provides a portion of the environmental data to thecontent recognition engine 310a. - The
content recognition engine 310a receives the environmental data and the particular content type from thedisambiguation engine 304a. Thecontent recognition engine 310a then identifies content item data that is based on the environmental data and that matches the particular content type and provides the identified content item data to thedisambiguation engine 304a, during operation (B). Specifically, thecontent recognition engine 310a identifies content item data (e.g., a name of a television show, a name of a song, etc.) that is based on the environmental data. Thecontent recognition engine 310a then selects one or more of the identified content item data that matches the particular content type. In other words, thecontent recognition engine 310a filters the identified content item data based on the particular content type. Thecontent recognition engine 310a transmits (e.g., over a network) the identified content item data to thedisambiguation engine 304a. - In some examples, when the environmental data includes at least soundtrack audio associated with a currently displayed television program, as mentioned above with respect to
FIG. 1 , thecontent recognition engine 310a identifies content item data that is based on the soundtrack audio associated with the currently displayed television program. Thecontent recognition engine 310a then filters the identified content item data based on the 'television show' content type. For example, thecontent recognition engine 310a identifies a 'theme song name' and a 'TV show name' associated with the soundtrack audio. Thecontent recognition engine 310a then filters the identified content item data such that the identified content item data also matches the 'television show' content type. For example, thecontent recognition engine 310a selects the 'TV show name' identifying data, and transmits the 'TV show name' identifying data to thedisambiguation engine 304a. - In some examples, the
content recognition engine 310a selects a corpus (or index) based on the content type (e.g., 'television show' content type). Specifically, thecontent recognition engine 310a can have access to a first index relating to the 'television show' content type and a second index relating to a 'movie' content type. Thecontent recognition engine 310a appropriately selects the first index based on the 'television show' content type. Thus, by selecting the first index (and not selecting the second index), thecontent recognition engine 310a can more efficiently identify the content item data (e.g., a name of the television show). - The
disambiguation engine 304a receives the content item data from thecontent recognition engine 310a. For example, thedisambiguation engine 304a receives the 'TV show name' identifying data from thecontent recognition engine 310a. Thedisambiguation engine 304a then provides the identifying data to a third party (e.g., themobile computing device 102 ofFIG.1 ), during operation (C). For example, thedisambiguation engine 304a provides the 'TV show name' identifying data to the third party. -
FIG. 3b depicts theportion 300b including thecontent recognition engine 310b. Thecontent recognition engine 310b is able to identify content item data based on environmental data. In other words, thecontent recognition engine 310b is able to appropriately process the environmental data to identify content item data based on the environmental data, and provide the content item data to thedisambiguation engine 304b. Thedisambiguation engine 310b selects one or more of the identified content item data such that the selected content item data matches the particular content type. - Specifically, the
disambiguation engine 304b provides the environmental data to thecontent recognition engine 310b, during operation (A). In some embodiments, thedisambiguation engine 304b provides a portion of the environmental data to thecontent recognition engine 310b. - The
content recognition engine 310b receives the environmental data from thedisambiguation engine 304b. Thecontent recognition engine 310b then identifies content item data that is based on the environmental data and provides the identified content item data to thedisambiguation engine 304b, during operation (B). Specifically, thecontent recognition engine 310b identifies content item data associated with two or more content items (e.g., a name of a television show, a name of a song, etc.) that is based on the environmental data. Thecontent recognition engine 310b transmits (e.g., over a network) two or more candidates representing the identified content item data to thedisambiguation engine 304b. - In some examples, when the environmental data includes at least soundtrack audio associated with a currently displayed television program, as mentioned above with respect to
FIG. 1 , thecontent recognition engine 310b identifies content item data relating to two or more content items that is based on the soundtrack audio associated with the currently displayed television program. For example, thecontent recognition engine 310b identifies a 'theme song name' and a 'TV show name' associated with the soundtrack audio, and transmits the 'theme song name' and 'TV show name' identifying data to thedisambiguation engine 304b. - The
disambiguation engine 304b receives the two or more candidates from thecontent recognition engine 310b. For example, thedisambiguation engine 304b receives the 'theme song name' and 'TV show name' candidates from thecontent recognition engine 310b. Thedisambiguation engine 304b then selects one of the two or more candidates based on a particular content type and provides the selected candidate to a third party (e.g., themobile computing device 102 ofFIG. 1 ), during operation (C). Specifically, thedisambiguation engine 304b previously receives the particular content type (e.g., that is associated with an utterance), as described above with respect toFIG. 1 . Thedisambiguation engine 304b selects a particular candidate of the two or more candidates based on the particular content type. Specifically, thedisambiguation engine 304b selects the particular candidate of the two or more candidates that matches the particular content type. For example, thedisambiguation engine 304b selects the 'TV show name' candidate as the 'TV show name' candidate matches the 'television show' content type. - In some embodiments, the two or more candidates from the
content recognition engine 310b are associated with a ranking score. The ranking score can be associated with any scoring metric as determined by thedisambiguation engine 304b. Thedisambiguation engine 304b can further adjust the ranking score of two or more candidates based on the particular content type. Specifically, thedisambiguation engine 304b can increase the ranking score of one or more of the candidates when the respective candidates are matched to the particular content type. For example, the ranking score of the candidate 'TV show name' can be increased as it matches the 'television show' content type. Furthermore, thedisambiguation engine 304b can decrease the ranking score of one or more of the candidates when the respective candidates are not matched to the particular content type. For example, the ranking score of the candidate 'theme song name' can be decreased as it does not match the 'television show' content type. - In some embodiments, the two or more candidates can be ranked based on the respective adjusted ranking scores by the
disambiguation engine 304b. For example, thedisambiguation engine 304b can rank the 'TV show name' candidate above the 'theme song name' candidate as the 'TV show name' candidate has a higher adjusted ranking score as compared to the adjusted ranking score of the 'theme song name' candidate. In some examples, thedisambiguation engine 304b selects the candidate ranked highest (i.e., has the highest adjusted ranking score). -
FIG. 4 depicts asystem 400 for identifying content item data based on environmental image data and a spoken natural language query. In short, thesystem 400 can identify content item data that is based on the environmental image data and that matches a particular content type associated with the spoken natural language query. Thesystem 400 includes amobile computing device 402, adisambiguation engine 404, aspeech recognition engine 406, akeyword mapping engine 408, and acontent recognition engine 410, analogous to that of themobile computing device 102, thedisambiguation engine 104, thespeech recognition engine 106, thekeyword mapping engine 108, and thecontent recognition engine 110, respectively, ofsystem 100 illustrated inFIG. 1 . - In some examples, the
user 112 is looking at a CD album cover of a soundtrack of a movie. In the illustrated example, theuser 112 would like to know what songs are on the soundtrack. In some examples, theuser 112 may not know the name of the movie soundtrack, and may therefore ask the question "What songs are on this?" or "What songs play in this movie?" Themobile computing device 402 detects this utterance, as well as environmental image data associated with the environment of theuser 112. - In some examples, the environmental image data associated with the environment of the
user 112 can include image data of the environment of theuser 112. For example, the environmental image data includes an image of the CD album cover that depicts images related to the movie (e.g., an image of a movie poster of the associated movie). In some examples, themobile computing device 402 detects the environmental image data utilizing a camera of themobile computing device 402 that captures an image (or video) of the CD album cover. - The
mobile computing device 402 processes the detected utterance to generatewaveform data 414 that represents the detected utterance and transmits thewaveform data 414 and the environmental image data to the disambiguation engine 404 (e.g., over a network), during operation (A). - The
disambiguation engine 404 receives thewaveform data 414 and the environmental image data from themobile computing device 402. Thedisambiguation engine 404 processes thewaveform data 414 and transmits the utterance to the speech recognition engine 406 (e.g., over a network), during operation (B). In some examples, the utterance relates to a query (e.g., a query relating to the movie soundtrack). - The
speech recognition system 406 receives the utterance from thedisambiguation engine 404. Thespeech recognition system 406 obtains a transcription of the utterance and provides the transcription to thekeyword mapping engine 408, during operation (C). Specifically, thespeech recognition system 406 processes the utterance received from thespeech recognition engine 406 by generating a transcription of the utterance. - For example, the
speech recognition system 406 transcribes the utterance to generate the transcription of "What songs are on this?" In some embodiments, thespeech recognition system 406 provides two or more transcriptions of the utterance. For example, thespeech recognition system 406 transcribes the utterance to generate the transcriptions of "What songs are on this?" and "What sinks are on this?" - The
keyword mapping engine 408 receives the transcription from thespeech recognition engine 406. Thekeyword mapping engine 408 identifies one or more keywords in the transcription that are associated with a particular content type and provides the particular content type to thedisambiguation engine 404, during operation (D). - For example, the
keyword mapping engine 408 identifies the keyword "songs" from the transcription of "What songs are on this?" The keyword "songs" is associated with the 'music' content type. In some embodiments, a keyword of the transcription that is identified by thekeyword mapping engine 408 is associated with two or more content types. For example, the keyword "songs" is associated with the 'music' and 'singer' content types. Thekeyword mapping engine 408 transmits (e.g., over a network) the particular content type to thedisambiguation engine 408. - In some embodiments, analogous to that mentioned above, the
keyword mapping engine 408 identifies the one or more keywords in the transcription that are associated with a particular content type using one or more databases that, for each of multiple content types, maps at least one of the keywords to at least one of the multiple content types. For example, thekeyword mapping engine 408 uses the one or more databases that maps the keyword "songs" to the 'music' and 'singer' content types. - The
disambiguation engine 404 receives the particular content type associated with the transcription of the utterance from thekeyword mapping engine 408. Furthermore, as mentioned above, thedisambiguation engine 404 receives the environmental image data associated with the utterance. Thedisambiguation engine 404 then provides the environmental image data and the particular content type to thecontent recognition engine 410, during operation (E). - For example, the
disambiguation engine 404 transmits the environmental image data relating to the movie soundtrack (e.g., an image of the movie poster CD album cover) and the particular content type of the transcription of the utterance (e.g., 'music' content type) to thecontent recognition engine 410. - The
content recognition engine 410 receives the environmental image data and the particular content type from thedisambiguation engine 404. Thecontent recognition engine 410 then identifies content item data that is based on the environmental image data and that matches the particular content type and provides the identified content item data to thedisambiguation engine 404, during operation (F). Specifically, thecontent recognition engine 410 appropriately processes the environmental image data to identify content item data (e.g., a name of a content item). Additionally, thecontent recognition engine 410 matches the identified content item with the particular content type (e.g., content type of the transcription of the utterance). Thecontent recognition engine 408 transmits (e.g., over a network) the identified content item data to thedisambiguation engine 408. - For example, the
content recognition engine 410 identifies data that is based on the environmental image data relating to the image of the movie poster CD album cover, and further that matches the 'music' content type. - In some examples, when the environmental image data includes at least the movie poster image associated with the CD album cover, the
content recognition engine 410 identifies content item data that is based on the movie poster associated with the CD album cover and that also matches the 'music' content type. Thus, in some examples, thecontent recognition engine 410 identifies content item data relating to a name of the movie soundtrack. For example, thecontent recognition engine 410 can determine that a particular content item (e.g., a specific movie soundtrack) is associated with a movie poster, and that the particular content item (e.g., the specific movie soundtrack) matches the particular content type (e.g., 'music' content type). Thus, thecontent recognition 410 can identify data (e.g., the name of the specific movie soundtrack) that relates to the particular content item (e.g., the specific movie soundtrack) that is based on the environmental image data (e.g., the image of the CD album cover), and further that matches the particular content type (e.g., 'music' content type). - The
disambiguation engine 404 receives the identified content item data from thecontent recognition engine 410. Thedisambiguation engine 404 then provides the identified content item data to themobile computing device 402, at operation (G). For example, thedisambiguation engine 404 transmits the identified content item data relating to the movie soundtrack (e.g., a name of the movie soundtrack) to themobile computing device 402. - As noted above,
FIGS. 1 to 4 illustrate several example processes in which the computing environment can identify media content (or other content) based on environmental information, such as ambient noises. Other processes for identifying content can also be used. Generally,FIGS. 5 and6 illustrate other example processes in which a computing environment can augment the spoken natural language query with context that is derived from the environmental information, such as data that identifies media content, in order to provide a more satisfying answer to the spoken natural language query. - In more detail,
FIG. 5 depicts asystem 500 for identifying one or more results based on environmental audio data and an utterance. In some examples, the one or more results can represent one or more answers to a natural language query. Thesystem 500 includes amobile computing device 502, acoordination engine 504, aspeech recognition engine 506, acontent identification engine 508, and a natural languagequery processing engine 510. Themobile computing device 502 is in communication with thecoordination engine 504 over one or more networks. Themobile device 510 can include a microphone, a camera, or other detection mechanisms for detecting utterances from auser 512 and/or environmental data associated with theuser 512. - Similar to the
system 100 ofFIG.1 , theuser 512 is watching a television program. In the illustrated example, theuser 512 would like to know who directed the television program (e.g., an entity) that is currently playing. In some examples, theuser 512 may not know the name of the television program that is currently playing, and may therefore ask the question "Who directed this show?" Themobile computing device 502 detects this utterance, as well as environmental data associated with the environment of theuser 512. - In some examples, the environmental data associated with the environment of the
user 512 can include background noise of the environment of theuser 512. For example, the environmental data includes the sounds of the television program (e.g., an entity). In some examples, the environmental data that is associated with the currently displayed television program can include audio of the currently displayed television program (e.g., dialogue of the currently displayed television program, soundtrack audio associated with the currently displayed television program, etc.). In some examples, the environmental data can include environmental audio data, environmental image data, or both. In some examples, themobile computing device 502 detects the environmental audio data after detecting the utterance; detects the environmental audio data concurrently with detecting the utterance; or both. Themobile computing device 502 processes the detected utterance and the environmental data to generatewaveform data 514 that represents the detected utterance and detected environmental audio data (e.g., the sounds of the television program) and transmits thewaveform data 514 to the coordination engine 504 (e.g., over a network), during operation (A). - The
coordination engine 504 receives thewaveform data 514 from themobile computing device 502. Thecoordination engine 504 processes thewaveform data 514, including separating (or extracting) the utterance from other portions of thewaveform data 514 and transmits the portion of thewaveform data 514 corresponding to the utterance to the speech recognition engine 506 (e.g., over a network), during operation (B). For example, thecoordination engine 504 separates the utterance ("Who directed this show?") from the background noise of the environment of the user 512 (e.g., audio of the currently displayed television program). In some examples, thecoordination engine 504 utilizes a voice detector to facilitate separation of the utterance from the background noise by identifying a portion of thewaveform data 514 that includes voice activity. In some examples, the utterance relates to a query (e.g., a query relating to the currently displayed television program). - The
speech recognition engine 506 receives the portion of thewaveform data 514 corresponding to the utterance from thecoordination engine 504. Thecoordination engine 506 obtains a transcription of the utterance and provides the transcription to thecoordination engine 504, during operation (C). Specifically, thespeech recognition system 506 appropriately processes the portion of thewaveform data 514 corresponding to the utterance received from thecoordination engine 504. In some examples, processing of the portion of thewaveform data 514 corresponding to the utterance by thespeech recognition engine 506 includes generating a transcription of the utterance. Generating the transcription of the utterance can include transcribing the utterance into text or text-related data. In other words, thespeech recognition engine 506 can provide a representation of language in written form of the utterance. - For example, the
speech recognition engine 506 transcribes the utterance to generate the transcription of "Who directed this show?" In some embodiments, thespeech recognition engine 506 provides two or more transcriptions of the utterance. For example, thespeech recognition engine 506 transcribes the utterance to generate the transcriptions of "Who directed this show?" and "Who directed this shoe?" - The
coordination engine 504 receives the transcription of the utterance from thespeech recognition engine 506. Furthermore, as mentioned above, thecoordination engine 504 receives thewaveform data 514 from themobile computing device 502 that includes the environmental audio data associated with the utterance. Thecoordination engine 504 then identifies an entity using the environmental data. Specifically, thecoordination engine 504 obtains data that identifies an entity from thecontent identification engine 508. To that end, thecoordination engine 504 provides the environmental audio data and the portion of thewaveform 514 corresponding to the utterance to the content identification engine 508 (e.g., over a network), during operation (D). - For example, the
coordination engine 504 transmits the environmental data relating to the currently displayed television program (e.g., the entity) that includes audio of the currently displayed television program (e.g., dialogue of the currently displayed television program, soundtrack audio associated with the currently displayed television program, etc.) and the portion of thewaveform 514 corresponding to the utterance ("Who directed this show?") to thecontent identification engine 508. - In some embodiments, the
coordination engine 504 provides a portion of the environmental data to thecontent identification engine 508. In some examples, the portion of the environmental data can include background noise detected by themobile computing device 502 after detecting the utterance. In some examples, the portion of the environmental data can include background noise detected by themobile computing device 502 concurrently with detecting the utterance. - The
content identification engine 508 receives the environmental data and the portion of thewaveform 514 corresponding to the utterance from thecoordination engine 504. Thecontent identification engine 508 identifies data that identifies the entity (e.g., content item data) that is based on the environmental data and the utterance and provides the data that identifies the entity to the coordination engine 504 (e.g., over a network), during operation (E). Specifically, thecontent identification engine 508 appropriately processes the environmental data and the portion of thewaveform 514 corresponding to the utterance to identify data that identifies the entity (e.g., content item data) that is associated with the environmental data (e.g., a name of a television show, a name of a song, etc.). - For example, the
content identification engine 508 processes the environmental audio data to identify content item data that is associated with the currently displayed television program. In some embodiments, thecontent identification engine 508 is thesystem 100 ofFIG. 1 . - The
coordination engine 504 receives the data that identifies the entity (e.g., the content item data) from thecontent identification engine 508. Furthermore, as mentioned above, thecoordination engine 504 receives the transcription from thespeech recognition engine 506. Thecoordination engine 504 then provides a query including the transcription and the data that identifies the entity to the natural language query processing engine 510 (e.g., over a network), during operation (F). For example, thecoordination engine 504 submits a query to the natural languagequery processing engine 510 that includes the transcription of the utterance ("Who directed this show?") and the content item data ('television show name') to the natural languagequery processing engine 510. - In some examples, the
coordination engine 504 generates the query. In some examples, thecoordination engine 504 obtains the query (e.g., from a third-party server). For example, thecoordination engine 504 can submit the transcription of the utterance, and the data that identifies the entity to the third-party server, and receive back the query based on the transcription and the data that identifies the entity. - In some embodiments, generating the query by the
coordination engine 504 can include associating the transcription of the utterance with the data that identifies the entity (e.g., the content item data). In some examples, associating the transcription of the utterance with the content item data can include tagging the transcription with the data that identifies the entity. For example, thecoordination engine 504 can tag the transcription "Who directed this show?" with the 'television show name' or other identifying information associated with the content item data (e.g., an identification (ID) number). In some examples, associating the transcription of the utterance with the data that identifies the entity can include substituting a portion of the transcription with the data that identifies the entity. For example, thecoordination engine 504 can substitute a portion of the transcription "Who directed this show?" with the 'television show name' or data identifying the 'television show name.' In some examples, substituting a portion of the transcription with the data that identifies the entity can include substituting one or more words of the transcription of the utterance with the data that identifies the entity. For example, thecoordination engine 504 can substitute the 'television show name' or data identifying the 'television show name' in the transcription of "Who directed this show?" For example, the substitution can result in the transcription including "Who directed 'television show name'?" or "Who directed 'ID number'?" - The natural language
query processing engine 510 receives the query that includes the transcription and the data that identifies the entity (e.g., the content item data) from thecoordination engine 504. The natural languagequery processing engine 510 appropriately processes the query and based on the processing, provides one or more results to the coordination engine 504 (e.g., over a network), during operation (G). In other words, thecoordination engine 510 obtains one or more results of the query (e.g., from the natural language query processing engine 510). - Specifically, the natural language
query processing engine 510 obtains information resources (from a collection of information resources) relevant to the query (the transcription of the utterance and the content item data). In some examples, the natural languagequery processing engine 510 matches the query against database information (e.g., text documents, images, audio, video, etc.) and a score is calculated on how well each object in the database matches the query. The natural languagequery processing engine 510 identifies one or more results based on the matched objects (e.g., objects having a score above a threshold score). - For example, the natural language
query processing engine 510 receives the query that includes the transcription of the utterance "Who directed this show" and the 'television show name' (or other identifying information). The natural languagequery processing engine 510 matches the query against database information, and provides one or more results that match the query. The natural languagequery processing engine 510 calculates a score of each of the matching objects. - The
coordination engine 504 receives the one or more results from the naturallanguage processing engine 510. Thecoordination engine 504 then provides the one or more results to the mobile computing device 502 (e.g., over a network), at operation (H). For example, thecoordination engine 504 transmits the one or more results (e.g., the name of the director of the television show) to themobile computing device 502. - In some examples, one or more of the
mobile computing device 502, thecoordination engine 504, thespeech recognition engine 506, thecontent identification engine 508, and the natural languagequery processing engine 510 can be in communication with a subset (or each) of themobile computing device 502, thecoordination engine 504, thespeech recognition engine 506, thecontent identification engine 508, and the natural languagequery processing engine 510. In some embodiments, one or more of thecoordination engine 504, thespeech recognition engine 506, thecontent identification engine 508, and the natural languagequery processing engine 510 can be implemented using one or more computing devices, such as one or more computing servers, a distributed computing system, or a server farm or cluster. -
FIG. 6 depicts a flowchart of anexample process 600 for identifying one or more results based on environmental data and an utterance. Theexample process 600 can be executed using one or more computing devices. For example, themobile computing device 502, thecoordination engine 504, thespeech recognition engine 506, thecontent identification engine 508, and/or the natural languagequery processing engine 510 can be used to execute theexample process 600. - Audio data that encodes an utterance and environmental data is received (602). For example, the
coordination engine 504 receives thewaveform data 514 from themobile computing device 502. Thewaveform data 514 includes the utterance of the user (e.g., "Who directed this show?") and the environmental data (e.g., audio of the currently displayed television program). In some examples, receiving the environmental data can include receiving environmental audio data, environmental image data, or both. In some examples, receiving the environmental data includes receiving additional audio data that includes background noise. - A transcription of the utterance is obtained (604). For example, the
coordination engine 504 obtains a transcription of the utterance using thespeech recognition engine 506. Thespeech recognition engine 506 transcribes the utterance to generate a transcription of the utterance (e.g., "Who directed this show?"). - An entity is identified using the environmental data (606). For example, the
coordination engine 504 obtains data identifying the entity using thecontent identification engine 508. Thecontent identification engine 508 can appropriately process the environmental data (e.g., the environmental audio data associated with the displayed television program) to identify data identifying the entity (e.g., content item data) that is associated with the environmental data (e.g., a name of a television show, a name of a song, etc.). In some examples, thecontent identification engine 508 can further process thewaveform 514 corresponding to the utterance (concurrently or subsequently to processing the environmental data) to identify the entity. - In some examples, the
coordination engine 504 generates a query. In some examples, generating of the query by thecoordination engine 504 can include associating the transcription of the utterance with the data that identifies the entity.
In some examples, associating the transcription of the utterance with the content item data can include substituting a portion of the transcription with the data that identifies the entity. In some example, substituting a portion of the transcription with the data that identifies the entity can include substituting one or more words of the transcription of the utterance with the data that identifies the entity. - The query is submitted to a natural language processing engine (608). For example, the
coordination engine 504 submits the query to the natural languagequery processing engine 510. The query can include at least a portion of the transcription and the data that identifies the entity (e.g., the content item data). For example, thecoordination engine 504 submits a query to the natural language query processing engine that includes the transcription of the utterance ("Who directed this show?") and the content item data ('television show name') to the natural languagequery processing engine 510. - One or more results of the query are obtained (610). For example, the
coordination engine 510 obtains one or more results (e.g., the name of the director of the television show) of the query from the natural languagequery processing engine 510. In some examples, thecoordination engine 504 then provides the one or more results to themobile computing device 502. -
FIG. 7 shows an example of ageneric computer device 700 and a genericmobile computer device 750, which may be used with the techniques described here.Computing device 700 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers.Computing device 750 is intended to represent various forms of mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, and other similar computing devices. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be exemplary only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the inventions described and/or claimed in this document. -
Computing device 700 includes aprocessor 702,memory 704, astorage device 706, a high-speed interface 708 connecting tomemory 704 and high-speed expansion ports 710, and alow speed interface 712 connecting tolow speed bus 714 andstorage device 706. Each of thecomponents processor 702 may process instructions for execution within thecomputing device 700, including instructions stored in thememory 704 or on thestorage device 706 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such asdisplay 716 coupled tohigh speed interface 708. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also,multiple computing devices 700 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system). - The
