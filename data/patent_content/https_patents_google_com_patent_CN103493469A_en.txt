Once completing steps 402, web server 104 is just further set up the communication link with CPW at step 404 place, such as the communication link 108 of the CPW 106 with in Fig. 1.Foundation at the communication link at step 404 place can comprise, for example, provides one or more web services to call out and/or other technologies.After step 404, web server 104 keeps communicating by letter with CPW106 is ongoing, and this communication can be (but needing not be) periodical communication, and, at place of one or more times, web server 104 obtains (pulling) information from CPW.The information obtained from CPW can comprise any the information of number of different types, for example comprise, about the information of contact person, particular message, news, unexpected event and the other types of contact person or friend's information (comprising contacts list), new friend or renewal, the information of these other types may comprise file (such as image file or text) or other forms of data.Once step 406 place acquired information, web server is just processed obtained information at step 408 place so.
With reference to figure 5, show according to the exemplary sub-step corresponding with step 406 Fig. 4 and 408 embodiment in addition.As show, step 406 (acquisition step) can be understood to include to start some sub-steps that sub-step 500 starts, and further comprises three other sub-steps 502,504 and 506.More specifically, in sub-step 502, web server 104 sends and pulls signal to CPW 106, and, at sub-step 504 places, at rear end part 306 places of web server, from CPW, receives the breath of writing in reply.After rear end part 306 places receive information, then at step 506 place, the rear end part forward end part 308 from web server 104 pushes this information.
And, as shown in Figure 5, in one embodiment, step 408 (treatment step) can be before sub-step 518 places finish, be included in some sub-steps that sub-step 508 starts (Fig. 5 shows the sub-step corresponding with step 408, and it is the continuation of the sub-step corresponding with step 406).More specifically, at sub-step 508 places, receive the information pushed from rear end part 306 in sub-step 506 once the fore-end 308 of web server 104, so just this information is placed in public transmission queue.Next, at sub-step 510 places, can compress alternatively this information.And, at sub-step 512 places, this information can be converted to different forms, for example binary format alternatively.As piece 509 (shown in broken lines) means in addition, the format conversion occurred at sub-step 512 places can comprise: the specific format information provided by CPW 106 is provided, so that the format of this information of standardization, and remove the specific format information of website, although be not the source identity, perhaps otherwise the format of information is revised as to unification or the general form provided to mobile device, and irrelevant with the CPW format in source as information.
Next, at sub-step 514 places, based on information, be that high material information or low material information are filtered information.As sub-step 511,513,515 and 517 (shown in broken lines) further as shown in, this filter operation can comprise further to be determined.That is,, shown in sub-step 511, web server 104 can determine that whether information is relevant to friend, new friend, particular message, news or unexpected event.If relevant, at sub-step 513 place, to this information assignment low-level state.Yet, if information does not fall in of those groups, this filter process advances to sub-step 515, at these sub-step 515 places, web server determines whether this information is upgraded relevant to state.If relevant, at sub-step 517 places to this information assignment high level state.In current exemplary embodiment, if be confirmed as upgrading uncorrelatedly with state in sub-step 515 place's information, this process turns back to sub-step 513 again.The user will recognize, web server 104 can determine whether this information is that state upgrades, and if be that state upgrades, by this information processing, be high level or high priority, and upgrade if not state, this information is used as to low-level or low priority.Can also be high priority by the information processing of other types, but the expectation restriction cause the number to the message of communicator increase activity.
Once complete filtration sub-step 514, this process just advances to sub-step 516 so, wherein, web server 104 (fore-end 308 of web server specifically) is determined one or more differences that may exist between the information obtained from CPW 106 at step S406 place and the previous information more early received from same CPW.In the present embodiment, only such different information is finally delivered to mobile device 102 to passback.As has been described, the sub-step that by Fig. 5 meaned corresponding with the step 408 of Fig. 4 finishes at sub-step 518 places.Will be appreciated that, step 516 can advantageously occur between step 504 and 506 in rear end part 306, in this case, if the CPW information in the previous content pulled for certain subscriber exists, change, only this information is further processed in web server 104.This will discharge server resource, with the user that continues as device 102 or pull information with other users of intermediary's web server and CPW from CPW.
Return to Fig. 4, once complete step 408, web server 104 just considers that one or more parts of handled information have high importance and still do not have high importance (for example, have low importance and maybe may have medium importance or certain other level of significance).If determined that handled information has high importance, at step 412 place, the fore-end 308 of web server 104 sends the information of the processing of high importance to mobile device 102 via the propelling movement channel of setting up on communication link 105.This occurs immediately when web server is determined, this is can be by carrying out with the propelling movement channel.If determined that at step 410 place handled information does not have high importance, can more postpone the transmission of handled information before reasonable time at another always, and reduce thus the communication activity between device and server, and therefore reduce the running down of battery on device.Therefore, at step 414 place, web server 104 waits for that reasonable time sends handled information to mobile device 102.Then, once reasonable time occur, at step 416 place, web server 104 is to mobile device 102 transmission information.
The appropriate time that web server 104 sends the low handled information of importance to mobile device 102 can be based on various considerations.For example, in certain embodiments, such appropriate time only periodically occurs, in this time, locates, and mobile device 102 carries out poll for information to web server 104.Such poll generally includes: from mobile device 102 to web server, 104 repeat to send request signal.In other cases, reasonable time occurs when particular case occurs.For example, when mobile device 102 is asked, if exist in addition now web server 104 to determine that the handled information of low importance of specific quantity has been stored for situation about being transmitted to mobile device, for the appropriate time that sends the low handled information of importance, occur.Although in superincumbent description, be described to relate to by web server 104 acquired informations and pulled, and mobile device is described to relate to poll from the low material information of web server acquisition, but be to be understood that, according to embodiment, any one in web server and mobile device can use respectively pull or polling operation (with periodically or asynchronous communication) come respectively from CPW and web server acquired information.In addition, it is contemplated that, when mobile device 102 is not connected to system 100 and will preserves information until mobile device while reconnecting as its results server, while perhaps when having spent time enough, making server delete information, server can pull information from content supplier website 106.
No matter whether respectively high importance or low material information are sent to mobile device 102 in step 412 and 416 places, once complete these steps, web server 104 is just carried out mutual a series of other steps in execution and mobile device, CPW or other mobile device/CPW.More specifically, in this, once complete step 412 and 416, at step 418-428 place, come the information of self-moving device 102 just can be uploaded to web server 104, and further be provided for CPW 106.As shown in Figure 4, at step 418 place, so alternately can be by web server 104 from mobile device 102 reception identification informations come.For example, if received such identification information at step 402 place, the reception of such identification information do not needed to occur always.Then, at step 420 place, web server 104 receives content information extraly from mobile device 102.Content information can comprise, for example, such as the file of image file or text or the user of mobile device, wishes to upload to for example, other data at the user profiles (, " wall ") of CPW place existence.
Next, at step 422 place, web server 104 receives order from mobile device 102, and this order indication web server uploads to CPW 106 by content information.In alternate embodiment, because in such embodiments, all the elements information that the web server supposition is provided by mobile device should further be uploaded to mobile device any CPW associated therewith, so do not need mobile device 102 to provide clearly this order to web server 104.And, then at step 424 place, web server 104 sends to CPW 106 identification information received from mobile device 102, so that the relation of authentication between web server and CPW.In response to sending this identification information, usually when meeting, authentication receives back token from CPW, shown in step 426.With respect to step 418, in all embodiment, now do not need to perform step clearly 424 and 426, particularly when such action during as the foundation of communication link in step 402,404 a part of.No matter when authentication occurs, verification process all allows web server 104 to represent mobile device 102 or carries out alternately with CPW 106 as the agency of mobile device 102 is next.Suppose that suitable authentication occurs, at step 428 place, web server 104 sends content information to CPW 106.
It is contemplated that, for the particular user account on the content supplier website, for server to uploading from content supplier website 106 with the needed user ID of downloading contents and password, being loaded into web server 104 to server and when web server is set up the content supplier website by the user at mobile device 102 First Contact Connections.Web server is stored in user ID and password in memory, and, as long as the user does not change user ID and password, whether web server is just used them to visit CPW, no matter connect and all keep being connected with the permanent of CPW with mobile device 102.Can further imagine, if mobile device does not reach predetermined amount of time from web server 104 solicited messages, if perhaps for the user's set queue that content downloaded to device, surpass age threshold value (age threshold) and/or memory capacity threshold value, can reduce on frequency or suspend fully from CPW 106 and pull information.
Except aforesaid upload process, in some cases, the user of operating moving device 102 expectation uploads to a plurality of CPW 106 by content.Web server 104 can promote such process, as shown in the step 430-438 of Fig. 4, particularly in the situation that mobile device 102 has been provided to web server by content information.More specifically, as show, at step 430 place, web server 104 determines whether web server receives the indication web server from mobile device 102 other orders of content information are provided to another CPW.If received such order, at following step 432 places, web server 104 determines whether with another CPW, to have set up communication link.If also do not set up such communication link, this process advances to step 434, wherein, receives other identification information from mobile device 102, and subsequently, at step 436 place, between web server 104 and another CPW 106, sets up communication link.; if also determined at step 432 place and with another CPW, do not set up communication link; in order to set up such communication link; must be again from mobile device 102 to web server, 104 provide identification information; permission authenticates web server with respect to this another CPW; for example, so that make this web server be operated (, with substantially the same operation) above-mentioned about step 424-426 as the agency of mobile device with respect to this another CWP.
Once place sets up communication link in step 436, if or determined and set up communication link with another CPW at step 432 place, this process advances to step 438, at step 438 place, content information is uploaded to another CPW.Therefore, by step 430-438, the content information that has been provided to a CPW in step 428 is provided to another CPW in addition.Although should be appreciated that Fig. 4 is not illustrated in the direct circulation in repeating of step 418-438, a plurality of parts and a plurality of other CPW about information, can repeatedly repeat this step.It is contemplated that, will provide content from mobile device 102 with unified form, and each formatted data independently and suitably in the server back end target CPW that will be uploaded to for content.
Also with reference to figure 4, once completed step 438, if or web server 104 determined and do not received order at step 430 place, whether definite mobile device 102 that web server is carried out step 440 place in addition disconnects from web server.Even mobile device 102 disconnects from web server 104, as general rule, web server still keeps the communication link of itself and CPW 106, the previous participation of web server is communicated by letter with this CPW's 106, and with respect to this CPW 106, the agency of the mobile device that web server can disconnect as representative, as shown in step 442.Therefore, even the mobile device 102 of web server representative does not temporarily communicate, web server 104 also can continue to be operated relatively with CPW 106 on ongoing basis.Therefore, web server 104 can continue operation from each CPW 106, to pull information, and can access and monitor such information along with the time, make when the mobile device before disconnected reconnects to web server, web server immediately (in due course) make the CPW Information Availability of up-to-date renewal.
Although top description is arranged, although and not shown in Fig. 4, in certain embodiments, mobile device 102 also can transmit and stop representing the instruction of itself for one or more CPW 106web servers to web server 104, in this case, web server will so be carried out.Finally, also as shown in Figure 4, if when completing steps 442 or determined that at step 440 place mobile device 102 still connects, web server 104 continue to determine whether to need or expectation and mobile device 102 and/or CPW 106 in some otherly set up other communication link.According to current flow chart, if there is no such needs or expectation, this process finishes at step 446 place, and if have such needs or expectation, this process turns back to and starts step 400.
Be to be understood that, although concrete steps are as shown in Figure 4 arranged, but web server 104 can be carried out multiple other or different step according to embodiment, and can rearrange according to embodiment, repeat or whole eliminate one or more in the particular step shown in Fig. 4.And, when carrying out other steps, can carry out or continuous basis on some in the step that repeats to carry out according to the flow chart of Fig. 4.For example, even when carry out such as by from mobile device to web server and then to one or more uploading content information of CPW, relevant step 418-438 means other when mutual, also can carry out or continuous basis on repeat with obtain and process the information that receives from CPW 106 and immediately (or basically immediately) to the high material information of mobile device 102 transmission relevant step 406-412.And, although Fig. 4 has described web server 104 continuously with some details or side by side with a plurality of CPW 106 communicate may, and illustrate exemplary mutual that web server promotes between given mobile device and such a or a plurality of CPW, but be to be understood that, between similar mutual other mobile devices at any number of permission and such a or a plurality of CPW, aspect generation, web server can or be carried out identical process basically simultaneously simultaneously.
It is contemplated that, rear end part can comprise the independent plug-in unit for each CPW 106, and this plug-in unit comprises the corresponding API that is applicable to its corresponding CPW.Each in plug-in unit comprises the API for its corresponding CPW, and by this API, plug-in unit pulls information from website, and this information is reformatted as to the general format of mobile device 102 clients.In addition, the content of self-moving device is reformatted as from the consolidation form of mobile device 102 client-side program the specified appropriate format of CPW be associated by the plug-in unit with when rear end part is uploaded in the future.In this mode, can in thering is the single message of consolidation form, send the content from user's device, and this content will be selected according to the user carries out route like that, and by being formatd for usining each each of rear end part plug-in unit of its each CPW as target.
Turn to Fig. 6, provide to illustrate and carried out another flow chart mutual and illustrative steps of the operation alternately can be mutual with one or more CPW time the by this when mobile device 102 and web server.That is, Fig. 6 is intended to the illustrative steps of diagram operation of the mobile device 102 of performed a plurality of steps complementary (or most of complementary) to illustrated web server 104 in superincumbent Fig. 4 and Fig. 5.In addition, as further described below, Fig. 6 also comprises the steps: by this step, mobile device 102 can in the situation that the intervention that there is no a web server 104 directly with CPW 106 in one or more carry out mutual, or mobile device 102 can with one or more the carrying out alternately in (but being independent of this interventions) while together with the intervention of web server and CPW 106.As shown in Figure 6, once start to operate at beginning step 600 place, mobile device 102 starts mutual with web server 104 by following manner: set up the communication link with web server at step 602 place, and sets up by web server thus and the communication link of CPW.
With reference to figure 7, step 602 can be understood to include illustrated some sub-steps in this accompanying drawing in addition.As show, once start at sub-step 700 places, mobile device 102 just activates the propelling movement channel application of supporting on mobile device, shown in sub-step 702.Then, at sub-step 704 places, mobile device 102 provides identification information to web server 104.Such identification information can comprise, for example, specify the authentication code (for example, sequence number, model or product Ref. No.) of concrete fast mobile terminal device, the information relevant to the user's who utilizes mobile device identity or such as other coded messages of login or password code.Next, at sub-step 706 places, at mobile device 102 places, determine whether expectation in via web server and CPW106 concrete one set up communication link.If now there is no such expectation, the represented process of Fig. 7 finishes at sub-step 708 places.Alternatively, if expectation is set up communication link via web server 104 with CPW 106, as provided the order of the expectation indicating to indicate to mobile device 102 by the user,, at sub-step 710 places, mobile device 102 additionally sends to web server the order that the indication web server is set up such communication link.
And, at sub-step 712 places, mobile device 102 additionally sends other web identification information to web server 104, allows web server and CPW 106 to set up communication link, and the permission web server is used as the agency of mobile device in the communicating by letter of mobile device 102 and this CPW.In certain embodiments, what the identification information sent at sub-step 712 places can be with sub-step 704 is identical, in this case, does not need to carry out sub-step 712.Once 712 places provide identification information in sub-step, at sub-step 714 places, just set up between mobile device and web server and push channel link.Once complete step 714 sub-, just can carry out all the other steps (as shown in piece " turns back to A ") of the process meaned by Fig. 6 after step 602.
Return to Fig. 6, once set up communication link at step 602 place and web server 104, mobile device 102 just for example, receives high material information via pushing channel (the propelling movement channel of, setting up at sub-step 714 places) from web server at step 604 place.In the present embodiment, in asynchronous mode, at mobile device, there is no definite time, this information of describing with reference to figure 4-5 is provided to mobile device 102 from web server 104.Except receiving on asynchronous basis so high material information, as step 606 subsequently further means, mobile device 102 can be in addition to web server 104 transmissions about being downloaded to by web server one or more inquiries of other information of mobile device.As discussed above in reference to Figure 5, although high material information can comprise the information such as state updating information, but other information (for example, low material information) can comprise the information such as contact/friend information, new friend's information, contacts list, photo or video, particular message, news or unexpected event information.
The inquiry provided at step 606 place by mobile device 102 can or be provided at the other times definite by mobile device on periodic basis.Although it is contemplated that in the present embodiment that mobile device 102 will determine when carries out the information except high material information is inquired about and then determined whether from web server to mobile device to transmit to web server 104, in other embodiments, such inquiry and/or the download of information can be in the determined times of mutual agreement by between web server and mobile device, only by web server, separately definite time is (for example, when web server has been determined while having collected the low material information of q.s) or another entity of the manufacturer by such as two devices having been programmed or aspect determined time and occurring.No matter the inquiry that whether comes the prompting web server 104 of self-moving device 102 to send a message back to mobile device or no be other triggerings of the transmission of the such information of prompting, shown in step 608, last other such information are also received from web server by mobile device.Thinking that step 602 is during to the step 402 of Fig. 4 supplementary, can think that step 604-608 is supplementing of web server operation that the step 406-412 by Fig. 4 (and particularly step 414-412) is meaned.
Still with reference to figure 6, at step 609 place subsequently, the information received from web server 104 by mobile device 102 is shown by mobile device or otherwise output.The degree that the demonstration of such information/output occurs depends on embodiment.In at least some embodiment, information is shown/is exported in standardized mode by mobile device 102, makes the specific formatted message of CPW or feature not be provided as the part of the information of show/output.More specifically, at some in such embodiment, the web server specific formatted message of 104 edit and proof CPW and feature, or in some alternate embodiments, the two the combination of mobile device or web server and mobile device comes the specific formatted message of edit and proof CPW and feature.
In carrying out such edit and proof, the information of the similar type found at different CPW, for example, even (quoted in a different manner by different CPW, as the information found at distribution site or alternatively as the information found on the wall), also be identified as thering is similar type conceptive, and the identification based on such, no matter the source of information how, can show (or output) such information in common mode on mobile device.; given so specific formatted message of CPW or the edit and proof of feature; even the information from the same concept type of different CPW is differently formatd at different CPW places; no matter the source of this information how; also still on mobile device, be shown as same or similar consistent mode, therefore promoted user's checking such information.Should also be noted that, such information not only can comprise text or view data, but also can comprise multiple other data, comprise the data that allow to show interactive window and data input area on mobile device, the user can be to other information or the order of input in this interactive window and data input area, and then the information that this is other or order can be sent back to web server.
Next, at step 610 place, mobile device 102 determines whether to need or expectation will upload to web server and/or finally upload to CPW 106 by current available content information at the mobile device place.For example whether the movement-based device has received the information of particular type from user or other sources to mobile device 102 or time of particular event whether having occurred or having pass by trigger such event of uploading is automatically determined these needs or expectation.Frequently, such needs/expectation will occur in response to the user command that mobile device 102 is provided.If determined at step 610 place and there is no such needs/expectation, as shown, this process advances to step 622 as described below.Yet, if determined at step 610 place and had such needs/expectation, at step 612 place, mobile device 102 sends content information to web server 104, and, at step 614 place, mobile device sends to web server the order that content information is uploaded to CPW 106 in addition.Except the identification information that is provided for authentication purpose from mobile device 102 of discussing in refer step 418 can be understood in the situation that the step 602 shown in Fig. 6 is provided (alternatively, the additional identification information that is applicable to this purpose can just be provided before step 612), step 610-614 can be understood to normally supplementing the step 418-428 of Fig. 4.
Once complete step 614, mobile device 102 further determines whether to exist needs to the one or more other CPW uploading content information a CPW who has been uploaded to except information/expectation at step 616 place.Again, can determine these needs or expectation based on many factors, this many factors comprises one or more instructions that the user by mobile device provides to mobile device etc.If determined and do not had such needs or expectation at step 616 place, this process advances to following step 622 again.Yet, if determined and had such needs or expectation at step 616 place, this process advances to step 618, wherein, via web server, between mobile device and such other CPW, set up other communication link.Step 618 can be considered to supplementing the step 432-436 of Fig. 4, and according to embodiment, step 618 can comprise following sub-step: wherein mobile device determines whether to have existed the communication link with so other CPW for the first time, and if determined and do not had such communication link, to web server, send other identification information, set up such communication link with the other CPW with such, and allow web server to be used as the agency of mobile device in such communication.
Once set up the other communication link with other CPW 106 at step 618 place, mobile device 102 just further sends for content information being uploaded to the order of this other CPW 106 to web server 104 at step 620 place so.It is corresponding with the step 430 of Fig. 4 that the execution of step 620 can be understood to, should further understand, and step 618 and 620 execution sequence are reversible, makes those steps corresponding with the order of the step 430-436 of Fig. 4 more closely.With reference to figure 6, once complete step 620, suppose that web server 104 in fact just uploads to content information other CPW in addition.Although not shown, in certain embodiments, once complete such uploading, web server 104 just sends it back and confirms such index signal occurred of uploading to mobile device 102.
Although the above-mentioned steps of Fig. 6 and the step of Fig. 4 imagination are used web server 104 as the intermediary between mobile device 102 and CPW 106, but web server does not need always to get involved such communication, but in some cases, one or more directly (that is, by not comprising any web server or at least not comprising one or more direct network ground connection of web server as above) in mobile device and CPW carry out mutual.In this, once completed step 620 (or, in some cases, step 610 as above and 616), mobile device 102 just further determines whether at step 622 place need to or to expect mobile device directly and one or more the communicating in CPW 106.
If it is not this situation that mobile device 102 is determined at step 622 place, mobile device can turn back to node A in its operation, and in response to this, this process starts and proceeds at step 604 place again.Suppose that this situation occurs, mobile device 102 thereby continuation operate, the ongoing basis repeating, content information is uploaded to web server from web server 104 reception information and continuation so.Yet, if determine that at step 622 place mobile device 102 needs or expectation and CPW 106 directly communicate, mobile device advances to step 624, at step 624 place, mobile device is set up such DCL.
Can determine whether that needs or expectation and CPW 106 directly communicate based on multiple consideration.In some cases, mobile device 102 is automatically determined this, and as a result of, is automatically set up the DCL with CPW 106.For example, if user's request is about the more information of specific exercise question, and by the direct communication with CPW, come best (for example, on the efficiency transmitted in data etc.) to complete the download to this information from given CPW, mobile device can attempt to be directly connected to this CPW.And, in some cases, the user may wish that the specific format to be associated with this CPW checks the information available at specific CPW place, and does not wish to check if this information is being provided by web server 104 by the edit and proof view of such information that may provide in leading to the way of mobile device.And, can determine whether that needs or expectation and CPW 106 directly communicate based on receiving the user command of clearly asking such communication.
According to embodiment, to set up DCL at step 624 place and can comprise multiple particular command or the operation of being undertaken by mobile device, this multiple particular command or operation can comprise from the user and receive input in some cases.For example, in one case, the user initiates the foundation to such DCL by following manner: make browser application/program open and move on mobile device, and will be input to the input area provided by browser for the URL (resource locator) of CPW, as a result of, the browser participation is communicated by letter with CPW's, and CPW and then return to web page or other information to browser, mobile device (with the user) can carry out communicating by letter with the further of CPW thus.In other embodiments, the foundation of DCL is the automated procedure that does not comprise any specific user action.
Anyway set up DCL, once set up this link, so, mobile device 102 just in the situation that another step 626 place to and/or from CPW 106, directly send and/or the reception information intervention of web server as above (and do not have).Subsequently, at step 628 place, mobile device further determines whether to need or expectation stops the existing communication link with web server 104.If there is no such needs/expectation, this process turns back to node A, and repeating step 604 and follow-up step again.That is, the direct communication between mobile device and CPW (situation that does not have web server to get involved) and indirect communication (passing through web server) can continue simultaneously.Yet, if determined at step 628 place and need to or expect to stop the communication based on server, this process advances to step 630, at this step 630 place, interrupts the communication (this and corresponding with reference to figure 4 step 440 as above) of mobile device and web server.
In the present embodiment, as mentioned above, web server 104 is configured to, even with after communicating by letter of mobile device is terminated, also keep itself and the communicating by letter of CPW or website, web server 104 had before represented that mobile device and this CPW or website communicated, and web server continues to serve as the agency of mobile device.Yet in other embodiments, when mobile device stops it with the communicating by letter of web server, web server is interrupted with communicating by letter of CPW.Under any circumstance, after step 630, at step 632 place, may exist for mobile device and re-establish new needs or the expectation of communicating by letter with web server.As determined whether at step 622 place to participate in the direct communication of CPW 106 or determining whether at step 628 place to stop and the communicating by letter of web server 104, at step 632 place, can determine whether to need or expectation mobile device 102 re-establishes and the communicating by letter of web server 104 based on any one in multiple consideration, this multiple consideration comprises, for example, trigger the user command, battery electric power consideration etc. of such behavior.If determined and should re-establish the communication based on server at step 632 place, this process turns back to and starts step 600.If do not determine, the represented process of Fig. 6 finishes at ending step 634 places.
Turn back to respectively Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, in a further embodiment, what the operation of being carried out by web server 104 and mobile device 102 may be with shown in Fig. 4-7 is different to a certain extent.More specifically, in some other embodiment, do not carry out the step 408-416 between the Node B shown in Fig. 4 and node C, web server 104 is alternatively operated with the different modes that is included in the step 800-814 shown in Fig. 8.As show, once proceed from Node B, do not carry out treatment step 408 (and in the corresponding step shown in Fig. 5), web server 104 alternatively performs step 800,802 and 804.Particularly, at step 800 place, web server 104 determined between the information that just from CPW 106, has obtained/pulled at step 406 place and the information before received from CPW for a long time whether occur changing.If place detects change in step 802, at step 804 place, the fore-end 308 of web server 104 is placed in this change information to change list.As a plurality of CPW that contact with respect to web server 104, while repeating these steps, the detected change information relevant to each CWP can be placed in and change list, and this change list is called as public change list in this case.
Next, at step 806 place, the fore-end 308 of web server 104 determines that handled information has high importance and still do not have high importance (for example, low importance).In execution should be determined, can consider the aforesaid identical consideration relevant with the step 410 of Fig. 4, and for this reason, step 806 also is noted as step 410 in Fig. 8.Be confirmed as having still low importance of high importance according to handled information, then this process advances to respectively step 808 or step 810.In step 808, determined that when handled information (for example has high importance, information relates to state and upgrades) time, the fore-end 308 of web server 104 sends to mobile device 102 notice that indication has occurred that high importance changes via pushing channel.Equally, at step 810 place, when having determined that handled information has low importance, the fore-end 308 of web server 104 also sends to mobile device 102 notice that indication has occurred that low importance changes via pushing channel.
Once sent notice in any one of step 808 or step 810, the fore-end 308 of web server 104 just can at step 812 place, receive after a while from the transmission of mobile device 102 change the request of information itself.This request can be received in any time definite by mobile device 102.Usually, if change information is to have high importance, mobile device 102 will send the request for information immediately or after step 808 place receives notice very soon.On the contrary, if change information has low importance, mobile device for example, will be waited for usually between the scheduled time that obtains such request (, periodicity or aperiodicity poll time) always.For example, device can wait for that being no more than 5 minutes asks high material information, and waits for and within 15-30 minute, download low material information between request.Under any circumstance, when at step 812 place, from mobile device 102, receiving the request for the transmission that changes information, the fore-end 308 of web server 104 sends the change information of asking with rear to mobile device 102 so.In this example, preferably, this change information does not send by pushing channel, perhaps alternatively, only high importance changes information exchange and crosses the propelling movement channel and send, and to reduce, mobile device is powered up to receive the time quantum that changes content, but will be appreciated that, in other embodiments, can send changed information via pushing channel.Once send this information at step 814 place, if perhaps at step 812 place, do not receive (or at least not receiving within a predetermined period of time) if the change the information received from CPW 106 do not detected for the request of information or at step 802 place, this process turns back to the node C (and thereby turn back to step 418) of Fig. 4.Will be appreciated that, if do not require content is uploaded to the content supplier website, server will turn back to step 406, because it will continue to pull content from content supplier website 106, and whether to be uploaded to mobile device 102 clients irrelevant with content.
Although in this example, no matter change information has the low importance of high importance, all by pushing channel, provide in an identical manner the notice of change information in step 808 and step 812 place, always but do not need like this.In other embodiments, for example, can send the notice changed about high importance quickly or in certain different other modes of notifying from changing low importance change than the notice changed about low importance.And, although in this example of Fig. 8, at step 814 place, send change information from send and notify the different time to occur at step 808,810 places, always do not need like this.For example, in another embodiment, the content that changes information in high importance is very little (for example, be less than the text message of 100 characters) situation under, together with the notice that this content can change with high importance, be provided (or, the notice that this content even can change as high importance).From top description, should it is evident that, at least some embodiment, the operation of rear end part can be aspect the respective communication of different piece and CPW 106 and mobile device 102, most of or be totally independent of the operation of fore-end.According to this embodiment, for example comprise pull or poll or periodically or the communication of the number of different types of asynchronous communication can be assigned to use by any one end, and the operation divided with another end is irrelevant.Therefore, rear end can be independent of the operation that fore-end carries out and continue from CPW to pull content, and forward end is divided to send and changed.In any specific time, fore-end can be pushed mobile device similarly, and perhaps makes server and mobile device carry out synchronous request in the change that waits for downloads, and does not consider the operation that carry out rear end.
About Fig. 9, the flow chart wherein provided shows in some other embodiment, does not carry out the step 604-609 between the node A shown in Fig. 6 and node D, and how mobile device 102 is alternatively operated with the different modes that comprises step 900-914.At the step 900-914 carried out by mobile device 102 shown in Fig. 9, be specifically supplementing the step 800-814 carried out by web server 104 shown in Fig. 8.As shown in Figure 9, when proceeding from node A, the receiving step 604 of execution graph 6 not, mobile device 102 alternatively can receive (one or two transmission step 808,801) following notices from web server 104: one or more changes detected recently or the information provided from CPW 106 in the time early.If place receives notice in step 900, at step 902 place, mobile device 102 determines that this this change of notice indication has still low importance of high importance.
If determined that at step 902 place this change has high importance, mobile device 102 determines whether that at step 904 place should obtain immediately high importance from web server 104 changes information.Change information although always should obtain as far as possible soon in certain embodiments high importance, but in other embodiments, mobile device can be still because a variety of causes determines that preferably postponement is attempted to obtain this information (for example,, because mobile device has low electric power) from web server.Suppose at step 904 place mobile device 102 and determined the information that should acquire change immediately, this process advances to step 906, at step 906 place, mobile device sends request immediately and provides high importance to change the request signal of information to mobile device to web server immediately.As response, at step 908 place, mobile device 102 finally receives the change information (or according to determined at least some these information of web server 104) of asking from web server.In this, the execution of step 908 is supplemented the execution of the step 814 of Fig. 8.
If alternatively mobile device has determined that at step 902 place notice indication change information has low importance, if perhaps do not determined at step 904 place should (or needs) information that acquires change immediately for mobile device, this process alternatively advances to step 910.At step 910 place, mobile device 102 further determines whether the appropriate time that web server 104 is carried out to poll for change information occurs.Such appropriate time can be the time periodically occurred, perhaps in other embodiments, can be mobile device 102 based on multiple other considerations (for example, start to have spent the predetermined time amount from another event, or received the user command of indication mobile device from web server 104 acquisition content informations) determine.
If the appropriate time at step 910 place for the poll web server does not also occur, this process can repeat this step, until (or may be advanced to another step of this process and/or may turn back to step 910 in the different time) appears in such time.Yet, if occur at step 910 place appropriate time, this process advances to step 912, at step 912 place, mobile device 102 sends poll/request signal to web server 104.After having sent this signal, this process turns back to step 908, and at this, mobile device 102 receives the change information of request.And as shown in Figure 9, after having completed step 908, mobile device 102 continues execution step 913, wherein, the information received is shown by mobile device 102 or otherwise output, with the user who allows mobile device, consults this information.As show, step 913 can be identical with the step 609 of Fig. 6 or similar.
Although the user of mobile device 102 has very big interest for the change information sent at step 908 place by web server 104 usually, this change information often is not included in to be processed before this information original in the CPW 106 obtainable plurality of kinds of contents in place (and format) information by web server.; even the information that web server 104 provides can comprise such as event, recently state information, from other people the various contents of comment etc.; for example, even and the part that mobile device 102 also can be shown as specific criteria information its user interface certainly (; the CPW that user's name, user contact etc.), still may cause due to the intervention of web server 104 can not comprising a large amount of contents and/or other information.For this reason, when after step 913 place shows change information, the user may determine to expect the information that not only acquires change, and also obtains other guide (or even format) information.If the user may wish to obtain other such information, mobile device further determines whether at step 914 place subsequently to have received for obtaining the user command of other information that do not receive from web server 104 at step 908 place.For example, when the user selects the shown icon of mobile device, the part that this icon may be made at step 913 place change information is shown, can receive such order.
If determined and received such order at step 914 place, mobile device 102 is set up DCL at step 916 place and CPW 106.This operation of setting up DCL can be identical with the operation that the step 614 of the above is associated or similar, and (for example can comprise the client-server communication based on web of standard, comprise the input of URL(uniform resource locator) (URL)/transmission and/or with the docking of the web page of CPW 106), the client-server communication based on web of this standard is designed to set up communication link and draws other information that the user expects.Therefore, when after step 916 place has set up DCL, then at step 918 place, receive other information of user's expectation from CPW 106.In the situation that completed after step 918 and do not received user command at step 914 place or in the situation that step 900 place receives the notice from web server 104 having determined, this process turns back to node D so, and continues the step 610 of Fig. 6.
In another alternate embodiment of the present invention, rear end part 306 comprises a plurality of plug-in units and processor, its each with corresponding CPW 106, be associated.Each plug-in unit comprises the API (API) of the content supplier website 106 associated for it.Each plug-in unit is used HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) (HTTP) for good and all to pull information from its corresponding content supplier website 106.
When rear end part 306 plug-in units detect change, change is loaded in queue, and fore-end 308 is to the device sending out notice.All plug-in units in rear end part 306 will continue queue is loaded to the information according to the enterprising row format of common form, comprise for example account ID, content type, priority and the information of the ID of information source (source contents provider website sign), user's set.For state, for example, form can be: type (state, mood, state and mood), action (removing state or more new state), provider, aggregated service account ID, exterior I D, friend have friend ID, state text, date issued and time while upgrading.Web server is set up the unification of each user's set (or user account) is presented by following manner: the content that will be pulled by all plug-in units merges in the public change list of each corresponding device (or user account).Set up content along with the time, and each input item can be coupled with timestamp.
Following algorithm can be for detection of the change during server sync, wherein server sync can be understood to include the synchronizeing of web server 104 and CPW 106 (by relatively, client synchronously can be understood to include such as the client of mobile device 102 and synchronizeing of web server).Web server 104 programs are preserved three numeral: cla, w1 and w2 for each account.Cla changes the list anchor, and w1 is the time started (sampling) that changes list window, and w2 is the concluding time (sampling) that changes list window.The part that server 104 storages fall in window [w1, w2] changes list.During server sync, find the institute change (that is, rear end is pulled from the content supplier website) be labeled the synchronous anchor identical with current w2 (that is, increasing progressively before 1 at w2).Once window size meets or exceeds minimum window size mw, this program halt server sync (web of content supplier size is synchronous).Once be suspended, server will be when receiving new clients poll the Resume service device synchronous.Its dependent variable is: ca is the client anchor; OFF is the sign of indication without synchronous behavior.Upgrade the value of cla, w1 and w2 according to following state transition rules:
When client is carried out poll for change, if client anchor ca drops in [w1, w2], Partial synchronization will carry out, and server sends it back the change (and deleting the change more Zao than ca) dropped in [ca, w2].When same EOS, will upgrade ca.If when client is carried out poll for change, the client anchor drops on outside [w1, w2], between web server 104 and the client-side program in mobile device 102, new Complete Synchronization will occur.
It is contemplated that, when window size reaches mw, can be for specific device 102 account suspension server sync (the rear end plug-in unit be that specific device 102 pulls content), in this case, the propelling movement of some loss (to the notice of device) may cause the service disruption for device when there is no clients poll.It is contemplated that, while advantageously at the w2 from last, coming into existence change co-pending, send and push, as long as, from the w1 change co-pending that comes into existence, just can send propelling movement.
Further it is contemplated that, intermediary described here web server 104 can advantageously be utilized the device poll manager of describing hereinafter: the title of submitting on May 21st, 2009 is the U.S. Provisional Application 61/180,301 of " AMOBILE COMPUTING DEVICE AND METHOD WITH ENHANCED POLING MANAGEMENT (mobile computing device and method with the management of enhancement mode poll) ".
As the example of uploading content, will describe now photo (also referred to as picture) and upload.Intermediary's web server 104 can be for by optimizing the process from user's set 102 to a plurality of social networking system 106 uploaded camera shots at intermediary server 104 memory 302 place's high-speed cache photos.Exemplary flow is as follows:
1. intermediary's web server front end 308 is located rear end part 306 indicating user devices 102 have been uploaded to photo in step 1002 (Figure 10);
2.web server front end or rear end are at step 1004 place, the photo new to this gives photo URL and at unique photo ID of system scope;
3. at step 1006 place, photo ID is downloaded to device 102, and in response to this, the device client-side program makes photo ID be associated with name of pictures;
4. at step 1008 place, rear end downloads files into the position such as/tmp/uniquephotoid.tmp by HTTP;
5. at step 1010 place, submit the work.uploadPhoto for each content supplier website 106 to each the corresponding rear end part be associated 306 plug-in unit in the object content provider website, to upload this photo files;
6. at step 1012 place, the rear end part forward end partly provides back the shared success of photo or failed report;
7. at step 1014 place, front end can be notified this success or failure to user's set 102 alternatively;
8. at step 1016 place, passing by after predetermined amount of time, to delete photo.
In operation, the fore-end 308 from user's set 102 to network is uploaded the photo from user's set 102, shown in step 1102 (Figure 11).In step 1206 (Figure 12), locate, fore-end 308 or rear end part 306 are cached at photo in intermediary's web server 104 and reach predetermined amount of time, to allow same photo to be submitted to the website of different system, and do not need user's set 102 again to upload this photo.After this predetermined amount of time, will wipe this photo.This predetermined amount of time can be any time section, and is selected according to memory limitations and frequency of utilization.This time period can be for example 24 hours, this time period can start when photo is uploaded to memory 302, thus, once picture is uploaded, this time period just is set, or this time period can be when uploading to content supplier 106 by photo, thus, when each picture is uploaded to new content supplier, will expand this time period.
For an exemplary embodiment, in step 1102 (Figure 11), locate, sign as action from mobile device 102 to intermediary server front end 308 uploaded camera shots and given content provider website 106, and it is stored in the temporary storing device of the webserver.In step 1004 (Figure 10), locate, front end 308 is forwarded to the plug-in unit in rear end 306 by photo, and this plug-in unit can for example be exclusively used in the content supplier website by the appointment of mobile device terminal.At step 1006 place, webserver fore-end 308 also sends it back to user's set 102 message that comprises the photo sign (ID) be associated with preserved photo.The indicating device of Huo Dui position, photo ID home position, this position is the position at web server memory 302 place's storage pictures.At step 1104 place, mobile device receives photo ID, and photo ID is associated (mapping) with the title of photo, as indicated in step 1106.Subsequently, in step 1108, if mobile device 102 is selected to send same photo to different social networking systems via user interface, mobile device sends photo ID rather than practical photograph to the webserver.As response, intermediary server 104 will be retrieved this photo, and it is forwarded to another plug-in unit that is exclusively used in another content supplier website 106, as at (Figure 12) as shown in step 1204.It is contemplated that, once remove photo from memory 302, just to user's set 102, send and upgrade, so that make user's set remove the associated of name of pictures and photo ID in step 1110, make device upload this photo.On the other hand, if photo no longer is stored, and server receives the request upload the photo be associated with photo ID, and fore-end sends error message to subscriber's device, in response to this, invites subscriber's device uploaded camera shots again.
For other embodiment, web server rear end part 306 determines that the photo uploaded from user's set 102 is whether in necessity restriction of target social networking system (that is, tolerance and big or small).It is contemplated that, this can be processed by the plug-in unit be associated with each content supplier website when from memory 302, removing picture, because each plug-in unit can be stored the content supplier's website restriction about photo.If meet this restriction, rear end 306 can send to photo the object content provider website.Otherwise, will adjust according to the requirement of content supplier website the size of photo.In order to adjust the big or small of photo and/or photo to be scaled to target sizes, adjust big or small coefficient and be determined.Can be as follows for determining the useful especially algorithm of adjusting big or small coefficient X:
x/100＝((t-f)/(kc))^(0.5)
Wherein
X adjusts big or small percentage
T be take the target sizes that byte is unit, and can be for example about 1 Mbytes or still less, and can advantageously be less than 200,000 bytes, and is 100,000 bytes in one implementation.
F is the little tolerance factor of file size
K is constant coefficient, and can be less than 1, and can advantageously be less than 0.5, and is selected as in one implementation 0.23.
C be take the size of the original document that byte is unit.
By storage picture in web server 104, server reduces power consumption in device and the bandwidth burden on communication network by following manner: when the local area network (LAN) communicated with it by this device or wide area network only carry out upload of media one time, allow mobile device to send this media in the different time to different social networking service devices.In addition, web server can make these media be applicable to the form of each content supplier website expectation, and this device does not need to know or adapts to these and requires successfully upload of media.
It is also conceivable that and can in step 1302 (Figure 13), via intermediary's web server 104, photo be downloaded to device 102.For example, for the RSS news feed, by the rear end news feed with news feed summary, pull the photo from the RSS content sources.When such news information to be detected be new in rear end in step 1,304 306, or in other words detect and pull from this rear end part from this CPW before previous RSS news feed while change having occurred, rear end part 306 forward end of server 104 partly are transmitted in step 1306 presenting for the client terminal device appropriate format.Fore-end 308 will generate the low priority sending out notice to client terminal device 102, and will be loaded summary and photo for installing 102 queue.When after this client terminal device divides the transmission polling request for the content forward end, at step 1308 place, front end comprises transmission the content of the queue of news feed, the photo that this queue comprises format and summary.Client-side program on mobile device 102 will show summary and the photo be associated on mobile device 102 displays 216.For example, if input unit 210 comprises the touch sensor (being commonly referred to touch-screen) on display, the user can touch the screen at summary and photo place, and user interface is directly connected to the content supplier website be associated with news feed summary/photo by link 110, and load the additional information about news feed on display 216, for being checked by the user.Therefore rear end part 306 detects and format new photo and summary for device, and fore-end 308 can obtain to the device content of announcement, and the polling request for news feed being downloaded to mobile device 102 from installing is responded.
Can further imagine, the storage of client-side program in mobile device 102 has server account's the content type of each content supplier website and some definition of characteristic about the user.At step 1502 place, the account that the user interface of device will be set up according to the user on server changes.For example, suppose that the user enters Facebook with its web server 104 accounts
tMand Twitter
tM.When user and user interface carry out alternately forming will upload to the message 1402 (Figure 14) of content supplier website the time, user-interface display provides for message the object content provider website be sent to the selection (not shown) of " Facebook ", " Twitter " or " all ".According to carried out selection, the parameter of message can be different (for example, the numbers of character) in step 1504.If the user selects all, length 1404 will be shorter in two content supplier websites restrictions.Can further imagine, length counting 1404 and warning 1406 can be provided.When at step 1506 place user input text, be presented at before reaching restriction the residue character allowed in character limit 1404.In certain threshold value such as 30 characters, will show warning 1406 in step 1514.When surpassing restriction, in step 1516, remaining character will enter negative counting, or will prevent that the user from inputting other characters.In the situation that the user changes destination content supplier source, restriction will suitably be changed.For example, if after creating message by Twitter
tMwebsite increases to destination, and restriction will reduce.If remove the Twitter as destination
tMwebsite, restriction increases.
