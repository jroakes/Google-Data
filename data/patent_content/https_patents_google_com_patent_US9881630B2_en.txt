- a specific type of acoustic noise that has become a particularly persistent problem, and which is addressed by the methods and systems of the present disclosure, is the impulsive noise caused by keystroke transients, especially when using the embedded keyboard of a laptop computer during teleconferencing applications (e.g., in order to make notes, write e-mails, etc.).
- this impulsive noise in the microphone signals can be a significant nuisance due to the spatial proximity between the microphones and the keyboard, and partly due to possible vibration effects and solid-borne sound conduction within the device casing.
- the present disclosure provides new and novel signal enhancement methods and systems specifically for semi-supervised acoustic keystroke transient cancellation.
- the following sections will clarify and analyze the signal processing problem in greater detail, and then focus on a specific class of approaches characterized by the use of broadband adaptive FIR filters.
- various aspects of the semi-supervised/semi-blind signal processing problem will be described in the context of a user device (e.g., a laptop computer) that includes an additional reference sensor underneath the keyboard.
- the semi-supervised/semi-blind signal processing problem can be regarded as a new class of adaptive filtering problems in the hands-free context in addition to the already more extensively studied classes of problems in this field.
- missing feature approaches Similar approaches are also known from image and video processing Similar to the speech enhancement methods mentioned above, the missing feature-type approaches typically require very accurate detections of the keystroke transients. Moreover, in the case of keystroke noise, this detection problem is exacerbated by both the reverberation effects and the fact that each keystroke actually leads to two audible clicks with unknown and varying distance, whereby the peak of the second click is often buried entirely in the overlapping speech signal (the first click occurs due to the actual keystroke and the second click occurs after releasing the key).
- the following describes some measured keystroke transient noise signals (e.g., using a user device configured with the internal microphones on top of its display) under different reverberant conditions and different typing speeds.
- Typing speeds are commonly measured in number of words per minute (wpm) where by definition one “word” consists of five characters. It should be understood that each character consists of two keystroke transients. Based on various studies of computer users of different skill level and purpose, 40 wpm has emerged as a general rule of thumb for the touch typing speed on a typical QWERTY keyboard of a laptop computer. As 40 wpm corresponds to 6.7 keystroke transients per second, the average distance between the keystrokes can sometimes be as low as 150 ms (milliseconds).
- the example signals shown in FIG. 2 confirm this approximation, where the measurement of plot (a) was performed in an anechoic environment (e.g., the cabin of a car).
- the methods and systems of the present disclosure are designed to overcome existing problems in transient noise suppression for audio streams in portable user devices (e.g., laptop computers, tablet computers, mobile telephones, smartphones, etc.).
- the methods and systems described herein may take into account some less-defective signal as side information on the transients (e.g., keystrokes) and also account for acoustic signal propagation, including the reverberation effects, using dynamic models.
- the methods and systems provided are designed to take advantage of a synchronous reference microphone embedded in the keyboard of the user device (which may sometimes be referred to herein as the “keybed” microphone), and utilize an adaptive filtering approach exploiting the knowledge of this keybed microphone signal.
- one or more microphones associated with a user device records voice signals that are corrupted with ambient noise and also with transient noise from, for example, keyboard and/or mouse clicks.
- the user device also includes a synchronous reference microphone embedded in the keyboard of the user device, which allows for measurement of the key click noise substantially unaffected by the voice signal and ambient noise.
- a synchronous reference microphone embedded in the keyboard of the user device, which allows for measurement of the key click noise substantially unaffected by the voice signal and ambient noise.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example 100 of such an application, where a user device 140 (e.g., laptop computer, tablet computer, etc.) includes one or more primary audio capture devices 110 (e.g., microphones), a user input device 165 (e.g., a keyboard, keypad, keybed, etc.), and an auxiliary (e.g., secondary or reference) audio capture device 115 .
- a user device 140 e.g., laptop computer, tablet computer, etc.
- primary audio capture devices 110 e.g., microphones
- a user input device 165 e.g., a keyboard, keypad, keybed, etc.
- auxiliary audio capture device 115 e.g., secondary or reference
- the one or more primary audio capture devices 110 may capture speech/source signals ( 150 ) generated by a user 120 (e.g., an audio source), as well as background noise ( 145 ) generated from one or more background sources of audio 130 .
- transient noise ( 155 ) generated by the user 120 operating the user input device 165 e.g., typing on a keyboard while participating in an audio/video communication session via user device 140
- the combination of speech/source signals ( 150 ), background noise ( 145 ), and transient noise ( 155 ) may be captured by audio capture devices 110 and input (e.g., received, obtained, etc.) as one or more input signals ( 160 ) to a signal processor 170 .
- the signal processor 170 may operate at the client, while in accordance with at least one other embodiment the signal processor may operate at a server in communication with the user device 140 over a network (e.g., the Internet).
- the auxiliary audio capture device 115 may be located internally to the user device 140 (e.g., on, beneath, beside, etc., the user input device 165 ) and may be configured to measure interaction with the user input device 165 . For example, in accordance with at least one embodiment, the auxiliary audio capture device 115 measures keystrokes generated from interaction with the keybed. The information obtained by the auxiliary microphone 115 may then be used to better restore a voice microphone signal which is corrupted by key clicks (e.g., input signal ( 160 ), which may be corrupted by transient noises ( 155 )) resulting from the interaction with the keybed. For example, the information obtained by the auxiliary microphone 115 may be input as a reference signal ( 180 ) to the signal processor 170 .
- key clicks e.g., input signal ( 160 )
- transient noises ( 155 ) transient noises
- the signal processor 170 may be configured to perform transient suppression/cancellation on the received input signal ( 160 ) (e.g., voice signal) using the reference signal ( 180 ) from the auxiliary audio capture device 115 .
- the transient suppression/cancellation performed by the signal processor 170 may be based on broadband adaptive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) filtering.
- MIMO broadband adaptive multiple input multiple output
- the methods and systems of the present disclosure have numerous real-world applications.
- the methods and systems may be implemented in computing devices (e.g., laptop computers, tablet computers, etc.) that have an auxiliary microphone located beneath the keyboard (or at some other location on the device besides where the one or more primary microphones are located) in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of transient noise suppression processing that may be performed.
- the methods and systems of the present disclosure may be used in mobile devices (e.g., mobile telephones, smartphones, personal digital assistants, (PDAs)) and in various systems designed to control devices by means of speech recognition.
- PDAs personal digital assistants
- Double-talk control (or double-talk detection in particular), as in conventional AEC is not straightforward in the situations addressed by the methods and systems described herein (mainly due to (iii) and (v)).
- FIG. 3 shows an example of the system considered as a generic 2 ⁇ 3 source separation problem.
- FIG. 3 shows an example system 300 with multiple input channels and multiple output channels
- FIGS. 4 and 6 illustrate more specific arrangements in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 4 shows an example system 400 that corresponds to a supervised adaptive filter structure
- FIG. 6 shows an example system 600 that corresponds to a slightly modified version of a semi-blind adaptive SIMO filter structure (more specifically, FIG. 6 illustrates a semi-blind adaptive SIMO filter structure with equalizing post-filter).
- paths represented by h ij denote acoustic propagation paths from the sound sources s i to the audio input devices x j (e.g., microphones).
- h ij e.g., h 11 , h 12 , h 21 , etc.
- x j e.g., microphones
- the linear contribution of these propagation paths h ij can be described by impulse responses h ij (n).
- blocks identified by w ji denote adaptive finite impulse response (FIR) filters with impulse responses w ji (n).
- FIR adaptive finite impulse response
- the FIR filters included in the example systems shown in FIGS. 3, 4, and 6 may be described by the following filter equation:
- latent variables The coefficients of the MIMO system (impulse responses in the linear case) are regarded as latent variables. These latent variables are assumed to have less variability over multiple time frames of the observed data. As they allow for a global optimization over longer data sequences, latent variable models have the well-known advantage of reducing the dimensions of data, making it easier to understand and, thus, in the present context, reduce or avoid distortions in the output signals. In the following, this approach may be referred to as “system-based” optimization in contrast to the “signal-based” approaches also described below. It should be noted that in practice it is often useful to combine signal-based and system-based approaches for signal enhancement, and thus an example of how to combine such approaches in the present context will be described in detail as well.
- the resulting supervised adaptation process based on this direct access to the interfering keyboard reference signals s 2 (n) without cross-talk from any other sources s 1 (n), as shown in FIG. 4 , is very simple and robust, and as this approach just subtracts the appropriately filtered keyboard reference, it does not introduce distortions to the desired speech signals.
- a closely related technique known as acoustic echo suppression (AES) has been shown to be particularly attractive for rapidly time varying systems.
- AES acoustic echo suppression
- One existing approach for low-complexity AES which inherently includes double-talk control and a distortion-less constraint, is an attractive candidate to fulfill the requirements (i), (ii), (iv), and (vi).
- requirement (iii) also makes the adaptation control significantly more difficult than in conventional AEC, as the reference signal (e.g., filter input) x 3 is no longer statistically independent from the speech signal S 1 (requirement (iv)). This contradicts the common assumptions in supervised adaptive filtering theory and the common strategies for double-talk detection.
- the relation between x 1 , x 2 is closer to linearity than the relation between x 3 , x 1 and the relation between x 3 , x 2 , respectively (see the example system shown in FIG. 3 ). This would motivate a blind spatial signal processing using the two array microphones x 1 , X 2 .
- x 3 still contains significantly less crosstalk and less reverberation due to the proximity between the keyboard and the keyboard microphone. Therefore, the keyboard microphone is best suited for guiding the adaptation.
- the overall system can be considered as a semi-blind system.
- the guidance of the adaptation using the keyboard microphone addresses both the double-talk problem and the resolution of the inherent permutation ambiguity concerning the desired source in the output of blind adaptive filtering methods.
- the asterisks (*) denote linear convolutions (analogous to the definition in equation (2)).
- the filter adaptation process simplifies to a form that resembles the well-known supervised adaptation approaches.
- this process performs blind system identification so that, ideally, w 11 (n) ⁇ h 22 (n) and w 21 (n) ⁇ h 21 (n).
- the desired signal s 1 (n) is also filtered by the same MISO FIR filters (which can be estimated during the activity of the keystrokes, for example, by the simplified cancellation process described in the previous section above), it is straightforward to add an additional equalization filter to the output signal y 1 to remove any remaining linear distortions.
- This single-channel equalizing filter will not change the signal extraction performance.
- the design of such a filter could be based on an approximate inversion of one of the filters in the example system 300 , for example, filter w 11 . Such an example design is also in line with the so-called minimum-distortion principle.
- the overall system can be further simplified by moving this inverse filter into the two paths w 11 and w 21 .
- This equivalent formulation results in a pure delay by D samples (instead of the adaptive filter w 11 ) and a single modified filter w′ 21 , respectively, as represented by the solid lines in the system shown in FIG. 6 (which will be described in greater detail below).
- w pq,l are the coefficients of the filter impulse response w pq .
- x p,k ( n ) [ x p ( n ⁇ Nk ), x p ( n ⁇ Nk ⁇ 1), . .
- T denotes transposition of a vector or a matrix.
- the block output signal of length N may now be defined. Based on equation (3), presented above,
- m is the block time index
- y qp ( m ) [ y qp ( mN ), . . . , y qp ( mN+N ⁇ 1)] T
- U p,k ( m ) [ x p,k ( mN ), . . . , x p,k ( mN+N ⁇ 1)].
- the block output signal (equation (8)) is transformed to its frequency-domain counterpart (e.g., using a discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrix).
- W N ⁇ 2N 01 [O N ⁇ N I N ⁇ N ]
- W 2N ⁇ N 10 [I N ⁇ N O N ⁇ N ] T
- W 2 ⁇ N ⁇ 2 ⁇ N 01 [ O N ⁇ N O N ⁇ N O N ⁇ N I N ⁇ N ]

- G 2L ⁇ 2L 10 diag ⁇ tilde over (G) ⁇ 2N ⁇ 2N 10 , .
- the output signal blocks (e.g., y 1 , y 2 in the example shown in FIG. 3 and described above) and/or the error signal blocks needed for the optimization criterion may be readily obtained by a superposition of these signal vectors.
- the implementation presented in Table 2 may be based on the block-by-block minimization of the error signal of equation (16) with respect to the frequency-domain coefficient vector w′ 21 .
- the following provides a suitable block-based optimization criterion in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure. As described above, this filter optimization should be performed during the exclusive activity of keystroke transients (and inactivity of speech or other signals in the acoustic environment). Once a suitable block-based optimization criterion is established, the following description will also provide details about the new fast-reacting transient noise detection system and method of the present disclosure, which is tailored to the semi-blind scenario according to FIG. 6 in reverberant environments.
- the methods and systems of the present disclosure additionally apply the concept of robust statistics within this frequency-domain framework the (semi-)blind scenario.
- Robust statistics is an efficient technique to make estimation processes inherently less sensitive to occasional outliers (e.g., short bursts that may be caused by rare but inevitable detection failures of adaptation controls).
- the robust adaptation methods and systems of the present disclosure consist of at least the following, each of which will be described in greater detail below:
- Modeling the noise with a super-Gaussian probability distribution function to obtain an outlier-robust technique corresponds to a non-quadratic optimization criterion.
- Block-based weighted least-squares criterion is generalized to a corresponding M-estimator:
- e(iN), . . . , e(iN+N ⁇ 1) denote the elements of the signal vector e(i) (according to the description above for the broadband block-online frequency-domain adaptation) with block index i.
- ⁇ ⁇ ( ⁇ z ⁇ ) ⁇ ⁇ z ⁇ 2 2 , for ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ z ⁇ ⁇ k 0 , k 0 ⁇ ⁇ z ⁇ - k 0 2 2 , for ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ z ⁇ ⁇ k 0 , ( 19 )
- k 0 >0 is a constant controlling the robustness of the process.
- the overall system 600 may include a foreground filter 620 (e.g., the main adaptive filter producing the enhanced output signal y 1 , as described above), as well as a separate background filter 640 (denoted by dashed lines) that may be used for controlling the adaptation of the foreground filter 620 .
- a foreground filter 620 e.g., the main adaptive filter producing the enhanced output signal y 1 , as described above
- a separate background filter 640 denoted by dashed lines
- x 3 (m) F 2N [O 1 ⁇ N , x 3 (mN ⁇ D), . . . (21d) . . . , x 3 (mN ⁇ D + N ⁇ 1)]
- S′(m) ⁇ S′(m ⁇ 1) + (1 ⁇ ⁇ )X 2 H (m)X 2 (m) (21e)
- K(m) S′ ⁇ 1 (m)X 2 H (m) (21f)

- w b (m) diag ⁇ F 2N W 2N ⁇ N 10 , . . .
- N ⁇ min ′(m) max ⁇ [ ⁇ , min 1 ⁇ n ⁇ N ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ′ ⁇ ( ⁇ [ e l ⁇ ( m ) ] n ⁇ s ⁇ ⁇ ( m ) ) ⁇ ] (21u)
- an important feature of the example implementation according to Table 2 in order to further speed up the convergence, are the additional offline iterations (denoted by index ) in each block.
- additional offline iterations denoted by index
- the method carries over directly to the supervised case. Indeed, in the case of supervised adaptive filtering, this approach is particularly efficient as the entire Kalman gain computation only depends on the sensor signal (meaning that the Kalman gain needs to be calculated only once per block).
- the total number l max of offline iterations may be subdivided into two steps, as described in the following:
- the method of using offline iterations is particularly efficient with the multi-delay (e.g., partitioned) filter model, which allows the decoupling of the filter length L and the block length N.
- multi-delay e.g., partitioned
- Such a model is attractive in the application of the present disclosure with highly nonstationary keystroke transients, as the multi-delay model further improves the tracking capability of the local signal statistics.
- the scaling factor s ⁇ is the other main ingredient of the method of robust statistics (see equation (18) above), and is a suitable estimate of the spread of the random errors.
- s ⁇ may be obtained from the residual error, which in turn depends on w .
- the scale factor should, for example, reflect the background noise level in the local acoustic environment, be robust to short error bursts during double-talk, and track long-term changes of the residual error due to changes in the acoustic mixing system (e.g., impulse responses h qp in the example system shown in FIG. 6 and described above), which may be caused by, for example, speaker movements.
- the considerations underlying the following description may be based on the semi-blind system structure of the present disclosure exploiting the keyboard reference microphone (e.g., of a portable computing device, such as, for example, a laptop computer) for keystroke transient detection, as described earlier sections above.
- the keyboard reference microphone e.g., of a portable computing device, such as, for example, a laptop computer
- keystroke transient detection as described earlier sections above.
- the keyboard reference microphone e.g., of a portable computing device, such as, for example, a laptop computer
- a reliable adaptation control is a more challenging task than the adaptation control problem for the well-known supervised adaptive filtering case (e.g., for acoustic echo cancellation).
- the present disclosure provides a novel adaptation control based on multiple decision criteria which also exploit the spatial selectivity by the multiple microphone channels.
- the resulting method may be regarded as a semi-blind generalization of a multi-delay-based detection mechanism.
- the criteria that may be integrated in the adaption control include, for example, power of the keyboard reference signal, nonlinearity effect, and approximate blind mixing system identification and source localization, each of which are further described below.
- the signal power ⁇ x 3 2 (m) of the keyboard reference signal according to equation (21i) typically gives a very reliable indication of the activity of keystrokes.
- the block length N is chosen to be shorter than the filter length L using the multi-delay filter model.
- the forgetting factor ⁇ b should be smaller than the forgetting factor ⁇ .
- the choice of the forgetting factor (between 0 and 1) essentially defines an effective window length for estimating the signal power. A smaller forgetting factor corresponds to a short window length and, hence, to a faster tracking of the (time-varying) signal statistics.
- this first criterion should be complemented by further criteria, which are described in detail below.
- the adaptation control of the present disclosure carries over this foreground-background structure to the blind/semi-blind case.
- the use of an adaptive filter in the background provides various opportunities for synergies among the computations of the different detection criteria.
- the detection variable ⁇ 1 describes the ratio of a linear approximation to the nonlinear contribution in x 3 .
- the detection variable ⁇ 2 is described by the detection variable ⁇ 2 .
- This criterion can be understood as a spatio-temporal source signal activity detector. It should be noted that both of the detection variables ⁇ 1 and ⁇ 2 are based on the adaptive background filter (similar to the foreground filter, but with slightly larger stepsize and smaller forgetting factor for quick reaction of the detection mechanism).

Abstract
Description
which is reproduced below as equation (2). The details of filter equation (2) are provided in a later section.
h 21(n)*w 11(n)=−h 22(n)*w 21(n) (1)
It should be noted that in equation (1) the asterisks (*) denote linear convolutions (analogous to the definition in equation (2)). For the case of only one active source signal (e.g., the MIMO de-mixing system reduces to a MISO system), the filter adaptation process simplifies to a form that resembles the well-known supervised adaptation approaches. Moreover, it can be shown that this process performs blind system identification so that, ideally, w11(n)∝h22(n) and w21(n)∝−h21(n). These ideal solutions follow from equation (1) as long as h22(n) and h21(n) do not share common zeros in the z-domain and the filter length is sufficiently long for the crosstalk cancellation.
where wpq,l are the coefficients of the filter impulse response wpq. By partitioning the impulse response wpq of length L into K segments of integer length N=L/K, equation (2) can be written as
where
x p,k(n)=[x p(n−Nk),x p(n−Nk−1), . . . , x p(n−Nk−N+1)]T, (4)
w pq,k =[w pq,Nk ,w pq,Nk+1 , . . . , w pq,Nk+N−1]T, (5)
x p(n)=[x p,0 T(n),x p,1 T(n), . . . , x p,K−1 T(n)]T. (6)
Superscript T denotes transposition of a vector or a matrix. The length-N vectors wpq,k, k=0, . . . , K−1 represent sub-filters of the partitioned tap-weight vector
w pq =[w pq,0 T , . . . , w pq,K−1 T]T. (7)
where m is the block time index, and
y qp(m)=[y qp(mN), . . . , y qp(mN+N−1)]T, (9)
U p,k(m)=[x p,k(mN), . . . , x p,k(mN+N−1)]. (10)
To derive the frequency-domain procedure, the block output signal (equation (8)) is transformed to its frequency-domain counterpart (e.g., using a discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrix). The matrices Up,k(m), k=0, . . . , K−1 are Toeplitz matrices of size (N×N). Since a Toeplitz matrix Up,k(m) can be transformed, by doubling its size, to a circulant matrix of size (2N×2/N), and a circulant matrix can be diagonalized using the (2N×2/N)-DFT matrix F2N with elements e−j2πvn/(2N) (v, n=0, . . . , 2N−1), this gives
U p,k T(m)=W N×2N 01 F 2N −1 X p,k(m)F 2N W 2N×N 10
with the diagonal matrices
X p,k(m)=diag{F 2N [x p(mN−Nk−N), . . . , x p(mN−Nk+N−1)]T} (11)
and the window matrices WN×2N 01 and W2N×N 10 as defined in Table 1, illustrated below.
TABLE 1 |
Definition of window matrices: |
WN×2N 01 = [ON×N IN×N] | |
W2N×N 10 = [IN×N ON×N]T | |
| |
G2N×2N 01 = F2NW2N×2N 01F2N −1 | |
| |
{tilde over (G)}2N×2N 10 = F2NW2N×2N 10F2N −1 | |
G2L×2L 10 = diag{{tilde over (G)}2N×2N 10, . . . , {tilde over (G)}2N×2N 10} | |
This finally leads to the following block output signal of the pq-th filter:
y qp(m)=W N×2N 01 F 2N −1 X p(m) w pq, (12)
where
X p(m)=[X p,0(m),X p,1(m), . . . , X p,K−1(m)], (13)
w pq =[w pq,0 T , . . . , w pq,K−1 T]T, (14)
w pq,k =F 2N W 2N×N 10 w pq,k. (15)
Based on the compact expressions of equation (12) for p=1, 2, 3, and q=1, 2, the output signal blocks (e.g., y1, y2 in the example shown in
e(m)=x 1(m)−W N×2N 01 F 2N −1 X 2(m) w′ 21, (16)
where x1(m) denotes a length-N block of the microphone signal x1(n), delayed by D samples. Similarly, the adaptation method of the original blind SIMO system identification-based approach described above can be expressed using an error signal vector in which the delayed reference signal x1(m) in equation (16) is replaced by another adaptive sub-filter term according to equation (12), that is
e AED(M)=W N×2N 01 F 2N −1 [X 1(m) w 11 +X 2(m) w 21]. (17)
-
- (1) robust adaptive filter estimation using a modified optimization criterion, and
- (2) adaptive (e.g., time varying) scale factor estimation.
where β(i, m) is a weighting function defining different classes of methods, e.g., β(i, m)=(1−λ)λm−i with the forgetting
gives the corresponding non-robust approach. In general, p(•) is a convex function and sρ is a real-valued positive scale factor for the i-th block (as further described below). One of the main statements of the theory on robust statistics is that the resulting process inherits robust properties as long as the nonlinear function p(•) has a bounded derivative. It can easily be verified that the condition of a bounded derivative is not fulfilled for the classical case p(•)=|•|2.
where k0>0 is a constant controlling the robustness of the process. The derivative of p (•) for the Huber estimator,
clearly fulfills the boundedness requirement and it may be shown that the choice in equation (19) gives the optimum equivariant robust estimator under the assumption of Gaussian background noise.
