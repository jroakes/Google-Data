Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to media captioning and, more particularly, to a technique of customizing mobile media captioning based on mobile media rendering.
- closed captioning subtitles are provided in videos by encoding the subtitles in the video itself.
- Conventional solutions may include the subtitles in the pixel scheme of the video, which generally results in the subtitles having static characteristics (e.g., position, font, font size) during the entire time that the video is being played.
- some traditional solutions draw the subtitles on top of the video using a third party API (application program interface).
- the third party API is independent of the media application that is rendering the video, and thus, unaware of how the video is being rendered.
- the third party API generally places the subtitles in one location on top of the video.
- subtitles that are generally immobile in position and have fixed font characteristics.
- Conventional subtitle solutions may impede a user's experience when the user is watching a video. For example, when a user watches a video on a mobile device in a horizontal orientation, the subtitles may be a large font size and may appear on the lower portion of the video. When the user changes the mobile device to a vertical orientation, the mobile device may change the size of the video, such that the video is much smaller.

- Implementations of the present disclosure customize the captioning for the media item that is being presented in the media UI based on how the media item is being rendered. For example, if the video is playing while the mobile device is in a portrait (vertical) orientation and is playing using the top third of the display of the mobile device, the captioning may have a small font size and the captioning may be animated. For example, the captioning may be scrolling across the horizontal length of the video. In another example, if the video is playing while the mobile device is in a landscape (horizontal) orientation and is playing using 90% of the display of the mobile device, the captioning may have a large font size and the captioning may not be animated.

- the server computer system can provide the document (e.g., webpage) with the appropriate captioning to the mobile device, and the mobile device renders the document to present the media item with the appropriate captioning to the user.
- the captioning module determines whether the rendering mode has changed. For example, the captioning module may receive an event notification from the media application. The change can be based on the orientation of the mobile device and/or user input pertaining to how the video is to be played. For example, the captioning module may determine that the mobile device is changed from being in a first orientation to a second orientation. For example, the captioning module may determine that the mobile device is changed from being in a portrait orientation to a landscape orientation. In another example, the captioning module may determine that the mobile device is changed from being in a landscape orientation to a portrait orientation.
- the captioning module may receive user input changing one of the elements of the user interface.
- a user may initially view a video using a first rendering mode (e.g., rendering mode 131 in Figure 1), and the user may provide input to the captioning module to change the playing of the video to use a second rendering mode (e.g., rendering mode 137 in Figure 1).
- the first rendering mode may play the video in a portrait orientation using the top 30% portion of the display of the mobile device
- the second rendering mode may play the video in the portrait orientation using 15% (e.g., bottom right corner) of the display of the mobile device.
- the orientation of the mobile device does not change, but an element (e.g., portion, location, etc.) in the media UI changes.
- the captioning module determines whether the presentation (e.g., playing) of the media item is complete at block 213.
- the captioning module may receive an event notification, for example, from the media application. If the presentation of the media item is not complete, the captioning module returns to block 207 to determine whether the rendering mode has changed. If the rendering mode has changed (block 207), the captioning module determines the set of captioning parameters that corresponds to the changed rendering mode at block 209. The captioning module can identify the changed rendering mode and can identify the set of captioning parameters that corresponds to the changed rendering mode.
- the captioning module may determine that the set of captioning parameters for the changed rendering mode includes using Font- 123, Font-Size-00, kerning of ZZ spacing between characters, position YY as a layer on top of the video, wrapping disabled, horizontal orientation, animation disabled, etc.
- the captioning module provides the captioning for the media item in the media UI based on the set of captioning parameters for the changed rendering mode. For example, the captioning module adjusts the existing captioning and/or creates new captioning to conform to Font- 123, Font-Size-00, kerning of ZZ spacing between characters, position YY as a layer on top of the video, wrapping disabled, horizontal orientation, animation disabled, etc.
- the captioning module sends data to the server computer system indicating the changed rendering mode
- the server computer system creates a document (e.g., webpage) with appropriate captioning based on the changed rendering mode and sends the document to the mobile device.

- the system architecture 300 can include one or more mobile devices 301, one or more servers 315,317, and one or more data stores 313 coupled to each other over one or more networks 310.
