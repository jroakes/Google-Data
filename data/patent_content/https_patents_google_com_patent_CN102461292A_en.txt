Abstract
A wireless terminal receives signaling information, pertaining to a reference signal transmission in at least one specifically designated sub frame, the signaling information including a list, the list including base station identities. The terminal determines, from at least one of the base station identities in the list, the time-frequency resources associated with a reference signal transmission intended for observed time difference of arrival (OTDOA) measurements from a transmitting base station associated with said one base station identity. The time of arrival of a transmission from the transmitting base station, relative to reference timing, is measured. The wireless terminal can receive a command from a serving cell to start performing inter-frequency OTDOA measurement on a frequency layer containing reference signals, the frequency layer distinct from the serving frequency layer, the serving frequency layer not containing positioning reference signals. The wireless terminal can perform OTDOA measurements subsequent to the reception of the command on a carrier frequency different from the serving cell carrier frequency. A base station transmitter can jointly schedule a reference signal transmission from a plurality of base station transmitters for the purpose of OTD estimation enhancement, and transmit identical reference signals from the plurality of base station transmitters, the reference signals being identical both in the signal sequence and time-frequency resources used for transmission.
Description
Technical field
Interference Control, signal-quality optimization and signaling that the disclosure relates to the performance of arrival observed time difference (OTDOA) measurement of raising in wireless receiver strengthen the purpose that helps customer location to estimate at wireless network to be used for.
Background technology
Cordless communication network is well-known.Some complete networks are proprietary, and other one or more standard regulations that then receive are the public system manufacturing equipment to allow supplier, such as wireless terminal.So measured network is UMTS (UMTS).UMTS carries out standardization by third generation partner program (3GPP), and 3GPP is the cooperation of formulating within the scope of international mobile telecommunication-2000 plan in International Telecommunication Union between the telecommunications industry association group of the global third generation applicatory (3G) mobile telephone system standard.Current UMTS standard of making great efforts with exploitation evolution, it is commonly called the UMTS land wireless access (E-UTRA) of UMTS Long Term Evolution (LTE) or evolution.
According to the version 8 of E-UTRA or LTE standard or standard, (also be known as " node-b of enhancing " or " eNB ") simply utilized OFDM (OFDM) to the downlink communication of wireless terminal or communication equipment (also being known as " subscriber equipment " or " UE ") from the base station.In OFDM, come the modulation orthogonal subcarrier to form one group of OFDM code element with the digital stream that can comprise data, control information or out of Memory.Subcarrier can be adjacent or non-adjacent, and can use QPSK (QPSK), 16 yuan of quadrature amplitude modulation (16QAM), 64 yuan of quadrature amplitude modulation (64QAM) or the like to carry out the down link data modulation.The OFDM code element is configured to downlink subframe to be used for from base station transmits.Each OFDM code element has the duration and is associated with Cyclic Prefix (CP).Cyclic Prefix is the protection period between the OFDM code element continuous in subframe in essence.According to the E-UTRA standard, normal cyclic prefix is about five (5) microseconds and extended cyclic prefix is about 16.67 microseconds.
Contrast with down link, utilize single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) according to the uplink communication of E-UTRA standard from UE to eNB.In SC-FDMA, subcarrier is mapped to the piece transmission that conventional OFDM modulator is carried out the QAM data symbols through first discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-expansion (or precoding) and after this.The use of DFT precoding allows to cause the cubic metric/peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of appropriateness of cost, size and power consumption of the minimizing of UE power amplifier.According to SC-FDMA, each subcarrier that is used for ul transmissions comprises the information of the modulated signal that is used for all emissions, and wherein the input traffic expansion is on subcarrier.Transfer of data in up link is controlled by eNB, comprises the transmission of the dispatch request (and schedule information) of sending via downlink control channel.The scheduling grant that is used for ul transmissions is provided on down link by eNB, and except other, also comprises resource allocation (for example, each millisecond (ms) resource block size at interval) and be ready to use in the sign of the modulation of ul transmissions.Along with the more modulation of high-order and the adding of adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), be possible through using the favourable big spectrum efficiency of channel condition dispatched users.
The E-UTRA system also helps on down link, to use many inputs and how output (MIMO) antenna systems are with the raising capacity.As known with Fig. 2 in illustrated, through use a plurality of transmitting antennas 204 at eNB 202 places and through use a plurality of reception antennas at UE place employing MIMO antenna system.UE can rely on the pilot tone of sending from eNB 202 or reference signal (RS) to carry out channel estimating, follow-up data demodulates, and the link quality measurements that is used for reporting.The link quality measurements that is used to feed back can be included as such spatial parameter: the number of the order indication or the data flow of on same asset, sending; Pre-coding matrix indication (PMI); And coding parameter, such as modulation and encoding scheme (MCS) or channel quality indication (CQI).For example, can support to surpass one order if UE confirms link, then it can report a plurality of CQI values (for example, two CQI values when order=2).In addition, can be in one of feedback model of being supported, based on (as by the eNB indication) cycle or aperiodic report link quality measurements.Report can comprise the broadband or the sub-bands of frequencies selective information of parameter.ENB can use order information, CQI and such as other parameter of uplink quality information with service UE on uplink channel and downlink channel.
As also know, current cell phone comprises that global positioning system (GPS) receiver is in case of emergency to help positioning equipment and their owner and to follow the E-911 laws and decrees from Federal Communications Committee (FCC).Under most of situation, the infrastructure that the GPS receiver of phone can receive signal and this information is sent to cellular system from the gps satellite of proper number is to be used for confirming through the location server that for example is coupled to wireless network or forms the part of wireless network the position of this equipment.Yet, have the invalid certain situation of GPS receiver.For example, when user and his or her cell phone were positioned at building, the GPS receiver possibly receive signal so that location server can be confirmed the position of this equipment from the gps satellite of proper number.In addition, the wireless device in private system need not satisfy FCC E-911 laws and decrees and possibly not comprise the GPS receiver.Yet the situation of the position of the wireless device that possibly confirm in such system, to operate possibly rise.
Summary of the invention
In order to compensate possible intermittent invalid of gps system and in private system, to provide location determination capabilities, many wireless systems to utilize signaling and comprise the processing that to estimate the position of wireless device through it.For example; In many systems; The location reference signals that launch by wireless device reception and use termly the base station (for example can calculate based on its infrastructure equipment such as location server with definite; Via triangulation and/or trilateration) information of the position of wireless device, perhaps independently (that is, originally be in) position of confirming wireless device at wireless device.When location server plans to calculate the position of wireless device; The time (TOA) that wireless device can be confirmed to arrive after receiving location reference signals or the time of advent poor (TDOA) information and this TOA or TDOA are sent to location server via serving BS (that is the base station of radio communication service, is provided to this wireless device).Usually, according to known technology based on as the internal clocking of the wireless device set up by the local oscillator of wireless device confirm TOA or TDOA information.
Ongoing work provides the method that is used for detent mechanism in 3GPP wireless standard forum; Its realized with current for other wireless access type provided quite even the ability and the performance that surmount, other wireless access type comprises GSM, WCDMA, 1xRTT and EV-DO.Guarantee with the network volume UE backward compatibility of supporting according to the LTE of 3GPP standard version 8 and EPS in comprise and support that stationkeeping ability and the characteristic that is associated with the LTE access are the purposes of this work.Desired stationkeeping ability and characteristic comprise:
-location protocol or with the control plane LCS solution that is used for EPS and OMASUPL compatible and make it possible to support to be used for the control plane LCS solution of EPS and the agreement of OMA SUPL;

Even network is not synchronous, such The Application of Technology also is known, comprise that the base station that constitutes network does not have aligning still to have the situation of known mutual timing slip in time.
Particularly, UE report is used for the relative timing of synchronized cells and asynchronous cell, then its to reach network definite to permit the completing place for regularly carrying out any correction between relative BS (base station).
Network or LS can further launch relative eNB and regularly independently confirm (being the center with UE) to allow UE to carry out; But this also needs network or LS to make specific eNB position can use for the secure entity among UE or the UE, and this is that network operator possibly not hope to do.

Embodiment
Except the enhancing of basic reference signal sequence, can also be optimized using OTD waveform observability (being SINR) such as minizone (comprising between the sector) coordination approach of COMP method.
The time that strengthens between minizone or sector that one embodiment comprises disclosed herein is observed the method that the transmission of poor (OTD) signal is coordinated.For example, a plurality of eNB 103,104,105 (Fig. 1) of the OTD measuring-signal that emission strengthens can jointly do this, for example take identical, or relevant but jointly or the temporal frequency district of common scheduling.If use identical temporal frequency district, then can report to be used for single " virtual " eNB that OTD measures purpose by UE 110." virtual " eNB like this can adopt the OTD measured waveform that is different from the eNB that comprises joint transmission or the OTD measured waveform or the sequence of sequence.Can preferentially use identical eNB control down the synchro transmitter of operation (for example, same base station site put altogether (colocated) sector) accomplish such joint transmission.In this method, put the sector altogether and on overlapping time-frequency resources, launch identical waveform.In an embodiment; All available PCID can be divided into disjoint set S1, S2 ...., SN, wherein S representes to be assigned to the set of being put the PCID of sector (or replacedly approaching sector or sub-district on geography) by the difference of identical eNB control altogether.See that from the viewpoint of disposing PCID is that the index n of " sector ID " and the Sn that is mapped to given base station site is " cell site ID ".Cell site ID is mapped to unique waveform then.If site deployment (is for example supported remote antenna; Via RF) through optical fiber; Then eNB can jointly dispatch the transmission from one or more remote antennas of at least one the OTD sequence with the OTD sequence that is different from female eNB under the identical eNB control, to be used for the purpose that OTD estimates.UE can jointly estimate the OTD of each eNB that has jointly dispatched the measurement pattern of optimizing.Joint transmission can be restricted to the only part subclass of the Resource Block (RB) on down link, and eNB can not give other user with data dispatch among the RB of utilization neatly in the position is auxiliary.Also should be able to the RB that partly is filled with the position pilot tone be distributed to the version 9 or version 10 users of rate-matched data around UE suitably.If whole PDSCH partly is preserved for position auxiliary (via multicast and broadcast unifrequency network or MBSFN signaling or alternatively, clean culture signaling), then eNB can use physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) to send extra position supplementary.Because excessive expense in system information (24 bits, add additional bits), so the MBSFN signaling is not preferred.In this embodiment, as the method in the wireless base station, comprise jointly scheduling and estimate the purpose that strengthens to be used for OTD from least two transmitter transmitting sequences.In addition in this embodiment, the time-frequency resources of combined dispatching can be identical at each transmitter place.Perhaps, each transmitter can be under the control of single eNB.The sequence of perhaps, being launched is by the wireless network transaction identifiers applicatory of PCID, global cell identifier (GCID), System Frame Number (SFN), subframe index, single subdistrict or one or more foundation the in the measured channel.
An embodiment relates to minizone OTD and measures the enhancement mode transmission.System information block (or SIB) can carry the measurement pattern of the expansion that can be applicable to peripheral cell to permit the OTD estimation of UE 110 those sub-districts of scheduling.SIB can carry the relation between (via " neighbor list " or analogous list) PCID and " pattern ", or this can be stipulated in the 3GPP standard.Can arrange that the measurement pattern of expansion is optimized with double static interference characteristic according to re-use pattern therefor.The neighbor cell pattern information can also be confirmed through at least a portion that reads neighbor cell system information (for example, the untapped bit among main broadcast channel (PBCH) or the SIB).Can come the emission measurement pattern based on every carrier wave.For example, can send in measurement pattern and PCID and the carrier frequency at least one.The enough signal sending modes of ability are to comprise at least one in the following
A. the skew of (one or more) subframe, wherein emission OTDOA waveform (for example, with respect to System Frame Number or SFN skew) on this subframe around point
B. cycle of (one or more) OTDOA subframe (for example, in a plurality of subframes)
C. time-frequency resources unit (RE) pattern in (one or more) OTDOA subframe.
The base station is transmitted into UE with measurement pattern with signal in the broadcasting of the relation between the neighbor cell of the expansion signal that makes UE to confirm to receive and this expansion signal of emission.Adopt this method, UE can confirm to have launched the time-frequency resources from the OTD waveform of different base station above that.In this embodiment, to wireless terminal, this method is included in broadcast singal and (for example, receives SIB) or in radio-resource-configuration (RRC) message and information with the measurement pattern of the corresponding expansion of OTD signal that is applicable to Serving cell and neighbor cell.UE receives neighbor cell lists and the PCID of neighbor cell and the relation between the measurement pattern.This method can comprise that reception is exclusively used in the measurement pattern of carrier frequency.This method can comprise and receives the measurement pattern defer to the special time frequency reuse mode.This method can comprise that at least a portion through reading neighbor cell broadcasting (for example, PBCH, SIB) receives measurement pattern.This method can comprise from the measurement pattern of eNB reception with the signal emission; This comprises that further reception is with respect in the cycle of the relativity shift of (one or more) OTDOA subframe of reference point (for example, SFN is around point), (one or more) OTDOA subframe, the temporal frequency RE pattern in (one or more) OTDOA subframe at least one.
Another embodiment relates to the OTDOA measurement provides the agreement support.1/ layer of 2 method of layer will be supported the location protocol as SUPL 2.0.UE 110 can enumerate it can be with some base station 103-105 of measuring of order (for example, RSRP, RS-SINR or the like), and can ask network (NW) to send the information about the OTDOA waveform from its sub-district that can measure.NW can send and the corresponding temporal frequency information of transmission of at least one subclass from the base station of request.To wireless terminal, this embodiment comprises the method for in wireless terminal, discerning and enumerate the base station according to particular sorted order (for example, RSRP, RS-SINR).This method can comprise neighbor cell lists is sent to eNB to be used to transmit the purpose of OTDOA waveform.To the wireless base station, this embodiment is included in the wireless base station and receives method of reporting from UE, and said report comprises the information of at least one base station 103,104,105 that can see about this UE.Method can comprise from one or more base stations receptions (for example, on X2 or from location server 108) and the corresponding temporal frequency information of OTDOA waveform.This method may further include (on SIB or RRC or PDCCH) emission and the OTDOA waveform corresponding temporal frequency information of different base stations with use.
Another embodiment relates to gap configuration between the frequency that is used for the OTDOA measurement.Because the interference to the service carrier frequency is the function to the loading of service/neighbor cell, so possibly cause serving/scene of the OTDOA measurement variation of neighbor cell.Possible preferred disposition UE is with the OTDOA of measurement cell on other less carrier wave of loading.In this case, NW at first configuration UE on the particular carrier wave frequency, detect the RSRP or the like and the report of its sub-district that can see.Then, NW can be configured in the auxiliary OTDOA measurement in the gap on the carrier wave between those frequencies.On the certain layer that is based on " measurability " of sub-district, this can be inferred that NW can dispose specific UE and measure on the particular carrier wave frequency, specific cell is carried out OTDOA by NW based on the RSRP/RSPRQ report from UE.The subframe of SFN between frequency on the carrier wave and OTDOA subframe possibly be unknown for the Serving cell in the asynchronous network regularly.Under the sort of situation, UE can read the MIB of specific cell and send it to Serving cell on carrier wave between frequency, makes it gap to be provided in the suitable moment.Depend on OTDOA subframe structure and cycle, new clearance mode possibly be defined within the RRC/RRM standard.For example, if all OTDOA waveforms are launched, then possibly equal the emission gap length (TGL) of 2ms (=1ms signal reception+2*0.5RF switching time) at least in a sub-frame.For synchronous deployment, the TGL of 3ms possibly be necessary, because be affected with afterwards subframe before the OTDOA subframe.Likewise, if the OTDOA waveform with broadcasting periodically such as 240ms, then the gap cycle should be preferably 240ms or its multiple.Can accomplish clearance mode based on each UE through RRC message disposes and removes.The clearance mode configuration can implicitly be inferred as the part of the RRC message that comprises the positional information that sends to UE by UE.To wireless terminal, this embodiment comprises from NW receive frequency measurements configuration order.This method can comprise on carrier wave between the frequency of customized configuration for cell identification with carry out RSRP or Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) and measure, and trigger report.This method can comprise through on carrier wave between frequency, reading and be used for sub-district MIB and report to Serving cell detecting SFN regularly.This method can comprise that receiving order from NW measures to begin carrying out OTDOA.This method can comprise receiving orders, and wherein said order includes the information of closing the moment of having launched the transmission gap (through the configuration of for example OTDOA measurement clearance and follow-up the removing after timer expiration or measurement report) from Serving cell.To the wireless base station, this embodiment can comprise the measurement report of being made up of PCID on carrier wave between CF and RSRP/RSRQ from the UE reception.This method can comprise the SFN information that receives the sub-district of detecting from UE.This method can comprise according to SFN of at least one PCID, report or the like comes time location definite and the corresponding OTDOA subframe of neighbor cell.This method can be included as UE configuration OTDOA measurement clearance so that it can switch to the particular carrier wave frequency.This method can comprise in response to timer expiration or from UE and receives the OTDOA measurement report and stop measurement clearance.
Another embodiment relates to signal emission location reference signals (PRS) position, carrier frequency, neighbor cell lists and other additional information in time.Common sense be that down link OTDOA will be used to location estimation.This algorithm relies on the ability of UE from the eNB except service eNB " monitoring " signal.As if research show that from the existing common reference code element of measurability viewpoint be not enough.Therefore, propose to launch new position reference code element (PRS) periodically from each eNB by a plurality of companies.PRS will be launched on special " PRS " subframe periodically.Should be noted that any given eNB goes up emission with the only part Resource Unit (RE) in subframe.In at least one execution mode, all RE and the PRS except distributing to those of control code element will can't help given eNB and use.
In synchro system, the PRS transmission is synchronous between all eNB.This has some advantages, comprising:
1. UE can monitor other eNB during the PRS subframe in eNB be not used for any RE of emissioning controling signal or PRS signal.Therefore, during at least a portion of PRS subframe, service eNB is quiet.In these RE, greatly reduced interference and UE and can more easily monitor other eNB.
2. can greatly reduce search efforts for UE.UE only need search for the PRS subframe and seek PRS sequence (it is located in the PRS subframe).
In asynchronous system, subframe is not synchronous and therefore can gets the PRS subframe is not synchronous.Generally speaking, can not suppose from the timing relationship between the PRS subframe of different eNB emissions.Under these circumstances; ENB no longer can make UE can through come to monitor better from quiet single subframe all other eNB (although if service eNB has the knowledge of when sending the PRS subframe as neighbours eNB, then eNB can be quiet to allow UE to monitor from the neighbours' that select PRS transmission).Therefore, in asynchronous system, only if the quiet otherwise measurability variation of service eNB between the PRS subframe transmission period in each neighbours eNB.
In addition, because PRS subframe on non-service eNB is not synchronized to those PRS subframes of service eNB, so UE does not know where seek the PRS subframe, so and UE scanning search PRS sequence continuously.In this case, in fact problem detects more complicated than SCH.For SCH detects, can guarantee that for UE the SCH transmission is positioned at 6 continuous subframes.Therefore, UE can come scanning search SCH with non real-time mode through the sampling that cushions 6 milliseconds.Because possibly per 100 subframes only send the PRS subframe one time, so UE will grasp 101 milliseconds sampling to realize non real-time scanning search PRS sequence.
At last, should be understood that UE must detect needed signal level from neighbours eNB detection signal to be lower than the RRM Cell searching via synchronizing channel in order to locate purpose.Therefore, the set (with the timing of correspondence) of the neighbours eNB that is found via the RRM Cell searching by UE is not enough to discern the eNB that measure for the position order.
In a word, do not have in the synchronous asynchronous system in the PRS subframe:
I) UE does not know where search for the PRS sequence, because it does not know the position of PRS subframe.
Ii) UE does not know which PRS sequence which PRS eNB does not know to search for nearby and therefore.
Under situation not from certain help of service eNB, the detection of PRS than the detection of SCH more complicated with difficulty and much complicated on calculating.
Further point out, will in very large search volume, carry out the blind Detecting of PRS sequence quite badly.The blind Detecting of each PRS sequence will require each PRS sequence relevant during 100 milliseconds with all possible timing hypothesis, and for the bandwidth of 10MHz, the needed relevant number of each PRS sequence will be above 1,500,000.For blind Detecting, we will adopt the corresponding timing of the maximum relevant with these usually.Yet, for weak signal, will surpass relevant with the desired signal of existence usually lacking relevant maximums a large amount of under the situation of desired signal, and therefore, timing estimation will be incorrect.In order to limit complexity and to improve performance, the scope of essential restriction search volume.For this reason, the content below we have proposed.
From UE or after position requests is initiated in another source, eNB should:
The index of (predefined) PRS sequence that i) UE should be searched for is transmitted into UE with signal; And
Ii) will be transmitted into UE with signal with the position (timing information) of the corresponding PRS subframe of each PRS sequence.
Can also in SIB message, broadcast this information periodically.
In asynchronous system, the PRS subframe of each neighbor cell is two sub-frame of overlapping service eNB (in addition, these two eNB are synchronous) partly.Therefore, the index of eNB (Serving cell) first subframe that will will overlap with the next PRS subframe of neighbor cell to launch UE with signal.Then, UE will be in the initial search that begins 2 milliseconds of time intervals with the subframe index of the PRS sequence of neighbor cell.In this manner, the scouting interval reduces to 2 milliseconds from 101 milliseconds.
To the timing of the PRS subframe of neighbours eNB, the resolution of the timing information that can use service eNB can be much littler than 1 millisecond of subframe duration.In this case, eNB can also reduce the mobile search space for neighbours PRS subframe through more accurate timing information is provided to UE.Especially, the subframe index and the symbol index of the eNB first subframe/code element that can overlap with next PRS subframe transmit to mobile phone.In this case, UE will search for this code element and an ensuing N continuous code element is sought the PRS sequence, and wherein, N is the number of symbols of each subframe.Perhaps, eNB can send to UE to minimize the PRS sequence search interval for UE with this timing information with high-resolution.
The cycle of PRS subframe can dispose through network.If like this, the cycle should be included in the SIB broadcasting.Generally speaking, not every network can be selected the identical cycle for the PRS subframe.In addition, not every eNB can use the identical cycle.Depend on offered load, eNB can select more continually or still less broadcast continually the PRS subframe.In such execution mode, we can be the shortest time interval T of periodic transfer definition of PRS signal.Be not to use this shortest time interval, some networks and/or the eNB in this network can use this of interval T of integral multiple to be used for the periodic transfer of PRS basic time.Yet, in this case, should define the transmission time to make in synchronizing network, any eNB that uses the doubly basic transmission intercal T of identical N be time alignment so that not only simplified the PRS search but also improved the measurability of PRS.If with signal emission PRS information, then SIB should comprise the frequency layer of launching the PRS subframe above that on SIB.
In some instances, network can only support the PRS transmission so that minimize relevant expense on some frequency layer but not on other.Perhaps, the TOA that possibly on a frequency layer, not have enough " can monitor " eNB to make UE obtain enough numbers measures to obtain reliable position and estimates.In such instance, except the index of PRS transmission with regularly, network must be transmitted into UE with signal with frequency layer.Be different from the Serving cell carrier wave if launch the frequency layer of PRS above that, then Serving cell need dispose the OTDOA measurement clearance.Serving cell should not dispatched so that UE can be displaced to its RF the target frequency layer and carry out and measure DL and/or UL data.In such scene, eNB should be transmitted into UE (for example, with the initial corresponding SFN index/subframe index/symbol index in gap, gap duration etc.) with signal with the timing in this gap.
In order to improve measurability, the PRS sequence can with respect to the set of the Resource Unit that is assigned with or distribute to these RE value sequence and change periodically.If like this, UE dedicated signaling or MIB message should provide enough information with the current state of indication for the PRS sequence of given eNB.For example, if PRS is transmitted in displacement periodically between N the value, then should provide index to provide the state of PRS when next time transmitting.
Some aspects relevant with signaling are following:
1. OTDOA measures and will be executed on the PRS subframe probably or (for example be executed on the low interfering subframe in LTE version 9; Pass through CRS; Serving cell is quiet simultaneously); And in UTRA, when service provides IPDL gap (that is the set of the time slot of the quiet transmission of Serving cell), go up the execution measurement at CPICH (FDD) or another channel (TDD) with the signal emission.
2. three deployment scenario can be arranged.In this application, term " OTDOA subframe " is used to indicate UE to be used for the subframe that OTDOA measures, no matter whether it comprises the PRS transmission or the quiet CRS transmission of Serving cell is only arranged.
A) synchronously-all hereto OTDOA subframes all aimed at and the SFN number of different districts can be aim at or can misalignment.UE need in the little search window of Serving cell PRS transmission, seek PRS (for example, for normal CP search window size or SWS=3*CP～15us-UE can from Serving cell OTDOA subframe+/-find the OTDOA subframe the cited neighbours in the SWS).
B) aligning-the OTDOA subframe overlaps (for example, 500us) part for this situation.UE need be from seeking the PRS transmission in such as the neighbours in the sub-frame the Serving cell PRS subframe (for example, search window=1 sub-frame).Even for this situation, the SFN number of Serving cell and neighbor cell can be aim at or can misalignment.For this situation, surpass one subframe and can be used for PRS transmission (for example, can launch 2 or more a plurality of continuous subframes) and make overlapping between all transmitting base stations of OTDOA subframe be 1ms at least with specific PRS pattern.And, can be to continuing 2 or more a plurality of continuous subframes from the transmission of certain base station (for example, Serving cell) is quiet.Can use following two kinds combination: to quiet 2 or more a plurality of continuous subframe, lasting 2 or the more a plurality of continuous subframe of the base station OTDOA subframe of different subclass simultaneously of continuing in the base station of a subset.
C) asynchronous-for this situation, the OTDOA subframe can have no overlapping.For this situation, the SFN number is not aimed at.For this situation; The maximum cycle that can search window size be set to the transmission of OTDOA subframe (for example; If maximum OTDOA subframe transmission cycle is 320ms, then be provided with search window size=320us will allow UE find Serving cell OTDOA subframe+/-all neighbours in the SWS).Further can be through coming assistance to be provided to UE with the thick timing slip of signal emission with respect to the nearest OTDOA subframe of the neighbor cell of Serving cell.Perhaps, for asynchronous condition, possibly specially designed PRS transmission possibly during using the CRS+ Serving cell quiet, be no advantage.For this situation, it will be useful handling with auxiliary UE with relevant timing uncertainty with respect to the subframe skew of the neighbor cell of Serving cell with the signal emission.CRS transmission has the 10ms cycle and knows that subframe timing slip in the radio frames will help UE to limit it and from the sizes related of (one or more) of Serving cell quiet subframe corresponding CRS template on opportunity.For example, it is uncertain rather than 1ms received signal and the 10ms template is related that length that can the CRS template is set to timing that 1ms+ and neighbours' subframe regularly be associated.This auxiliary signaling has reduced complexity and has improved performance.In order to contain all possible situation, signaling should comprise following.
I. service eNB directly or via search window size (for example, SWS=3*CP is used for synchronously, and SWS=0.5ms or 1ms are used for part and aim at, and SWS=is used for greatly asynchronous) is launched deployment scenario (for example, synchronous, the part aligning or asynchronous) with signal.
Ii. service eNB is with the tabulation of signal emission PCID or Site ID, for the tabulation of this PCID or Site ID with the corresponding search window of all neighbours in can find the OTDOA subframe.
Iii. service eNB is transmitted in SFN-SFN between itself and the neighbor cell poor (perhaps, service eNB can only be launched and state corresponding " seed " variable quantity from the PRS transmission of neighbor cell) with signal.
Iv. Serving cell is with signal emission and neighbor cell associated frequency information.Different frequency layer can have different neighbor cell lists and only the subclass of all possible frequency layer can be used for OTDOA subframe transmission.
V. for asynchronous condition, service eNB can regularly replace the signaling search window size for neighbours provide the thick OTDOA subframe with respect to itself.
Vi. for asynchronous condition, service eNB can enough signal emission Serving cells quiet opportunity.UE seeks all neighbours in (one or more) quiet subframe.Auxiliary data can comprise the set of PCID and can comprise in addition with respect to the neighbours' of service eNB subframe skew (because CRS transmits every 10ms and repeats once) and relevant timing uncertainty and handling to help UE.
Another embodiment to wireless terminal can comprise that the relevant signaling information of reference signal transmission that receives with having in time on repeat pattern (for example, every N=320 sub-frame one/two sub-frame are designated as the OTDOA subframe) (one or more) specially appointed subframe (being also referred to as the OTDOA subframe) is used to comprise the PCID of base station 103,104,105 or the serving BS and the neighbours base station of Site ID tabulation.This method can comprise reception and the corresponding frequency layer information of serving BS and neighbours base station.This method can also comprise that receiving the minimum be associated with reference signal transmission measures the purpose of bandwidth with the OTDOA measurement that is used to be applicable to all neighbor cells.This method can also comprise receive to dispose type information, deployment types information via direct indication or via the UE search window size with whether be that aim at, the part aligning or asynchronous relevant from service and neighbours' OTDOA subframe transmission.This method can comprise the system timing of reception with respect to the neighbor cell of Serving cell, and this can be that each neighbour is with respect to the SFN-SFN timing difference of Serving cell and/or the state-state difference of PRS transmission.This method can comprise: receive indication and (for example be used for CRS that OTDOA measures and relevant information from (one or more) of Serving cell quiet subframe with use; The SFN+ subframe numbers), expectation UE carries out neighbor cell OTDOA measurement on from the quiet subframe of Serving cell; Receive the subframe-subframe timing difference of neighbours further with respect to Serving cell.This method can comprise to be confirmed to be used for the time-frequency resources that the reference signal transmission of OTDOA measurement is associated with intention.This method can also comprise that measurement is with respect to reference to regularly time of advent from the transmission of base station.
Another embodiment relates to exchange PRS timing information between eNB.Service eNB can use S 1 or X2 interface to find the timing of its neighbours' PRS subframe (for example, with respect to himself neighbour regularly SFN number and subframe index).They can exchange the corresponding gps system of the transmission time with they PRS subframes separately if service eNB and neighbours eNB both have GPS.Can not visit in the instance of gps system time in service eNB and/or neighbours eNB, must use other method to report this timing slip.In such method, service eNB will ask neighbours eNB to provide the time interval till it has launched its next PRS subframe, and as response, neighbours eNB will report this time interval.In order to explain this information, service eNB knows needs for S 1 or the round trip time-delay of X2 interface between itself and neighbours eNB.This time-delay can be used such as those agreements that identified among the IEEE 1588 and calibrate.System timing information based on second base station; First base station uses this timing information that the transmission of OTDOA reference signal is dispatched then, wherein to transmission dispatch make overlapping substantially in time and be different substantially from the transmission of the OTDOA reference signal of first base station and second base station from the OTDOA reference signal of first base station and second base station.Reference signal is included in the sequence of the code element of launching on one group of time-frequency resources.If different between two base stations for employed sequence of reference signal transmission or employed time-frequency resources, then reference signal is different.
Present embodiment has explained that the PRS transmission in the LTE version 9 can be by the possibility of aiming at fully or part is aimed at.The timing of setting up between the base station possibly accomplished via GNSS (GNSS)/GPS and/or through the inter base station communication of X2.For LTE, the correlation behavior of the timing of the OTDOA subframe that is associated with those transmission and pseudo random number (for example, SFN number) generator is useful amount for be transmitted into UE with signal with auxiliary UE processing especially.This embodiment can comprise that wherein timing information can be and OTDOA subframe corresponding frame of reference time (for example, GNSS, GPS) through the wireless base station of S1 or the X2 interface and the second base station exchange OTDOA subframe transmit timing information.Timing information can be from the transmission of the SFN-SFN difference correlation of two sub-districts or only be to transmit corresponding state-state difference with PRS from two sub-districts especially.Timing information can be corresponding to the time that is carved into next PRS transmission from emission during signaling.This method can also comprise that exchange comprises other additional information of the cycle of PRS transmission, the timing information relevant with the 3rd base station etc.
Therefore, (UE 110, Fig. 1) receive the signaling information of the reference signal transmission in relevant at least one specially appointed subframe, and this signaling information comprises tabulation, and this tabulation comprises the Base Station Identification of being stated as in the step 501 of Fig. 5 can to see wireless terminal.In square frame 502, wireless terminal confirms with intention from the transmitting base station relevant with a described Base Station Identification it is to be used to arrive the time-frequency resources that the reference signal transmission of observed time difference (OTDOA) measurement is associated according in the Base Station Identification in this tabulation at least one.In step 503, measure from the transmission of transmitting base station with respect to reference to the fixed time of advent.Carry out this novel operation of the present invention, illustrated processor in the wireless terminal of said processor such as Fig. 2 under the control of the program that can in the processor among the UE 110, carry out.
According to another embodiment; (UE 110, Fig. 1) receive order to begin the frequency layer that comprises reference signal, the frequency layer that is different from the service frequency layer, to carry out OTDOA measurement between frequency like the service frequency layer that does not comprise location reference signals indicated in the step 601 Fig. 6 from Serving cell (base station 103,104 or 105) for wireless terminal.In step 602, wireless terminal 110 can be carried out OTDOA and measure on the carrier frequency that is different from the Serving cell carrier frequency after receiving order.Carry out this novel operation of the present invention, illustrated processor in the wireless terminal of said processor such as Fig. 2 under the control of the program that can in the processor in UE 110, carry out.
