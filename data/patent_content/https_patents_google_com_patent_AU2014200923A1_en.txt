Abstract
A visual query is received from a client system, along with location information for the client system, and processed by a server system. The server system sends the visual query and the location information to a visual query search system, and receives from the visual query search system enhanced location information based on the visual query and the location information. The server system then sends a search query, including the enhanced location information, to a location-based search system. The search system receives and provides to the client one or more search results to the client system.
Description
Regulation 3.2 AUSTRALIA Patents Act 1990 Complete Specification Standard Patent Divisional APPLICANT: Google Inc. Invention Title: HYBRID USE OF LOCATION SENSOR DATA AND VISUAL QUERY TO RETURN LOCAL LISTINGS FOR VISUAL QUERY The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method of performing it known to me: Hybrid Use of Location Sensor Data and Visual Query to Return Local Listings for Visual Query TECHNICAL FIELD 5 [0001] The disclosed embodiments relate generally to systems and methods of processing visual queries, and in particular to obtaining search results, including local listings physically located near a client device, in response to the visual query and location information associated with the client device. 10 BACKGROUND [0002] Text or term based searching, wherein a user inputs a word or phrase into a search engine and receives a variety of results is a useful tool for searching.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS [00321 Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be 4 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, circuits, and networks have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the embodiments. [00331 It will also be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first contact could be termed a second contact, and, similarly, a second contact could be termed a first contact, without departing from the scope of the present invention. The first contact and the second contact are both contacts, but they are not the same contact. [00341 The terminology used in the description of the invention herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used in the description of the invention and the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will also be understood that the term "and/or" as used herein refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. It will be further understood that the terms "comprises" and/or "comprising," when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. [00351 As used herein, the term "if" may be construed to mean "when" or "upon" or "in response to determining" or "in response to detecting," depending on the context. Similarly, the phrase "if it is determined" or "if (a stated condition or event) is detected" may be construed to mean "upon determining" or "in response to determining" or "upon detecting (the stated condition or event)" or "in response to detecting (the stated condition or event)," depending on the context. [00361 Figure 1 is a block diagram illustrating a computer network that includes a visual query server system according to some embodiments. The computer network 100 includes one or more client systems 102 and a visual query server system (sometimes called the visual query system) 106. One or more communications networks 104 interconnect these components. The communications network 104 may be any of a variety of networks, including local area networks (LAN), wide area networks (WAN), wireless networks, wireline networks, the Internet, or a combination of such networks. 5 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 [00371 The client system 102 includes a client application 108, which is executed by the client system, for receiving a visual query (e.g., visual query 1102 of Fig 11). A visual query is an image that is submitted as a query to a search engine or search system. Examples of visual queries, without limitations include photographs, scanned documents and images, and drawings. In some embodiments, the client application 108 is selected from the set consisting of a search application, a search engine plug-in for a browser application, and a search engine extension for a browser application. In some embodiments, the client application 108 is an "omnivorous" search box, which allows a user to drag and drop any format of image into the search box to be used as the visual query. [00381 A client system 102 sends queries to and receives data from the visual query server system 106. The client system 102 may be any computer or other device that is capable of communicating with the visual query server system 106. Examples include, without limitation, desktop and notebook computers, mainframe computers, server computers, mobile devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants, network terminals, and set-top boxes. [00391 The visual query server system 106 includes a front end visual query processing server 110. The front end server 110 receives a visual query from the client 102, and sends the visual query to a plurality of parallel search systems 112 for simultaneous processing. The search systems 112 each implement a distinct visual query search process and access their corresponding databases 114 as necessary to process the visual query by their distinct search process. For example, a face recognition search system 12-A will access a facial image database 14-A to look for facial matches to the image query. As will be explained in more detail with regard to Figure 9, if the visual query contains a face, the facial recognition search system 112-A will return one or more search results (e.g., names, matching faces, etc.) from the facial image database 114-A. In another example, the optical character recognition (OCR) search system 112 B, converts any recognizable text in the visual query into text for return as one or more search results. In the optical character recognition (OCR) search system 112-B, an OCR database 114-B may be accessed to recognize particular fonts or text patterns as explained in more detail with regard to Figure 8. [00401 Any number of parallel search systems 112 may be used. Some examples include a facial recognition search system 112-A, an OCR search system 112-B, an image-to-terms search system I 12-C (which may recognize an object or an object category), a product recognition search system (which may be configured to recognize 2-D images such as book covers and CDs and may also be configured to recognized 3-D images such as furniture), bar 6 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 code recognition search system (which recognizes ID and 2D style bar codes), a named entity recognition search system, landmark recognition (which may configured to recognize particular famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and may also be configured to recognize a corpus of specific images such as billboards), place recognition aided by geo-location information provided by a GPS receiver in the client system 102 or mobile phone network, a color recognition search system, and a similar image search system (which searches for and identifies images similar to a visual query). Further search systems can be added as additional parallel search systems, represented in Figure 1 by system 112-N. All of the search systems, except the OCR search system, are collectively defined herein as search systems performing an image-match process. All of the search systems including the OCR search system are collectively referred to as query by-image search systems. In some embodiments, the visual query server system 106 includes a facial recognition search system 112-A, an OCR search system 112-B, and at least one other query-by-image search system 112. [00411 The parallel search systems 112 each individually process the visual search query and return their results to the front end server system 110. In some embodiments, the front end server 100 may perform one or more analyses on the search results such as one or more of: aggregating the results into a compound document, choosing a subset of results to display, and ranking the results as will be explained in more detail with regard to Figure 6. The front end server 110 communicates the search results to the client system 102. [00421 The client system 102 presents the one or more search results to the user. The results may be presented on a display, by an audio speaker, or any other means used to communicate information to a user. The user may interact with the search results in a variety of ways. In some embodiments, the user's selections, annotations, and other interactions with the search results are transmitted to the visual query server system 106 and recorded along with the visual query in a query and annotation database 116. Information in the query and annotation database can be used to improve visual query results. In some embodiments, the information from the query and annotation database 116 is periodically pushed to the parallel search systems 112, which incorporate any relevant portions of the information into their respective individual databases 114. [00431 The computer network 100 optionally includes a term query server system 118, for performing searches in response to term queries. A term query is a query containing one or more terms, as opposed to a visual query which contains an image. The term query server system 118 may be used to generate search results that supplement information produced by the various search engines in the visual query server system 106. The results returned from the term query 7 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 server system I 18 may include any format. The term query server system 118 may include textual documents, images, video, etc. While term query server system 118 is shown as a separate system in Figure 1, optionally the visual query server system 106 may include a term query server system 118. [00441 Additional information about the operation of the visual query server system 106 is provided below with respect to the flowcharts in Figures 2-4. [00451 Figure 2 is a flow diagram illustrating a visual query server system method for responding to a visual query, according to certain embodiments of the invention. Each of the operations shown in Figure 2 may correspond to instructions stored in a computer memory or computer readable storage medium. [00461 The visual query server system receives a visual query from a client system (202). The client system, for example, may be a desktop computing device, a mobile device, or another similar device (204) as explained with reference to Figure 1. An example visual query on an example client system is shown in Figure 11. [0047] The visual query is an image document of any suitable format. For example, the visual query can be a photograph, a screen shot, a scanned image, or a frame or a sequence of multiple frames of a video (206). In some embodiments, the visual query is a drawing produced by a content authoring program (736, Fig. 5). As such, in some embodiments, the user "draws" the visual query, while in other embodiments the user scans or photographs the visual query. Some visual queries are created using an image generation application such as Acrobat, a photograph editing program, a drawing program, or an image editing program. For example, a visual query could come from a user taking a photograph of his friend on his mobile phone and then submitting the photograph as the visual query to the server system. The visual query could also come from a user scanning a page of a magazine, or taking a screen shot of a webpage on a desktop computer and then submitting the scan or screen shot as the visual query to the server system. In some embodiments, the visual query is submitted to the server system 106 through a search engine extension of a browser application, through a plug-in for a browser application, or by a search application executed by the client system 102. Visual queries may also be submitted by other application programs (executed by a client system) that support or generate images which can be transmitted to a remotely located server by the client system. [00481 The visual query can be a combination of text and non-text elements (208). For example, a query could be a scan of a magazine page containing images and text, such as a person standing next to a road sign. A visual query can include an image of a person's face, 8 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 whether taken by a camera embedded in the client system or a document scanned by or otherwise received by the client system. A visual query can also be a scan of a document containing only text. The visual query can also be an image of numerous distinct subjects, such as several birds in a forest, a person and an object (e.g., car, park bench, etc.), a person and an animal (e.g., pet, farm animal, butterfly, etc.). Visual queries may have two or more distinct elements. For example, a visual query could include a barcode and an image of a product or product name on a product package. For example, the visual query could be a picture of a book cover that includes the title of the book, cover art, and a bar code. In some instances, one visual query will produce two or more distinct search results corresponding to different portions of the visual query, as discussed in more detail below. [00491 The server system processes the visual query as follows. The front end server system sends the visual query to a plurality of parallel search systems for simultaneous processing (210). Each search system implements a distinct visual query search process, i.e., an individual search system processes the visual query by its own processing scheme. [00501 In some embodiments, one of the search systems to which the visual query is sent for processing is an optical character recognition (OCR) search system. In some embodiments, one of the search systems to which the visual query is sent for processing is a facial recognition search system. In some embodiments, the plurality of search systems running distinct visual query search processes includes at least: optical character recognition (OCR), facial recognition, and another query-by-image process other than OCR and facial recognition (212). The other query-by-image process is selected from a set of processes that includes bat is not limited to product recognition, bar code recognition, object-or-object-category recognition, named entity recognition, and color recognition (212). [00511 In some embodiments, named entity recognition occurs as a post process of the OCR search system, wherein the text result of the OCR is analyzed for famous people, locations, objects and the like, and then the terms identified as being named entities are searched in the term query server system (118, Fig. 1). In other embodiments, images of famous landmarks, logos, people, album covers, trademarks, etc. are recognized by an image-to-terms search system. In other embodiments, a distinct named entity query-by-image process separate from the image-to terms search system is utilized. The object-or-object category recognition system recognizes generic result types like "car." In some embodiments, this system also recognizes product brands, particular product models, and the like, and provides more specific descriptions, like "Porsche." Some of the search systems could be special user specific search systems. For 9 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 example, particular versions of color recognition and facial recognition could be a special search systems used by the blind. [00521 The front end server system receives results from the parallel search systems (214). In some embodiments, the results are accompanied by a search score. For some visual queries, some of the search systems will find no relevant results. For example, if the visual query was a picture of a flower, the facial recognition search system and the bar code search system will not find any relevant results. In some embodiments, if no relevant results are found, a null or zero search score is received from that search system (216). In some embodiments, if the front end server does not receive a result from a search system after a pre-defined period of time (e.g., 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 or 5 seconds), it will process the received results as if that timed out server produced a null search score and will process the received results from the other search systems. [00531 Optionally, when at least two of the received search results meet pre-defined criteria, they are ranked (218). In some embodiments, one of the predefined criteria excludes void results. A pre-defined criterion is that the results are not void. In some embodiments, one of the predefined criteria excludes results having numerical score (e.g., for a relevance factor) that falls below a pre-defined minimum score. Optionally, the plurality of search results are filtered (220). In some embodiments, the results are only filtered if the total number of results exceeds a pre-defined threshold. In some embodiments, all the results are ranked but the results falling below a pre-defined minimum score are excluded. For some visual queries, the content of the results are filtered. For example, if some of the results contain private information or personal protected information, these results are filtered out. [00541 Optionally, the visual query server system creates a compound search result (222). One embodiment of this is when more than one search system result is embedded in an interactive results document as explained with respect to Figure 3. The term query server system (118, Fig. 1) may augment the results from one of the parallel search systems with results from a term search, where the additional results are either links to documents or information sources, or text and/or images containing additional information that may be relevant to the visual query. Thus, for example, the compound search result may contain an OCR result and a link to a named entity in the OCR document (224). [00551 In some embodiments, the OCR search system (112-B, Fig. 1) or the front end visual query processing server (110, Fig. 1) recognizes likely relevant words in the text. For example, it may recognize named entities such as famous people or places. The named entities are submitted as query terms to the term query server system (118, Fig. 1). In some 10 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 embodiments, the term query results produced by the term query server system are embedded in the visual query result as a "link." In some embodiments, the term query results are returned as separate links. For example, if a picture of a book cover were the visual query, it is likely that an object recognition search system will produce a high scoring hit for the book. As such a term query for the title of the book will be run on the term query server system 118 and the term query results are returned along with the visual query results. In some embodiments, the term query results are presented in a labeled group to distinguish them from the visual query results. The results may be searched individually, or a search may be performed using all the recognized named entities in the search query to produce particularly relevant additional search results. For example, if the visual query is a scanned travel brochure about Paris, the returned result may include links to the term query server system 118 for initiating a search on a term query "Notre Dame." Similarly, compound search results include results from text searches for recognized famous images. For example, in the same travel brochure, live links to the term query results for famous destinations shown as pictures in the brochure like "Eiffel Tower" and "Louvre" may also be shown (even if the terms "Eiffel Tower" and "Louvre" did not appear in the brochure itself.) [00561 The visual query server system then sends at least one result to the client system (226). Typically, if the visual query processing server receives a plurality of search results from at least some of the plurality of search systems, it will then send at least one of the plurality of search results to the client system. For some visual queries, only one search system will return relevant results. For example, in a visual query containing only an image of text, only the OCR server's results may be relevant. For some visual queries, only one result from one search system may be relevant. For example, only the product related to a scanned bar code may be relevant. In these instances, the front end visual processing server will return only the relevant search result(s). For some visual queries, a plurality of search results are sent to the client system, and the plurality of search results include search results from more than one of the parallel search systems (228). This may occur when more than one distinct image is in the visual query. For example, if the visual query were a picture of a person riding a horse, results for facial recognition of the person could be displayed along with object identification results for the horse. In some embodiments, all the results for a particular query by image search system are grouped and presented together. For example, the top N facial recognition results are displayed under a heading "facial recognition results" and the top N object recognition results are displayed together under a heading "object recognition results." Alternatively, as discussed below, the search results from a particular image search system may be grouped by image region. For example, if the visual query includes two faces, both of which produce facial recognition results, the results for each face would be presented as a distinct group. For some visual queries (e.g., a 11 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 visual query including an image of both text and one or more objects), the search results may include both OCR results and one or more image-match results (230). [00571 In some embodiments, the user may wish to learn more about a particular search result. For example, if the visual query was a picture of a dolphin and the "image to terms" search system returns the following terms "water," "dolphin," "blue," and "Flipper;" the user may wish to run a text based query term search on "Flipper." When the user wishes to run a search on a term query (e.g., as indicated by the user clicking on or otherwise selecting a corresponding link in the search results), the query term server system (118, Fig. 1) is accessed, and the search on the selected term(s) is run. The corresponding search term results are displayed on the client system either separately or in conjunction with the visual query results (232). In some embodiments, the front end visual query processing server (110, Fig. 1) automatically (i.e., without receiving any user command, other than the initial visual query) chooses one or more top potential text results for the visual query, runs those text results on the term query server system 118, and then returns those term query results along with the visual query result to the client system as a part of sending at least one search result to the client system (232). In the example above, if "Flipper" was the first term result for the visual query picture of a dolphin, the front end server runs a term query on "Flipper" and returns those term query results along with the visual query results to the client system. This embodiment, wherein a term result that is considered likely to be selected by the user is automatically executed prior to sending search results from the visual query to the user, saves the user time. In some embodiments, these results are displayed as a compound search result (222) as explained above. In other embodiments, the results are part of a search result list instead of or in addition to a compound search result. [00581 Figure 3 is a flow diagram illustrating the process for responding to a visual query with an interactive results document. The first three operations (202, 210, 214) are described above with reference to Figure 2. From the search results which are received from the parallel search systems (214), an interactive results document is created (302). [00591 Creating the interactive results document (302) will now be described in detail. For some visual queries, the interactive results document includes one or more visual identifiers of respective sub-portions of the visual query. Each visual identifier has at least one user selectable link to at least one of the search results. A visual identifier identifies a respective sub portion of the visual query. For some visual queries, the interactive results document has only one visual identifier with one user selectable link to one or more results. In some embodiments, a respective user selectable link to one or more of the search results has an activation region, and 12 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 the activation region corresponds to the sub-portion of the visual query that is associated with a corresponding visual identifier. [00601 In some embodiments, the visual identifier is a bounding box (304). In some embodiments, the bounding box encloses a sub-portion of the visual query as shown in Figure 12A. The bounding box need not be a square or rectangular box shape but can be any sort of shape including circular, oval, conformal (e.g., to an object in, entity in or region of the visual query), irregular or any other shape as shown in Figure 12B. For some visual queries, the bounding box outlines the boundary of an identifiable entity in a sub-portion of the visual query (306). In some embodiments, each bounding box includes a user selectable link to one or more search results, where the user selectable link has an activation region corresponding to a sub portion of the visual query surrounded by the bounding box. When the space inside the bounding box (the activation region of the user selectable link) is selected by the user, search results that correspond to the image in the outlined sub-portion are returned. [00611 In some embodiments, the visual identifier is a label (307) as shown in Figure 14. In some embodiments, label includes at least one term associated with the image in the respective sub-portion of the visual query. Each label is formatted for presentation in the interactive results document on or near the respective sub-portion. In some embodiments, the labels are color coded. [00621 In some embodiments, each respective visual identifiers is formatted for presentation in a visually distinctive manner in accordance with a type of recognized entity in the respective sub-portion of the visual query. For example, as shown in Figure 13, bounding boxes around a product, a person, a trademark, and the two textual areas are each presented with distinct cross-hatching patterns, representing differently colored transparent bounding boxes. In some embodiments, the visual identifiers are formatted for presentation in visually distinctive manners such as overlay color, overlay pattern, label background color, label background pattern, label font color, and border color. [00631 In some embodiments, the user selectable link in the interactive results document is a link to a document or object that contains one or more results related to the corresponding sub-portion of the visual query (308). In some embodiments, at least one search result includes data related to the corresponding sub-portion of the visual query. As such, when the user selects the selectable link associated with the respective sub-portion, the user is directed to the search results corresponding to the recognized entity in the respective sub-portion of the visual query. 13 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 [0064] For example, if a visual query was a photograph of a bar code, there may be portions of the photograph which are irrelevant parts of the packaging upon which the bar code was affixed. The interactive results document may include a bounding box around only the bar code. When the user selects inside the outlined bar code bounding box, the bar code search result is displayed. The bar code search result may include one result, the name of the product corresponding to that bar code, or the bar code results may include several results such as a variety of places in which that product can be purchased, reviewed, etc. [00651 In some embodiments, when the sub-portion of the visual query corresponding to a respective visual identifier contains text comprising one or more terms, the search results corresponding to the respective visual identifier include results from a term query search on at least one of the terms in the text. In some embodiments, when the sub-portion of the visual query corresponding to a respective visual identifier contains a person's face for which at least one match (i.e., search result) is found that meets predefined reliability (or other) criteria, the search results corresponding to the respective visual identifier include one or more of: name, handle, contact information, account information, address information, current location of a related mobile device associated with the person whose face is contained in the selectable sub-portion, other images of the person whose face is contained in the selectable sub-portion, and potential image matches for the person's face. In some embodiments, when the sub-portion of the visual query corresponding to a respective visual identifier contains a product for which at least one match (i.e., search result) is found that meets predefined reliability (or other) criteria, the search results corresponding to the respective visual identifier include one or more of: product information, a product review, an option to initiate purchase of the product, an option to initiate a bid on the product, a list of similar products, and a list of related products. [00661 Optionally, a respective user selectable link in the interactive results document includes anchor text, which is displayed in the document without having to activate the link. The anchor text provides information, such as a key word or term, related to the information obtained when the link is activated. Anchor text may be displayed as part of the label (307), or in a portion of a bounding box (304), or as additional information displayed when a user hovers a cursor over a user selectable link for a pre-determined period of time such as 1 second. [00671 Optionally, a respective user selectable link in the interactive results document is a link to a search engine for searching for information or documents corresponding to a text based query (sometimes herein called a term query). Activation of the link causes execution of the search by the search engine, where the query and the search engine are specified by the link (e.g., the search engine is specified by a URL in the link and the text-based search query is 14 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 specified by a URL parameter of the link), with results returned to the client system. Optionally, the link in this example may include anchor text specifying the text or terms in the search query. [00681 In some embodiments, the interactive results document produced in response to a visual query can include a plurality of links that correspond to results from the same search system. For example, a visual query may be an image or picture of a group of people. The interactive results document may include bounding boxes around each person, which when activated returns results from the facial recognition search system for each face in the group. For some visual queries, a plurality of links in the interactive results document corresponds to search results from more than one search system (310). For example, if a picture of a person and a dog was submitted as the visual query, bounding boxes in the interactive results document may outline the person and the dog separately. When the person (in the interactive results document) is selected, search results from the facial recognition search system are retuned, and when the dog (in the interactive results document) is selected, results from the image-to-terms search system are returned. For some visual queries, the interactive results document contains an OCR result and an image match result (312). For example, if a picture of a person standing next to a sign were submitted as a visual query, the interactive results document may include visual identifiers for the person and for the text in the sign. Similarly, if a scan of a magazine was used as the visual query, the interactive results document may include visual identifiers for photographs or trademarks in advertisements on the page as well as a visual identifier for the text of an article also on that page. [00691 After the interactive results document has been created, it is sent to the client system (314). In some embodiments, the interactive results document (e.g., document 1200, Figure 15) is sent in conjunction with a list of search results from one or more parallel search systems, as discussed above with reference to Figure 2. In some embodiments, the interactive results document is displayed at the client system above or otherwise adjacent to a list of search results from one or more parallel search systems (315) as shown in Figure 15. [00701 Optionally, the user will interact with the results document by selecting a visual identifier in the results document. The server system receives from the client system information regarding the user selection of a visual identifier in the interactive results document (316). As discussed above, in some embodiments, the link is activated by selecting an activation region inside a bounding box. In other embodiments, the link is activated by a user selection of a visual identifier of a sub-portion of the visual query, which is not a bounding box. In some embodiments, the linked visual identifier is a hot button, a label located near the sub-portion, an underlined word in text, or other representation of an object or subject in the visual query. 15 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 [0071] In embodiments where the search results list is presented with the interactive results document (315), when the user selects a user selectable link (316), the search result in the search results list corresponding to the selected link is identified. In some embodiments, the cursor will jump or automatically move to the first result corresponding to the selected link. In some embodiments in which the display of the client 102 is too small to display both the interactive results document and the entire search results list, selecting a link in the interactive results document causes the search results list to scroll or jump so as to display at least a first result corresponding to the selected link. In some other embodiments, in response to user selection of a link in the interactive results document, the results list is reordered such that the first result corresponding to the link is displayed at the top of the results list. [00721 In some embodiments, when the user selects the user selectable link (316) the visual query server system sends at least a subset of the results, related to a corresponding sub portion of the visual query, to the client for display to the user (318). In some embodiments, the user can select multiple visual identifiers concurrently and will receive a subset of results for all of the selected visual identifiers at the same time. In other embodiments, search results corresponding to the user selectable links are preloaded onto the client prior to user selection of any of the user selectable links so as to provide search results to the user virtually instantaneously in response to user selection of one or more links in the interactive results document. [00731 Figure 4 is a flow diagram illustrating the communications between a client and a visual query server system. The client 102 receives a visual query from a user/querier (402). In some embodiments, visual queries can only be accepted from users who have signed up for or "opted in" to the visual query system. In some embodiments, searches for facial recognition matches are only performed for users who have signed up for the facial recognition visual query system, while other types of visual queries are performed for anyone regardless of whether they have "opted in" to the facial recognition portion. [00741 As explained above, the format of the visual query can take many forms. The visual query will likely contain one or more subjects located in sub-portions of the visual query document. For some visual queries, the client system 102 performs type recognition pre processing on the visual query (404). In some embodiments, the client system 102 searches for particular recognizable patterns in this pre-processing system. For example, for some visual queries the client may recognize colors. For some visual queries the client may recognize that a particular sub-portion is likely to contain text (because that area is made up of small dark characters surrounded by light space etc.) The client may contain any number of pre-processing 16 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 type recognizers, or type recognition modules. In some embodiments, the client will have a type recognition module (barcode recognition 406) for recognizing bar codes. It may do so by recognizing the distinctive striped pattern in a rectangular area. In some embodiments, the client will have a type recognition module (face detection 408) for recognizing that a particular subject or sub-portion of the visual query is likely to contain a face. [00751 In some embodiments, the recognized "type" is returned to the user for verification. For example, the client system 102 may return a message stating "a bar code has been found in your visual query, are you interested in receiving bar code query results?" In some embodiments, the message may even indicate the sub-portion of the visual query where the type has been found. In some embodiments, this presentation is similar to the interactive results document discussed with reference to Figure 3. For example, it may outline a sub-portion of the visual query and indicate that the sub-portion is likely to contain a face, and ask the user if they are interested in receiving facial recognition results. [00761 After the client 102 performs the optional pre-processing of the visual query, the client sends the visual query to the visual query server system 106, specifically to the front end visual query processing server 110. In some embodiments, if pre-processing produced relevant results, i.e., if one of the type recognition modules produced results above a certain threshold, indicating that the query or a sub-portion of the query is likely to be of a particular type (face, text, barcode etc.), the client will pass along information regarding the results of the pre processing. For example, the client may indicate that the face recognition module is 75% sure that a particular sub-portion of the visual query contains a face. More generally, the pre processing results, if any, include one or more subject type values (e.g., bar code, face, text, etc.). Optionally, the pre-processing results sent to the visual query server system include one or more of: for each subject type value in the pre-processing results, information identifying a sub-portion of the visual query corresponding to the subject type value, and for each subject type value in the pre-processing results, a confidence value indicating a level of confidence in the subject type value and/or the identification of a corresponding sub-portion of the visual query. [00771 The front end server 110 receives the visual query from the client system (202). The visual query received may contain the pre-processing information discussed above. As described above, the front end server sends the visual query to a plurality of parallel search systems (210). If the front end server 110 received pre-processing information regarding the likelihood that a sub-portion contained a subject of a certain type, the front end server may pass this information along to one or more of the parallel search systems. For example, it may pass on the information that a particular sub-portion is likely to be a face so that the facial recognition 17 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 search system I 12-A can process that subsection of the visual query first. Similarly, sending the same information (that a particular sub-portion is likely to be a face) may be used by the other parallel search systems to ignore that sub-portion or analyze other sub-portions first. In some embodiments, the front end server will not pass on the pre-processing information to the parallel search systems, but will instead use this information to augment the way in which it processes the results received from the parallel search systems. [0078] As explained with reference to Figure 2, for at some visual queries, the front end server 110 receives a plurality of search results from the parallel search systems (214). The front end server may then perform a variety of ranking and filtering, and may create an interactive search result document as explained with reference to Figures 2 and 3. If the front end server 110 received pre-processing information regarding the likelihood that a sub-portion contained a subject of a certain type, it may filter and order by giving preference to those results that match the pre-processed recognized subject type. If the user indicated that a particular type of result was requested, the front end server will take the user's requests into account when processing the results. For example, the front end server may filter out all other results if the user only requested bar code information, or the front end server will list all results pertaining to the requested type prior to listing the other results. If an interactive visual query document is returned, the server may pre-search the links associated with the type of result the user indicated interest in, while only providing links for performing related searches for the other subjects indicated in the interactive results document. Then the front end server 110 sends the search results to the client system (226). [00791 The client 102 receives the results from the server system (412). When applicable, these results will include the results that match the type of result found in the pre processing stage. For example, in some embodiments they will include one or more bar code results (414) or one or more facial recognition results (416). If the client's pre-processing modules had indicated that a particular type of result was likely, and that result was found, the found results of that type will be listed prominently. [00801 Optionally the user will select or annotate one or more of the results (418). The user may select one search result, may select a particular type of search result, and/or may select a portion of an interactive results document (420). Selection of a result is implicit feedback that the returned result was relevant to the query. Such feedback information can be utilized in future query processing operations. An annotation provides explicit feedback about the returned result that can also be utilized in future query processing operations. Annotations take the form of 18 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 corrections of portions of the returned result (like a correction to a mis-OCRed word) or a separate annotation (either free form or structured.) [00811 The user's selection of one search result, generally selecting the "correct" result from several of the same type (e.g., choosing the correct result from a facial recognition server), is a process that is referred to as a selection among interpretations. The user's selection of a particular type of search result, generally selecting the result "type" of interest from several different types of returned results (e.g., choosing the OCRed text of an article in a magazine rather than the visual results for the advertisements also on the same page), is a process that is referred to as disambiguation of intent. A user may similarly select particular linked words (such as recognized named entities) in an OCRed document as explained in detail with reference to Figure 8. [00821 The user may alternatively or additionally wish to annotate particular search results. This annotation may be done in freeform style or in a structured format (422). The annotations may be descriptions of the result or may be reviews of the result. For example, they may indicate the name of subject(s) in the result, or they could indicate "this is a good book" or "this product broke within a year of purchase." Another example of an annotation is a user drawn bounding box around a sub-portion of the visual query and user-provided text identifying the object or subject inside the bounding box. User annotations are explained in more detail with reference to Figure 5. [0083] The user selections of search results and other annotations are sent to the server system (424). The front end server 110 receives the selections and annotations and further processes them (426). If the information was a selection of an object, sub-region or term in an interactive results document, further information regarding that selection may be requested, as appropriate. For example, if the selection was of one visual result, more information about that visual result would be requested. If the selection was a word (either from the OCR server or from the Image-to-Terms server) a textual search of that word would be sent to the term query server system 118. If the selection was of a person from a facial image recognition search system, that person's profile would be requested. If the selection was for a particular portion of an interactive search result document, the underlying visual query results would be requested. [00841 If the server system receives an annotation, the annotation is stored in a query and annotation database 116, explained with reference to Figure 5. Then the information from the annotation database 116 is periodically copied to individual annotation databases for one or more of the parallel server systems, as discussed below with reference to Figures 7 - 10. 19 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 [00851 Figure 5 is a block diagram illustrating a client system 102 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The client system 102 typically includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 702, one or more network or other communications interfaces 704, memory 712, and one or more communication buses 714 for interconnecting these components. The client system 102 includes a user interface 705. The user interface 705 includes a display device 706 and optionally includes an input means such as a keyboard, mouse, or other input buttons 708. Alternatively or in addition the display device 706 includes a touch sensitive surface 709, in which case the display 706/709 is a touch sensitive display. In client systems that have a touch sensitive display 706/709, a physical keyboard is optional (e.g., a soft keyboard may be displayed when keyboard entry is needed). Furthermore, some client systems use a microphone and voice recognition to supplement or replace the keyboard. Optionally, the client 102 includes a GPS (global positioning satellite) receiver, or other location detection apparatus 707 for determining the location of the client system 102. In some embodiments, the client 102 also includes one or more of: a magnetometer 742, one or more accelerometers 744, or other sensors 746 for providing location information regarding the client device. In some embodiments, visual query search services are provided that require the client system 102 to provide the visual query server system to receive location information indicating the location of the client system 102. [00861 The client system 102 also includes an image capture device 710 such as a camera or scanner. Memory 712 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and may include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices. Memory 712 may optionally include one or more storage devices remotely located from the CPU(s) 702. Memory 712, or alternately the non-volatile memory device(s) within memory 712, comprises a non-transitory computer readable storage medium. In some embodiments, memory 712 or the computer readable storage medium of memory 712 stores the following programs, modules and data structures, or a subset thereof: * an operating system 716 that includes procedures for handling various basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks; * a network communication module 718 that is used for connecting the client system 102 to other computers via the one or more communication network interfaces 704 (wired or wireless) and one or more communication networks, such as the Internet, other wide area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and so on; 20 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 . a image capture module 720 for processing a respective image captured by the image capture device/camera 710, where the respective image may be sent (e.g., by a client application module) as a visual query to the visual query server system; * one or more client application modules 722 for handling various aspects of querying by image, including but not limited to: a query-by-image submission module 724 for submitting visual queries to the visual query server system; optionally a region of interest selection module 725 that detects a selection (such as a gesture on the touch sensitive display 706/709) of a region of interest in an image and prepares that region of interest as a visual query; a results browser 726 for displaying the results of the visual query; and optionally an annotation module 728 with optional modules for structured annotation text entry 730 such as filling in a form or for freeform annotation text entry 732, which can accept annotations from a variety of formats, and an image region selection module 734 (sometimes referred to herein as a result selection module) which allows a user to select a particular sub-portion of an image for annotation; . an optional content authoring application(s) 736 that allow a user to author a visual query by creating or editing an image rather than just capturing one via the image capture device 710; optionally, one or such applications 736 may include instructions that enable a user to select a sub-portion of an image for use as a visual query; * an optional local image analysis module 738 that pre-processes the visual query before sending it to the visual query server system. The local image analysis may recognize particular types of images, or sub-regions within an image. Examples of image types that may be recognized by such modules 738 include one or more of: facial type (facial image recognized within visual query), bar code type (bar code recognized within visual query), and text type (text recognized within visual query); and * additional optional client applications 740 such as an email application, a phone application, a browser application, a mapping application, instant messaging application, social networking application etc. In some embodiments, the application corresponding to an appropriate actionable search result can be launched or accessed when the actionable search result is selected. [00871 Optionally, the image region selection module 734 which allows a user to select a particular sub-portion of an image for annotation, also allows the user to choose a search result as a "correct" hit without necessarily further annotating it. For example, the user may be presented with a top N number of facial recognition matches and may choose the correct person from that results list. For some search queries, more than one type of result will be presented, and the user 21 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 will choose a type of result. For example, the image query may include a person standing next to a tree, but only the results regarding the person is of interest to the user. Therefore, the image selection module 734 allows the user to indicate which type of image is the "correct" type - i.e., the type he is interested in receiving. The user may also wish to annotate the search result by adding personal comments or descriptive words using either the annotation text entry module 730 (for filling in a form) or freeform annotation text entry module 732. [0088] In some embodiments, the optional local image analysis module 738 is a portion of the client application (108, Fig. 1). Furthermore, in some embodiments the optional local image analysis module 738 includes one or more programs to perform local image analysis to pre-process or categorize the visual query or a portion thereof. For example, the client application 722 may recognize that the image contains a bar code, a face, or text, prior to submitting the visual query to a search engine. In some embodiments, when the local image analysis module 738 detects that the visual query contains a particular type of image, the module asks the user if they are interested in a corresponding type of search result. For example, the local image analysis module 738 may detect a face based on its general characteristics (i.e., without determining which person's face) and provides immediate feedback to the user prior to sending the query on to the visual query server system. It may return a result like, "A face has been detected, are you interested in getting facial recognition matches for this face?" This may save time for the visual query server system (106, Fig. 1). For some visual queries, the front end visual query processing server (110, Fig. 1) only sends the visual query to the search system 112 corresponding to the type of image recognized by the local image analysis module 738. In other embodiments, the visual query to the search system 112 may send the visual query to all of the search systems 1 12A-N, but will rank results from the search system 112 corresponding to the type of image recognized by the local image analysis module 738. In some embodiments, the manner in which local image analysis impacts on operation of the visual query server system depends on the configuration of the client system, or configuration or processing parameters associated with either the user or the client system. Furthermore, the actual content of any particular visual query and the results produced by the local image analysis may cause different visual queries to be handled differently at either or both the client system and the visual query server system. [0089] In some embodiments, bar code recognition is performed in two steps, with analysis of whether the visual query includes a bar code performed on the client system at the local image analysis module 738. Then the visual query is passed to a bar code search system 22 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 only if the client determines the visual query is likely to include a bar code. In other embodiments, the bar code search system processes every visual query. [00901 Optionally, the client system 102 includes additional client applications 740. [00911 Figure 6 is a block diagram illustrating a front end visual query processing server system 110 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The front end server 110 typically includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 802, one or more network or other communications interfaces 804, memory 812, and one or more communication buses 814 for interconnecting these components. Memory 812 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and may include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices. Memory 812 may optionally include one or more storage devices remotely located from the CPU(s) 802. Memory 812, or alternately the non-volatile memory device(s) within memory 812, comprises a non-transitory computer readable storage medium. In some embodiments, memory 812 or the computer readable storage medium of memory 812 stores the following programs, modules and data structures, or a subset thereof: " an operating system 816 that includes procedures for handling various basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks; * a network communication module 818 that is used for connecting the front end server system 110 to other computers via the one or more communication network interfaces 804 (wired or wireless) and one or more communication networks, such as the Internet, other wide area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and so on; " a query manager 820 for handling the incoming visual queries from the client system 102 and sending them to two or more parallel search systems; as described elsewhere in this document, in some special situations a visual query may be directed to just one of the search systems, such as when the visual query includes an client-generated instruction (e.g., "facial recognition search only"); * a results filtering module 822 for optionally filtering the results from the one or more parallel search systems and sending the top or "relevant" results to the client system 102 for presentation; . a results ranking and formatting module 824 for optionally ranking the results from the one or more parallel search systems and for formatting the results for presentation; 23 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 . a results document creation module 826, is used when appropriate, to create an interactive search results document; module 826 may include sub-modules, including but not limited to a bounding box creation module 828 and a link creation module 830; * a label creation module 831 for creating labels that are visual identifiers of respective sub portions of a visual query; * an annotation module 832 for receiving annotations from a user and sending them to an annotation database 116; . an actionable search results module 838 for generating, in response to a visual query, one or more actionable search result elements, each configured to launch a client-side action; examples of actionable search result elements are buttons to initiate a telephone call, to initiate email message, to map an address, to make a restaurant reservation, and to provide an option to purchase a product; and . a local listings selection module 840 for selecting and filtering location search results returned from a location based search system 112G (Figure 24) by various methods explained with reference to Figures 16A-19; " a query and annotation database 116 which comprises the database itself 834 and an index to the database 836. [00921 The results ranking and formatting module 824 ranks the results returned from the one or more parallel search systems (112-A - 112-N, Fig. 1). As already noted above, for some visual queries, only the results from one search system may be relevant. In such an instance, only the relevant search results from that one search system are ranked. For some visual queries, several types of search results may be relevant. In these instances, in some embodiments, the results ranking and formatting module 824 ranks all of the results from the search system having the most relevant result (e.g., the result with the highest relevance score) above the results for the less relevant search systems. In other embodiments, the results ranking and formatting module 824 ranks a top result from each relevant search system above the remaining results. In some embodiments, the results ranking and formatting module 824 ranks the results in accordance with a relevance score computed for each of the search results. For some visual queries, augmented textual queries are performed in addition to the searching on parallel visual search systems. In some embodiments, when textual queries are also performed, their results are presented in a manner visually distinctive from the visual search system results. [00931 The results ranking and formatting module 824 also formats the results. In some embodiments, the results are presented in a list format. In some embodiments, the results are 24 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 presented by means of an interactive results document. Tn some embodiments, both an interactive results document and a list of results are presented. In some embodiments, the type of query dictates how the results are presented. For example, if more than one searchable subject is detected in the visual query, then an interactive results document is produced, while if only one searchable subject is detected the results will be displayed in list format only. [00941 The results document creation module 826 is used to create an interactive search results document. The interactive search results document may have one or more detected and searched subjects. The bounding box creation module 828 creates a bounding box around one or more of the searched subjects. The bounding boxes may be rectangular boxes, or may outline the shape(s) of the subject(s). The link creation module 830 creates links to search results associated with their respective subject in the interactive search results document. In some embodiments, clicking within the bounding box area activates the corresponding link inserted by the link creation module. [00951 The query and annotation database 116 contains information that can be used to improve visual query results. In some embodiments, the user may annotate the image after the visual query results have been presented. Furthermore, in some embodiments the user may annotate the image before sending it to the visual query search system. Pre-annotation may help the visual query processing by focusing the results, or running text based searches on the annotated words in parallel with the visual query searches. In some embodiments, annotated versions of a picture can be made public (e.g., when the user has given permission for publication, for example by designating the image and annotation(s) as not private), so as to be returned as a potential image match hit. For example, if a user takes a picture of a flower and annotates the image by giving detailed genus and species information about that flower, the user may want that image to be presented to anyone who performs a visual query research looking for that flower. In some embodiments, the information from the query and annotation database 116 is periodically pushed to the parallel search systems 112, which incorporate relevant portions of the information (if any) into their respective individual databases 114. [00961 Figure 7 is a block diagram illustrating one of the parallel search systems utilized to process a visual query. Figure 7 illustrates a "generic" server system 112-N in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.

[00991 Figure 10 is a block diagram illustrating an image-to-terms search system 112-C utilized to process a visual query in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In some embodiments, the image-to-terms search system recognizes objects (instance recognition) in the visual query. In other embodiments, the image-to-terms search system recognizes object categories (type recognition) in the visual query. In some embodiments, the image to terms system recognizes both objects and object-categories. The image-to-terms search system returns potential term matches for images in the visual query. The image-to-terms search system 112-C typically includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 1002, one or more network or other communications interfaces 1004, memory 1012, and one or more communication buses 1014 for interconnecting these components. Memory 1012 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and may 29 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices.

[001001 Figures 5-10 are intended more as functional descriptions of the various features which may be present in a set of computer systems than as a structural schematic of the embodiments described herein. In practice, and as recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, items shown separately could be combined and some items could be separated. For example, some items shown separately in these figures could be implemented on single servers and single items could be implemented by one or more servers. The actual number of systems used to 30 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 implement visual query processing and how features are allocated among them will vary from one implementation to another. [00101] Each of the methods described herein may be governed by instructions that are stored in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium and that are executed by one or more processors of one or more servers or clients. The above identified modules or programs (i.e., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus various subsets of these modules may be combined or otherwise re-arranged in various embodiments. Each of the operations shown in Figures 5-10 may correspond to instructions stored in a computer memory or non-transitory computer readable storage medium. [00102] Figure 11 illustrates a client system 102 with a screen shot of an exemplary visual query 1102. The client system 102 shown in Figure 11 is a mobile device such as a cellular telephone, portable music player, or portable emailing device. The client system 102 includes a display 706 and one or more input means 708 such the buttons shown in this figure. In some embodiments, the display 706 is a touch sensitive display 709. In embodiments having a touch sensitive display 709, soft buttons displayed on the display 709 may optionally replace some or all of the electromechanical buttons 708. Touch sensitive displays are also helpful in interacting with the visual query results as explained in more detail below. The client system 102 also includes an image capture mechanism such as a camera 710. [00103] Figure 11 illustrates a visual query 1102 which is a photograph or video frame of a package on a shelf of a store. In the embodiments described here, the visual query is a two dimensional image having a resolution corresponding to the size of the visual query in pixels in each of two dimensions. The visual query 1102 in this example is a two dimensional image of three dimensional objects. The visual query 1102 includes background elements, a product package 1104, and a variety of types of entities on the package including an image of a person 1106, an image of a trademark 1108, an image of a product 1110, and a variety of textual elements 1112. [00104] As explained with reference to Figure 3, the visual query 1102 is sent to the front end server 110, which sends the visual query 1102 to a plurality of parallel search systems (1 12A N), receives the results and creates an interactive results document. [00105] Figures 12A and 12B each illustrate a client system 102 with a screen shot of an embodiment of an interactive results document 1200. The interactive results document 1200 includes one or more visual identifiers 1202 of respective sub-portions of the visual query 1102, which each include a user selectable link to a subset of search results. Figures 12A and 12B illustrate an interactive results document 1200 with visual identifiers that are bounding boxes 31 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 1202 (e.g., bounding boxes 1202-1, 1202-2, 1202-3). Tn the embodiments shown in Figures 12A and 12B, the user activates the display of the search results corresponding to a particular sub portion by tapping on the activation region inside the space outlined by its bounding box 1202. For example, the user would activate the search results corresponding to the image of the person, by tapping on a bounding box 1306 (Figure 13) surrounding the image of the person. In other embodiments, the selectable link is selected using a mouse or keyboard rather than a touch sensitive display. In some embodiments, the first corresponding search result is displayed when a user previews a bounding box 1202 (i.e., when the user single clicks, taps once, or hovers a pointer over the bounding box). The user activates the display of a plurality of corresponding search results when the user selects the bounding box (i.e., when the user double clicks, taps twice, or uses another mechanism to indicate selection.) [00106] In Figures 12A and 12B the visual identifiers are bounding boxes 1202 surrounding sub-portions of the visual query. Figure 12A illustrates bounding boxes 1202 that are square or rectangular. Figure 12B illustrates a bounding box 1202 that outlines the boundary of an identifiable entity in the sub-portion of the visual query, such as the bounding box 1202-3 for a drink bottle. In some embodiments, a respective bounding box 1202 includes smaller bounding boxes 1202 within it. For example, in Figures 12A and 12B, the bounding box identifying the package 1202-1 surrounds the bounding box identifying the trademark 1202-2 and all of the other bounding boxes 1202. In some embodiments that include text, also include active hot links 1204 for some of the textual terms. Figure 12B shows an example where "Active Drink" and "United States" are displayed as hot links 1204. The search results corresponding to these terms are the results received from the term query server system 118, whereas the results corresponding to the bounding boxes are results from the query by image search systems. [00107] Figure 13 illustrates a client system 102 with a screen shot of an interactive results document 1200 that is coded by type of recognized entity in the visual query. The visual query of Figure II contains an image of a person 1106, an image of a trademark 1108, an image of a product 1110, and a variety of textual elements 1112. As such the interactive results document 1200 displayed in Figure 13 includes bounding boxes 1202 around a person 1306, a trademark 1308, a product 1310, and the two textual areas 1312. The bounding boxes of Figure 13 are each presented with separate cross-hatching which represents differently colored transparent bounding boxes 1202. In some embodiments, the visual identifiers of the bounding boxes (and/or labels or other visual identifiers in the interactive results document 1200) are formatted for presentation in visually distinctive manners such as overlay color, overlay pattern, label background color, label background pattern, label font color, and bounding box border color. The type coding for 32 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 particular recognized entities is shown with respect to bounding boxes in Figure 13, but coding by type can also be applied to visual identifiers that are labels. [00108] Figure 14 illustrates a client device 102 with a screen shot of an interactive results document 1200 with labels 1402 being the visual identifiers of respective sub-portions of the visual query 1102 of Figure 11. The label visual identifiers 1402 each include a user selectable link to a subset of corresponding search results. In some embodiments, the selectable link is identified by descriptive text displayed within the area of the label 1402. Some embodiments include a plurality of links within one label 1402. For example, in Figure 14, the label hovering over the image of a woman drinking includes a link to facial recognition results for the woman and a link to image recognition results for that particular picture (e.g., images of other products or advertisements using the same picture.) [00109] In Figure 14, the labels 1402 are displayed as partially transparent areas with text that are located over their respective sub-portions of the interactive results document. In other embodiments, a respective label is positioned near but not located over its respective sub-portion of the interactive results document. In some embodiments, the labels are coded by type in the same manner as discussed with reference to Figure 13. In some embodiments, the user activates the display of the search results corresponding to a particular sub-portion corresponding to a label 1302 by tapping on the activation region inside the space outlined by the edges or periphery of the label 1302. The same previewing and selection functions discussed above with reference to the bounding boxes of Figures 12A and 12B also apply to the visual identifiers that are labels 1402. [00110] Figure 15 illustrates a screen shot of an interactive results document 1200 and the original visual query H 02 displayed concurrently with a results list 1500. In some embodiments, the interactive results document 1200 is displayed by itself as shown in Figures 12-14. In other embodiments, the interactive results document 1200 is displayed concurrently with the original visual query as shown in Figure 15. In some embodiments, the list of visual query results 1500 is concurrently displayed along with the original visual query 1102 and/or the interactive results document 1200. The type of client system and the amount of room on the display 706 may determine whether the list of results 1500 is displayed concurrently with the interactive results document 1200. In some embodiments, the client system 102 receives (in response to a visual query submitted to the visual query server system) both the list of results 1500 and the interactive results document 1200, but only displays the list of results 1500 when the user scrolls below the interactive results document 1200. In some of these embodiments, the client system 102 displays the results corresponding to a user selected visual identifier 1202/1402 without needing to query 33 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 the server again because the list of results 1500 is received by the client system 102 in response to the visual query and then stored locally at the client system 102. [00111] In some embodiments, the list of results 1500 is organized into categories 1502. Each category contains at least one result 1503. In some embodiments, the categories titles are highlighted to distinguish them from the results 1503. The categories 1502 are ordered according to their calculated category weight. In some embodiments, the category weight is a combination of the weights of the highest N results in that category. As such, the category that has likely produced more relevant results is displayed first. In embodiments where more than one category 1502 is returned for the same recognized entity (such as the facial image recognition match and the image match shown in Figure 15) the category displayed first has a higher category weight. [00112] As explained with respect to Figure 3, in some embodiments, when a selectable link in the interactive results document 1200 is selected by a user of the client system 102, the cursor will automatically move to the appropriate category 1502 or to the first result 1503 in that category. Alternatively, when a selectable link in the interactive results document is selected by a user of the client system 102, the list of results 1500 is re-ordered such that the category or categories relevant to the selected link are displayed first. This is accomplished, for example, by either coding the selectable links with information identifying the corresponding search results, or by coding the search results to indicate the corresponding selectable links or to indicate the corresponding result categories. [00113] In some embodiments, the categories of the search results correspond to the query-by-image search system that produce those search results. For example, in Figure 15 some of the categories are product match 1506, logo match 1508, facial recognition match 1510, image match 1512. The original visual query 1102 and/or an interactive results document 1200 may be similarly displayed with a category title such as the query 1504. Similarly, results from any term search performed by the term query server may also be displayed as a separate category, such as web results 1514. In other embodiments, more than one entity in a visual query will produce results from the same query-by-image search system. For example, the visual query could include two different faces that would return separate results from the facial recognition search system. As such, in some embodiments, the categories 1502 are divided by recognized entity rather than by search system. In some embodiments, an image of the recognized entity is displayed in the recognized entity category header 1502 such that the results for that recognized entity are distinguishable from the results for another recognized entity, even though both results are produced by the same query by image search system. For example, in Figure 15, the product match category 1506 includes two entity product entities and as such as two entity categories 34 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 1502 - a boxed product 1516 and a bottled product 1518, each of which have a plurality of corresponding search results 1503. In some embodiments, the categories may be divided by recognized entities and type of query-by-image system. For example, in Figure 15, there are two separate entities that returned relevant results under the product match category product. [00114] In some embodiments, the results 1503 include thumbnail images. For example, as shown for the facial recognition match results in Figure 15, small versions (also called thumbnail images) of the pictures of the facial matches for "Actress X" and "Social Network Friend Y" are displayed along with some textual description such as the name of the person in the image. [00115] Figures 16A - 16C are flow diagrams illustrating a process for using both location sensor data and a visual query to return local listings for the visual query according to some embodiments. Figures 17-19 illustrate various methods of selecting search results identified using the process illustrated in Figures 16A-16C. Each of the operations shown in Figures 16A 19 may correspond to instructions stored in a computer memory or computer readable storage medium. Specifically, many of the operations correspond to executable instructions in the local listings selection module 840 of the front end search system 110 (Figure 6), the search application 2320 of the location-augmented search system 112-F (Figure 23) and the search application 2420 of the location-based search system (Figure 24). [001161 Using location information or enhanced location information to improve visual query searching is useful for "street view visual queries." For example, if a user stands on a street corner and takes a picture of a building as the visual query, and it is processed using current location information (i.e., information identifying the location of the client device) as well as the visual query, the search results will include information about the business(es) or organization(s) located in that building. [00117] As illustrated in Figure 16A, a front end server receives a visual query from a client system (202). The front end server also receives location information (1602). In some embodiments, the location information includes GPS sensor information or cell phone tower information (1604). This location information is typically rough, i.e., it has a relatively low accuracy, and the following description will discuss ways to improve its accuracy. The location information received is likely to pinpoint the user within a specified range. In some embodiments, the location information locates the client system with an accuracy of 75 feet or better; in some other embodiments (as described above) the location information has an accuracy of no worse than A, where A is a predefined value of 100 meters or less. 35 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 [00118] In some embodiments, the location information is computed based on previously received location information (1606). In some embodiments, other sensor information is also received from the client device (1608). The other sensor information may include information from one or more of: a magnetometer 742, an accelerometer 744, or other sensor 746 in the client device 102 (discussed with reference to Figure 5.) In some embodiments, the additional sensor information is used to calculate a rough direction that the user is looking or azimuth, referred to herein as a pose. In some embodiments, the additional sensor information is used to calculate the movement of the user since the time of the visual query using the dead reckoning principle. [00119] The visual query system sends a request for enhanced location information (the request including the visual query and the location information) to at least one visual query search system (1610). As explained with reference to Figure 2, in most embodiments at least the visual query is sent to a plurality of parallel search systems for simultaneous processing. In some embodiments, the visual query search system sends the visual query to a location-augmented search system (112-F shown in Figure 23) (1612). The location-augmented search system performs a visual query match search on a corpus of street view images (previously stored in an image database 2322) within a specified range of the client device's location (as identified by the location information). If the image match is found within this corpus, an associated pinpoint location (2310 shown in Figure 23) identified. In some embodiments, the pinpoint location 2310 also has an accuracy value 2332 which indicates the accuracy of the pinpoint location value. The pinpoint location is used to determine enhanced location information associated with the visual query. Then the enhanced location information is returned to the requesting server (e.g., the front end server) of the visual query system. If no match is found in the corpus of street view images, then no enhanced location information is determined. [00120] In response to the aforementioned request (16 10), the requesting server receives enhanced location information (1614). As described above, the enhanced location information is based on the visual query and the rough location information provided by the client device's sensors. Typically, the enhanced location information has a greater accuracy than the received location information (1616). In some embodiments, the enhanced location information pinpoints the particular location of the user within a narrower range than the original range. In some embodiments, the particular location identified by the enhanced location information is within predefined distance, such as the 10 or 15 feet, from the client device's actual location. Optionally (but typically) the enhanced location information also includes the pose (i.e., the direction that the user is facing) (1618). 36 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 [00121] The visual query system sends a search query to a location-based search system (1 12-G shown in Figure 24) (1620). The location-based search system uses the location data to identify records 2406 in its location database 2422 for local listings that are near the location provided in the search query. If enhanced location information was obtained in response to the provided to the front end server, the search query will include the enhanced location information (1622). Furthermore, if pose information was provided to the front end server, it will also be included in the search query (1624). [00122] Referring to Figure 16B, the location-based search system (112-G shown in Figure 24) sends one or more search results to the front end server (1626). In some embodiments, the search results include one or more results (e.g., local listings) in accordance with enhanced location information (1628). In some embodiments, the search results include one or more results in the direction of the pose (1630). [001231 Optionally, the visual query system (e.g., the front end server) creates an interactive results document comprising a bounding box outlining a respective sub-portion of the visual query and including at least one user selectable link to at least one of the search results (1632). The details of bounding boxes were discussed with respect to Figure 3. Optionally, the bounding box is created by projecting earth coordinates of a search result onto screen coordinates of the visual query (1634). [00124] The visual query system then sends at least one search result to the client system (1636). The search results include local listings. For example, they may include search results for entities such as businesses, organizations, or points of interest near the physical location of the client device. The search results may include only entities visible in the visual query. Alternatively, the search results may include may include entities not visible in the visual query. In some embodiments, a respective search result sent to the client device is located in the direction of the pose (1638). These search results may include both entities that are visible and entities that are not-visible in the visual query. In some embodiments, a respective search result includes a bounding box (1640) that identifies a portion of the visual query corresponding to the respective search result. Figures 17-19 describe embodiments for selecting particular local listings to send to the client system. [00125] In some embodiments, the front end server also sends to the client device, along with the search results, a street view image determined by the visual query system to match the visual query (1642). [00126] Figure 16C includes an optional method for processing a second visual query. The second visual query is received from the client system (1644), typically after the client 37 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 system has been moved from the location of client system when a first (i.e., earlier) visual query from the same client system was processed. Second location information is also received from the client system (1646). The visual query system (e.g., the front end server of the visual query system) sends a request to the visual query search system (specifically the location-augmented search system 112-F - Figure 23) requesting second enhanced location information based on the second visual query and the second location information (1648). [00127] When the request for second enhanced location information is successful, resulting in receipt of second enhanced location information having greater accuracy than the second location information received from the client system, the visual query system sends a second search query to a location-based search system (1 12-G, Figure 24), which includes the second enhanced location information (1650). One or more search results in accordance with the second search query are then received (1652), and at least one search result in accordance with the second search query is sent to the client system (1654). [00128] When the request for second enhanced location information is not successful, the visual query system sends a third search query to the location based search system, which includes the enhanced location information from the first query (1656). In this embodiment, the original enhanced location information is preferred over the second location information received from the client because the original enhanced location probably more accurately pinpoints the location of the client device than the rough location information provided by the client device. In some embodiments, the user may not have moved at all since the time of the original query. He may have only rotated. As long as the client device's speed of movement and/or the amount of time that has elapsed since the first visual query was received from the client device do not exceed predefined limits, the original pinpoint location of the client device remains relatively accurate. In this embodiment, one or more search results in accordance with the third search query are then received (1658), and at least one search result in accordance with the second search query is sent to the client system (1660). [00129] Figure 17 is a flow diagram illustrating a frustum method of selecting search results. In this method, a visual query is received from a client device (202) and a plurality of initial search results (e.g., local listings) are received (1701), for example the systems and methods discussed above. The initial search results are then filtered using a viewing frustum, as discussed next. [00130] A viewing frustum is a model of the client device's field of view. In some embodiments, the frustum is constructed based on the location of the client device and the pose information (1702). In some embodiments, the pose information is provided (see 1618) as a part 38 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 of the enhanced location information. In embodiments where the pose information was not determined by the location-augmented search system, a rough pose can sometimes be determined based on information provided from a client device sensor such as a magnetometer (742 of Figure 5) (1704). [00131] The frustum has a length L which is a certain defined distance from the location of the client device. In some embodiments, the length of the frustum is a function of the accuracy of the location information. If the enhanced location information is highly accurate, then the length of the frustum is within a "short range." In some embodiments, this short range is less than 100 yards. If the enhanced location is not accurate, or if the enhanced location information was not found, the length of the frustum is within a "large range" relative to the short range. In some embodiments, this large range is more than the short range and less than 500 yards. [00132] In some embodiments, the viewing frustum is also constructed based the current orientation of the device (1706). In some embodiments, the orientation is determined based on an asymmetrical aspect ratio of the visual query (1708). Users typically hold an asymmetrical device, a device whose width and height are not the same length, in one of two orientations: portrait or landscape. In some embodiments, the orientation of the device is determined sensor information from a client device sensor (e.g., information from accelerometers in the client device) (1710). [001331 Once the viewing frustum is constructed, it is used to test whether or not a search result is within the field of view of the client device. If a search result location is within the frustum, it is considered to be in the field of view of the client device (also called being "in view of the client device"). If a search result is not within the frustum, it is not considered to be in view of the client device. In some embodiments, when a plurality of search results is received, the search results are filtered to exclude search results outside of the viewing frustum (also called "outside the field of view of the client device") (1712). As long as there are any search results remaining, at least one search result within the viewing frustum is sent to the client system (1714) as a response to the visual query. [00134] Figure 18 is a flow diagram illustrating a method of selecting search results based on prominence and location data. An accuracy value for the enhanced location information is identified (1802). This accuracy value is identified at least in part based on the accuracy value 2332 for the pinpoint location 23 10 of the street view record 2306 in the image database 2322 of the location-augmented search system 112-F (references from Figure 23) identified as matching the visual query and the location information provided to the location-augmented search system. 39 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 In some embodiments, the accuracy value is a numeric value that indicates accuracy. Tn one example, the accuracy value indicates an estimated or maximum inaccuracy as measured in predefined units (e.g., meters or feet). Lower accuracy values in this example indicate greater accuracy. Thus, an accuracy value of " 10" would indicate an estimated accuracy of 10 meters, while a value of "50" indicates an estimated accuracy of 50 meters. In another example, the accuracy value may indicate one of two or more predefined levels. For example, a system could have four predefined distinct accuracy levels, I to 4, or A to D. Any suitable designations of the levels could be used. [00135] A prominence value for a respective search result is also identified (1804). The prominence value is a relative determination of the importance of a search result. For example, famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower have high prominence values. In another example, restaurants with high ratings (by customers, or critics, or both) are assigned higher prominence values than restaurants with relatively low ratings. The prominence value 2436 is associated with a respective record 2410 in the location database 2422 of the location-based search system 112-G (references from Figure 24) returned as a search result from the location-based search system. [00136] An associated position of a respective search result is also identified (1806). In some embodiments, the position is physical location of an entity (e.g., building, business, landmark, etc.), as determined by the location information 2410 in a respective record 2406 in the location database 2422 of the location-based search system 112-G (Figure 24), returned as a search result from the location-based search system. In some embodiments, the location information 2410 is a pair of latitude and longitude values. In some embodiments, the location information also provides information regarding a point closest to the entity's front door and a point closest to the street. The way the entity faces can then be determined by forming a vector between the two points. In some embodiments, the position is the postal address 2434 of the entity, which is likewise associated with a respective record 2406 in the location database 2422 of the location-based search system 112-G (references from Figure 24) returned as a search result from the location-based search system. [00137] The server performing the method illustrated in Figure 18 determines the distance between the enhanced location (of the client device) and the associated position of a respective search result (1808). [00138] Then the server determines favored search results in accordance with the accuracy value of the enhanced location (1810). When enhanced location information for the client device is accurate (has a high accuracy value), nearby listings are preferred over prominent listings that 40 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 are less close to the client device for inclusion in the search results. More specifically, the server favors search results near the enhanced location when the enhanced location has an accuracy value at or above a threshold (1812). In some embodiments, when enhanced location information for the client device is accurate, a first set of weighting factors that favor listings (i.e., search results) based on close location as opposed to prominence are used. For example, for accurate enhanced location information a weighting factor of 0.8 is multiplied by a closeness metric (which corresponds to how close a search result's location is to the client device's location) and a weighting factor of 0.2 is multiplied by the prominence value of the search result. In some embodiments, a variable radius of relevant search results is used. A large radius is used when the location information for the client device has low accuracy (an accuracy value below a threshold) and a small radius is used when the location information for the client device has high accuracy (an accuracy value above a threshold). [00139] Similarly, when the client device location is not accurate, prominent local listings are favored over listings calculated to be closest to the client device by using a second set of weighting factors. This is because listings calculated to be closest may not actually be close at all due to the inaccuracy of the client device location value. The visual query system favors search results with a high prominence value when the enhanced location is not available or has an accuracy value below the threshold (1814). When enhanced location information for the client device has a low accuracy, a second set of weighting factors that favor listings based on prominence as opposed to location are used. For example, when the enhanced location information is below a threshold, a weighting factor of 0.2 is multiplied by a closeness metric (which corresponds to how close a search result's location is to the client device's location) and a weighting factor of 0.8 is multiplied by the prominence value of the search result. Finally, at least one favored search result is sent to the client system (1816). [00140] Figure 19 is a flow diagram illustrating a method of selecting search results based on relative position and accuracy data. An associated position of a respective search result is also identified (1806). As discussed with reference to Figure 18, in some embodiments, the associated position is (physical) location information 2410 and in other embodiments it is the postal address information 2434 associated with a respective record 2410 in the location database 2422 of the location-based search system 1 12-G (references from Figure 24) returned as a search result from the location-based search system. [00141] Similarly, a positional accuracy associated with a respective search result is also identified (1904). The positional accuracy is the accuracy of location 2432 associated with a respective record 2410 in the location database 2422 of the location-based search system 112-G 41 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 (references from Figure 24), returned as a search result from the location-based search system. Tn some embodiments, the visual query system selects one or more search results having highest associated positional accuracy (1906). [00142] The server performing the method illustrated in Figure 19 determines a positional closeness value (sometimes called a closeness metric) between a respective search result position and the enhanced location information for the client system (1908). In some embodiments, the server selects one or more first search results whose positional closeness value satisfies a positional closeness requirement (1910). In some embodiments, the positional closeness requirement is an absolute value, such as 100 yards. In other embodiments the positional closeness requirement varies depending on the accuracy of the enhanced location as discussed with relation to Figure 18. In some embodiments, the server selects one or more first search results that also have a positional accuracy that is equal to or greater than a threshold (1912). 1001431 In some embodiments, the server selects one or more second search results in accordance with a requirement that each identified second search result satisfy a second positional closeness requirement with respect to at least one of the first search results (1914). In other words, when the candidate search results include local listings having accurate information and others with less accurate location (sometimes herein called inaccurate locations), the final search results include only A) local listings with accurate location information that are near the device's location, and B) those local listing having inaccurate information that are known to be near the accurately located local listings in (A). In some embodiments, the inaccurately located listings are known to be near the accurately located listing by some other means, such as postal address, street name, or by clustering locations. [00144] In some embodiments, the server excludes from the selected search results those search results that have a positional accuracy less than a threshold (1916). This threshold value is analogous to that discussed above. In some embodiments, the server excludes one or more search results that also do not satisfy a positional closeness requirement with respect to at least one of the selected search results that has positional accuracy equal to or greater than the threshold and that satisfies a first positional closeness requirement with respect to the enhanced location information for the client system (1918). [00145] Finally, at least one selected search result is sent to the client system (1920). [00146] It should be noted that, as discussed above in relation to Figures 16A-19, in embodiments when the request for enhanced location information is successful, resulting in 42 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 receipt of enhanced location information having greater accuracy than the location information received from the client system, the visual query system sends a first search query to a location based search system. The search query includes the enhanced location information. The visual query system then receives one or more search results in accordance with the first search query. However, when the request for enhanced location information is not successful, the visual query system sends a second search query to the location-based search system. The second search query includes the received location information from the client system. Then the visual query system receives one or more search results in accordance with the second search query, and culls them in various ways as discussed above before sending at least one of the search results to the client system. [00147] Figure 20 is a flow diagram illustrating the communications between a client system 102 and a visual query system (e.g., front end visual query server system 110 of a visual query system) for creating actionable search results 1700 with location information. In some embodiments, the location information is enhanced prior to being used. In these embodiments, visual query results are based at least in part on the location of the user at the time of the querying. [00148] Each of the operations shown in Figure 20 may correspond to instructions stored in a computer memory or computer readable storage medium. Specifically, many of the operations correspond to executable instructions in the local listings selection module 840 of the front end search system 110 (Figure 6). [00149] The client device or system 102 receives an image from the user (2002). In some embodiments, the image is received from a camera 710 (Figure 5) in the client device or system 102. The client system also receives location information (2004) indicating the location of the client system. The location information may come from a GPS device 707 (Figure 5) in the client device or system 102. Alternately, or in addition, the location information may come from cell tower usage information or local wireless network information. In order to be useful for producing street-view-assisted results, the location information typically must satisfy an accuracy criterion. In some embodiments, when the location information has an accuracy of no worse than A, where A is a predefined value of 100 meters or less, the accuracy criterion is satisfied. The client system 102 creates a visual query from the image (2006) and sends the visual query to the server system (2008). In some embodiments, the client system 102 also sends the location information to the server (2010). 43 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 [00150] The front end server system 110 receives the visual query (2012) from the client system. It also receives location information (2014). The front end server system 110 sends the visual query to at least one search system implementing a visual query process (2016). In some embodiments, the visual query is sent to a plurality of parallel search systems. The search systems return one or more search results (2024). The front end server system sends the location information to at least one location augmented search system (2018). The location information received (at 2014) is likely to pinpoint the user within a specified range. In some embodiments, the location information locates the client system with an accuracy of 75 feet or better; in some other embodiments (as described above) the location information has an accuracy of no worse than A, where A is a predefined value of 100 meters or less. [00151] The location-augmented search system (112-F shown in Figure 23) performs a visual query match search on a corpus of street view images (previously stored in an image database 2322) within the specified range. If the image match is found within this corpus, enhanced location information associated with the matching image is retrieved. In some embodiments, the enhanced location information pinpoints the particular location of the user within a narrower range than the original range and optionally (but typically) also includes the pose (i.e., the direction that the user is facing.) In some embodiments, the particular location identified by the enhanced location information is within predefined distance, such as the 10 or 15 feet, from the client device's actual location. In this embodiment, the front end server system 110 receives the enhanced location information based on the visual query and the location information from the location augmented search system (2020). Then the front end server system 110 sends the enhanced location information to a location-based query system (1 12-G shown in Figure 24) (2022). The location-based query system 112-G retrieves and returns one or more search results, which are received by the front end server system (2024). Optionally, the search results are obtained in accordance with both the visual query and the enhanced location information (2026). Alternately, the search results are obtained in accordance with the enhanced location information, which was retrieved using the original location information and the visual query (2028). [00152] It should be noted that the visual query results (received at 2024) may include results for entities near the pinpointed location, whether or not these entities are viewable in the visual query image. For example, the visual query results may include entities obstructed in the original visual query (e.g., by a passing car or a tree.) In some embodiments, the visual query results will also include nearby entities such as businesses or landmarks near the pinpointed address even if these entities are not in the visual query image at all. 44 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 [00153] The front end server system 110 sends one or more search results to the client system (2030). As explained with reference to Figures 16A-19, there are numerous methods used to determine which search results should be sent. The client system 102 receives the one or more search results (2032). Then the client system displays the one or more search results (2034). [00154] Figure 21 illustrates a client system display of an embodiment of a results list 1500 and returned for a visual query 1200 of a building. The visual query 1200 in this embodiment was processed as a street view visual query, and thus the received search results were obtained in accordance with both the visual query and location information provided by the client system 102. The visual query in this embodiment was taken in portrait mode. The identified entity for this query is the San Francisco (SF) Ferry building 210 1. A thumbnail 2102 of the street view image for the San Francisco Ferry building is provided along with the search results. In the embodiment shown in Figure 21, the "place match" visual query search result information 2104 is displayed. The place match result includes the name of the building (SF Ferry Building), the postal address (Pier 48), a description about the place, and a star rating. Some of this information was obtained from the associated information 2408 of this record in the location-based search system II 2-G (Figure 24). Some of this information was obtained based on other searches performed by other visual query search systems 112-A - 1 12-N and the term query server system 118 [00155] The search results list includes web results 1514 and related place matches 2110. The search results list includes other places identified by the street view place match system. In some embodiments, the place match system displays other similar and/or other nearby places to the one identified as currently being in front of the user. For example, if the place in front of the user were identified as a Thai restaurant, the street view place match system may display other Thai restaurants within one mile of the identified place. [00156] In the embodiment shown in Figure 21 the displayed related places 2110 are places that are also popular tourist stops - the California Academy of Sciences 2112 and the Palace of Fine Arts 2114. These place matches have high prominence values. In this embodiment these high prominence results are displayed rather than results near the SF Ferry Building. In other words results with high prominence values were favored over results near the enhanced location. This is probably due to the fact that an accuracy value for the enhanced location information did not reach a threshold, i.e., the enhanced location information had a low accuracy value. If the accuracy value had reached a threshold, rather than displaying results with high prominence values, the results displayed would be places geographically next to the identified place, such as the stores on either side or above the store in the visual query. 45 WO 2011/068574 PCT/US2010/045631 [00157] Figure 22 illustrates a client system display of an embodiment where a plurality of actionable search result elements 1700 overlay the visual query 1200. In this embodiment the actionable search result elements which are returned are for a street view visual query. Actionable search results are explained in detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/266,133, filed December 2, 2009, entitled "Actionable Search Results for Street View Visual Queries," which application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. [00158] In the embodiment shown in Figure 22, the front end server system received enhanced location information with a high accuracy value. As such, only the closest entity to the enhanced location was provided as a search result. The location-based search system identified a restaurant entity called "The City Restaurant" 2201 with a high enough confidence that it was the only result returned. Then a variety of additional information about this restaurant entity is provided. The front end server identified several client side actions corresponding to "The City Restaurant" entity 2201 and created actionable search result elements for them. The actionable search result elements include a button 2204 to call a phone number associated with the restaurant, a button 2206 to read reviews regarding the restaurant, a button 2208 to get information regarding the restaurant, a button 22 10 for mapping the address associated with the restaurant, a button 2212 for making reservations at the restaurant, and a button 2214 for more information such as nearby or similar restaurants.
