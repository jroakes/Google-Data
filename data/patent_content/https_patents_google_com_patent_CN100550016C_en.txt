Cut apart the processing of assembly
Fig. 4 is the process flow diagram that illustrates the typical operation that meets each side of the present invention that is used to cut apart the document with local correlations.Usually, cut apart assembly 230 and can cut apart document based on the visual layout of document.
Cut apart assembly 230 and can discern the candidate documents (action 401) that is used to cut apart.Candidate documents can be to be identified a document with one or more geographic signal relevant with business.Geographic signal can comprise the information with the ground spot correlation, such as the address of the complete of this place or part, telephone number complete or part and/or with the complete or title of part of the enterprise of this ground spot correlation.For example, be arranged in the counting of document speech where or character by each geographic signal of storage representation, the position of geographic signal in document can be stored in the database 235.
Can discern the business in (action 402) document based on geographic signal.For example, when geographical signal definition can have been determined sufficient address and enterprise name, just can discern a business.In certain embodiments, Yellow Page data or other business directories that generates in advance can be used to check enterprise name/address of being discerned.
Fig. 5 is the synoptic diagram that illustrates the part of example document 500.Example document 500 is the html web page documents in a plurality of restaurants of comment.As shown in the figure, document 500 can comprise the comment 530-1 to 530-4 in Document Title 510, class label 520-1 and 520-2 and each restaurant.As can be seen, document 500 comprises four business, comment 530-1 each in the 530-4 with wherein one be associated.To index the document the time, wish each comment business corresponding with it be associated rather than be associated with any other business in the document 500.In addition, heading message can comprise having such as Document Title 510 and class label 520 benefiting the useful descriptor that is associated with business.
At document 500 is under the situation of webpage, can use the SGML such as HTML to generate document 500.The specific html element that is used to design different web pages is plain very different with style.Though HTML is based on the DOM Document Object Model (DOM) of hierarchical structure, the hierarchical structure of DOM is not necessarily represented the visual layout or visual the cutting apart of document.
Cut apart the visual model (action 403) that assembly 230 can generate candidate documents.This visual model may be special based on visual gaps in the document or decollator, such as white space.In the environment of HTML, for example, different html element elements may be endowed different weight (numerical value), attempts to quantize the size of the visual gaps introduced in the made document.In one embodiment, bigger weight can be represented bigger visual gaps.Can adopt multiple mode to determine weight.For example, can usually determine weight to find out the html element that tends to the visual separation document by a plurality of html documents of subjective analysis.Based on this subjective analysis, can at first give and revise (" adjustment ") weight then till document is cut apart acceptably.Also can use the other technologies that generate suitable weight, such as based on to the inspection of the source code of web browser software or behavior or make the corpus of marking of the webpage of cutting apart by hand weight is set automatically by the machine learning process.
As the example of giving weight, consider html element element＜hr〉(horizontal line).＜hr〉element can be in this element front and back introducing weight 20.As another example, html element element＜h1〉to＜h6 be used to begin new title, wherein＜h1 most important and＜h6 least important.Corresponding element＜/h1〉to＜/h6〉be used to finish these titles.Various titles can for example be endowed weight, such as for element＜h2 〉, before this element weight be 50 and be 30 in weight thereafter (that is, can give＜h2〉weight 50 and giving＜/h2 weight 30).This reflects such notion, promptly with in the content of its front compares, and title text more likely is associated with the content of its back.
Fig. 6 is the synoptic diagram of the visual model of conceptual illustration explanation document 500.Visual model 600 comprises many text element 610-1 to 610-7, and they are corresponding respectively with the text element shown in Fig. 5 (Document Title 510, class label 520-1, comment 530-1 and 530-2, class label 520-2 and comment 530-3 and 530-4).At text element 620-1 to the 620-1 that assigns weight between the 620-6 to 620-6.Corresponding business shown in the circle presentation graphs 5 shown in text element 610-3,610-4,610-6 and the 610-7.
For typical visual model 600, suppose that text 610-2 and 610-5 are implemented as＜h2〉the html element element, it is corresponding to the weighted value 30 of weight 620-2 and 620-5 and the weighted value 60 of weight 620-4 (50 come from text 610-5 and 10 come from text 610-4).Can calculate weight 620-1 by the summation of weight relevant with text 610-2 (50) and the weight of being correlated with the Document Title among the text 610-1, its value is 90.Can use for example a plurality of HTML＜br〉(line feed) element or realize the text 610-1 of Document Title as the HTML title element, wherein this title element for example is the weighted value of the total value contribution 40 of weight 620-1.Weight 620-3 and 620-6 for example can be based on after each document comment 530＜br〉element (that is, text 610-3,610-4,610-6 and 610-7).
Get back to Fig. 4, can determine the hierarchical structure (action 404) of document based on visual model.In one embodiment, different weights can define different levels, the level that wherein bigger weight definition is higher.Minimum level can be confirmed as minimum weight, and the text element that contains geographic signal in lowest hierarchical level obtains distinguishing.
Fig. 7 is the synoptic diagram of visual model 600 that illustrates the hierarchical structure of document 500.Bracket is used to represent the level zone.In this example, weight 620-1 is a maximum weight and near the top of document, therefore can represent that document 610-1 is document title or title (level 710).In next level (level 720), weight 620-1 and 620-4 have defined two zones, and wherein each all has three text fragments.In this level (level 730), weight 620-2 and 620-5 have separated these fragments.At last, weight 620-3 and 620-6 have separated text fragments 610-3 and 610-4, and text fragments 610-6 and 610-7 (level 740).These text fragments comprise geographic signal.
Based on determined level in the process 404, the each several part of document can be associated with the business in the document (process 405).Can be associated with this business in one embodiment, with around the relevant text of the minimum level of business.In addition, the text of not relevant with another business higher levels can be associated with this business.In the example of Fig. 5 and 6, for example, text 530-2/610-4 outside being associated with text " Chinese " and title " Top Restaurants in Fairfax, VA. ", also can with restaurant " Noodles﹠amp; Co., business " is associated.
The content of determining for every business can be associated with the suitable business in the database 235 (action 406).Business and its related content can be used as single combination document and come index.In interchangeable embodiment, business and its corresponding contents can be by the difference index, and still the special field that can pass through in the index is interrelated.In the example of Fig. 5-7, for example, " Hunan Eatery, 4008University Drive, Fairfax, VA, " business can be associated with comment text 530-1, class label 520-1 and title 510.
Though the cutting procedure of describing with reference to Fig. 4-7 is described to cut apart document based on the geographic signal corresponding to business, general level cutting techniques can more generally be applied to the signal of any kind in the document.For example, can use the image (picture signal) in the document, and not use and business corresponding geographical signal.Then can by cutting procedure should be used for determine which text is relevant with which image.As selection, under situation not, can on document, carry out with reference to the cutting procedures that action 403 and 404 is described based on the division of signal document.Then, the stratification segmentation that is identified can be used to guide the sorter of identification document each several part, these parts more or less relevant with document (for example, the navigation boilerplate is more uncorrelated than the centre point of the page usually).
The search example
Fig. 8 and 9 is the graphical representation of exemplary according to the user interface that can present to the user of the embodiment of principle according to the invention.The interface that is associated with local search engine of having supposed user capture is such as search engine 225 (Fig. 2).As shown in Figure 8, the user can be by one or more search terms of search column 810 inputted searches inquiry.In addition, the user can import interested geographic area in search column 820.In this example, the user has imported search inquiry " Chinese restaurants whole wheat noodles " and has indicated this search carrying out in the zone with " Fairfax, VA " corresponding geographical.
Carry out search in the corpus of documents of index in advance that search engine 225 can be in being stored in database 235.Index can be to have used technology discussed above to generate, and like this, the business of Chinese-style restaurant may be also be associated with the additional information that helps to classify more fully and/or describe business.In this case, search engine 225 may can find at Fairfax the Chinese-style restaurant that the whole wheat noodles are provided of VA.
As shown in Figure 9, by user interface, search engine 225 can present Local Search result 910.For each Search Results 910 (or certain subclass of Search Results), user interface can provide the segment of the telephone number of the address information that is associated with Search Results or mentions the enterprise of this Search Results, this enterprise, the document relevant with this enterprise, with this enterprise the linking of relevant more information, to the linking of one or more documents that links and/or relate to this enterprise of the road information of this enterprise.User interface can also provide the map of this search institute overlay area.As shown in the figure, first Search Results 910 comprises enterprise name and phone information 915, address information 920, describe the document of this enterprise segment 930 of (here, the document can be associated with this enterprise or be unconnected), the document that is associated with segment 930 link 940 and relate to this enterprise attached document link 950.
