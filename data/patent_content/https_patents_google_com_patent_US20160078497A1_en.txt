Definitions
- the present specification relates to information presentation.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided while providing the resources. For example, when a person performs an online search, content for businesses relating to the online search can also be presented to the user. Because the content is for businesses relating to the person's search, the person will presumably be interested in the content.
- content e.g., advertisements
- Selection and presentation of content can affect a user's level of interest. If content is selected at random, a user will most likely be less interested than if content is selected for a particular user. As such, many advertisers seek to focus their advertisements toward specific users and may be willing to pay more to have their advertisements shown to those specific users.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in processes that include setting allocations and prices in auctions.
- the process includes receiving a request for content for presentation in association with one or more presentation opportunities on a publisher site.
- the process further includes determining one or more eligible content items based on the received request.
- the process also includes, determining bids associated with each eligible content item, determining a historical bid distribution for bids that have been identified when selecting content for presentation on the publisher site, determining a risk adjustment parameter that reflects a measure of confidence in the accuracy of the historical bid distribution, conducting an auction including scoring the determined eligible content items based on the historical bid distribution, their respective bids, and the risk adjustment parameter, selecting a winning content item from the eligible content items based on the auction, setting a price for the winning content item, and providing the winning content item in response to the request.
- selecting the winning content item comprises selecting a highest bid. In some implementations, selecting the winning content item comprises selecting between at least two highest bids.
- determining the historical bid distribution for bids that have been identified when selecting content for presentation on the publisher site comprises determining a cumulative distribution function for the publisher site. Determining the historical bid distribution for bids that have been identified when selecting content for presentation on the publisher site may further comprise determining a probability density function using the cumulative distribution function for the publisher site. In some implementations, the risk adjustment parameter is a function of an amount of historical bid data available for the publisher site.
- scoring the determined eligible content items based on the historical bid distribution, their respective bids, and the risk adjustment parameter includes, for each bid associated with a particular eligible content item, calculating a risk-adjusted virtual valuation based on the historical bid distribution, the particular bid, and the risk adjustment parameter.
- scoring the determined eligible content items further includes generating risk-adjusted virtual valuations as a function of the bids.
- scoring the determined eligible content items further includes generating an ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation as a function of the bids.
- the ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation is a non-decreasing function of the bids.
- selecting the winning content item includes ranking the eligible content items based on their corresponding ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuations.
- setting the price for the winning content item includes selecting the price at a bottom range associated with the one or more entities that are specifically interested in the one or more content presentation opportunities. In some implementations, setting the price for the winning content item includes computing an average of a set of highest bids.
- a method includes receiving a request for content for presentation association with one or more presentation opportunities on a publisher site, determining one or more eligible content items based on the received request, determining bids associated with each eligible content item, determining a cumulative distribution function corresponding to a distribution of bids that a plurality of advertisers have previously placed for a publisher site, determining a risk adjustment parameter that reflects a measure of confidence in the accuracy of the historical bid distribution, for each bid, calculating a risk-adjusted virtual valuation based on each respective bid, the cumulative distribution function, and the risk adjustment parameter, ranking the bids based on the calculated risk-adjusted virtual valuations and selecting a winning bid based on the ranking, setting a price for the winning bid, and providing the winning content item in response to the request.
- the risk adjustment parameter is a function of an amount of historical bid data available for the publisher site.
- the process further comprises determining a probability density function corresponding to the cumulative distribution function, wherein the calculation of the risk-adjusted virtual valuation is further based on the probability density function.
- the process further comprises determining an ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation that comprises a non-decreasing function.
- selecting the winning bid includes selecting a non-highest bid as the winning bid.
- setting the price for the winning content item includes computing an average of a set of highest bids.
- a system comprises one or more computer processors and one or more non-transitory computer readable devices that include instructions that, when executed by the one or more computer processors, causes the processors to perform processes described herein.

- FIG. 6 is a conceptual diagram of a system that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document.
- This document describes systems and techniques for setting allocations and prices for content in an auction.
- an advertiser may desire to show an advertisement to a user who has previously visited the advertiser's website.
- the term “remarketing,” as it is used herein, refers to presenting content (e.g., an advertisement) to a user who has previously visited the content provider's website, domain, or otherwise interacted with content, an application or resource of a content provider.
- the content provider may recognize the previous visit, for example, through the use of cookies, tokens or other identifiers. In these instances, the remarketing content provider may be willing to bid significantly higher than other non-remarketing content providers for a given impression.
- a remarketing content provider may be willing to pay five times as much as the next highest non-remarketing content provider, but because of the use of a second price auction, the remarketing content provider only pays the publisher (in this example) about 20% of what he was willing to pay.
- the methods described herein determine information about the expected distribution of bids for a particular publisher, calculate corresponding probabilities, and compute risk-adjusted virtual valuation for each content provider in the auction. Based on these calculations, auction ranking and pricing is determined, as described herein.
- the selection of a winning bidder may include a randomized mechanism. For example, if two highest ranked content providers each place bids in a middle range (e.g., where one of the content providers is a remarketer who has lowered his bid and one is not a remarketer), then the system introduces a randomized mechanism for values in that middle range. That is, if the two highest ranked content providers are treated as if they both have the highest bid, then each content provider has a 50% chance of winning the auction, even if the remarketing content provider had a slightly higher bid than the non-remarketing content provider. Ultimately, introducing the randomized mechanism deters remarketing content providers from lowering their bids because there is a chance that remarketing content providers' bids will be randomized and they will not win the auction.
- a flow chart shows a method 100 for setting allocations and prices in auctions in response to a request for content.
- a computing device receives a request for content, such as for presentation in one or more slots on a publisher site. This may be, for example, in a situation where a web page is to be presented to a user, and the web page includes a slot for one or more content items.
- the slot can be filled by submitting a request for content for presentation on the publisher site.
- the request may be sent to an advertising server or other content management system.
- the content may be in the form of an advertisement, such as a web banner, a pop-up ad, a video ad, an audio ad, or the like.
- the advertisement may alternatively be a keyword ad or a search ad. Other forms of sponsored content are possible.
- the computing device determines one or more eligible content items based on the received request.
- the one or more eligible content items may be in the form of advertisements.
- the eligible content items can be in inventory and sourced by various content providers who may be, for example, advertisers hoping to attract customers to their web sites.
- the computing device determines bids associated with each eligible content item.
- the content providers that provide the one or more eligible content items submit their respective content items with a bid associated with the content item.
- the bid is somewhat reflective of the value that the particular content provider places on the particular slot.
- a remarketing content provider e.g., advertiser
- a remarketing content provider knows that the slot is located on a web page that will be displayed to a user on the content provider's customer list (e.g., a list of users who have previously visited the content provider's web site)
- that content provider would likely place a higher value on the particular slot that a different content provider who has had no prior interactions with the user.
- an advertiser determines than an advertising opportunity is available to present content to a user on the customer list, that advertiser would likely be willing to pay more than a non-remarketing advertiser because of the higher probability that the user will be interested in the advertiser and generate a conversion.
- the computing device determines a historical bid distribution for bids that have been identified when selecting content for presentation on the publisher site.
- Various methods can be used to determine the historical bid distribution.
- the paper, “Optimal Auctions” by Roger Myerson (published in Mathematics of Operations Research in 1981) developed a theoretically optimal way to conduct an auction for a single content presentation opportunity when one knows the exact distribution from which bidder values are drawn. While this is a useful benchmark, the methods described herein instead focus on how to best conduct an auction where one's measure of the distribution from which bidder values are drawn is imprecise and simply applying the Myerson (1981) framework could lead to significant revenue loss if the measure of this distribution is too imprecise.
- a cumulative distribution function is measured, which corresponds to the distribution of the effective cost per thousand impressions (eCPM) bids that content providers have placed on a given publisher web site.
- a CDF reflects the range of bids that content providers have historically made on a particular publisher web site and how frequently content providers have placed bids of each value.
- the CDF is used to compute a probability density function for the CDF. Because the calculated distributions are estimates, the distributions may not be exact.
- a parameter that represents a risk adjustment is used that indicates an extent to which one wishes to be cautious in trying to charge content providers higher prices when there is a risk that mismeasuring the distributions could cause revenue loss.
- This risk adjustment parameter, ⁇ reflects how much the system will adjust a virtual valuation of a presentation opportunity (e.g., an ad slot) in response to calculated distributions.
- Risk adjustment parameter, ⁇ may normalized and be described in the interval [0,1]. If there is high confidence in the calculated distribution, then the risk is determined to be low, so ⁇ is set closer to 0. If there is low confidence in the calculated distribution, then the risk is determined to be high, so ⁇ is set closer to 1.
- the risk adjustment factor may be reflective of an amount of historical bid data that is available for a particular publisher. If a lot of historical bid data is available, there is higher confidence in the calculated distribution than if not much historical bid data is available.
- the risk adjustment may also reflect a level of accuracy in the estimated distributions of bids.
- each calculated risk-adjusted virtual valuation is a function of a particular content provider's eCPM bid, the CDF, the PDF, and the risk adjustment parameter. Calculation of the risk-adjusted virtual valuation will be discussed in more detail below with respect to FIG. 2 .
- the computing device selects a winning content item from the eligible content items based on the auction.
- the winning content corresponds with the highest bid of the auction, or, in some instances, one of the next highest bids of the auction (such as when randomization has been applied).
- FIGS. 4A-C Various examples of selecting a winning content item and winning bid are described below with respect to FIGS. 4A-C .
- One example where the highest bid of the auction does not necessarily win the auction is discussed below with respect to FIG. 4C . Allowing for a system that does not necessarily select the highest bid in an auction as a winner of the auction deters possible underbidding by remarketers.
- the computing device sets a price for the winning content item.
- FIGS. 5A-D and the accompanying text describe various scenarios and how a price is set for a winning bid and content item.
- the computing device provides the winning content item in response to the request.
- a CDF may be used, which corresponds to the distribution of the eCPM bids.
- a CDF, F(v) is determined or measured.
- the CDF corresponds to a particular distribution of eCPM bids that content providers have previously placed on a given publisher site.
- eCPM is calculated by dividing total earnings by total number of impressions in thousands.
- eCPM can be used as a performance measure to compare various content units.
- a CDF reflects the range of bids content providers have historically placed on a particular publisher site and contain information about how frequently content providers have bid a particular value.
- PDF probability density function
- the PDF describes the relative likelihood that a particular value bid will be placed by a content provider for a content presentation opportunity.
- a parameter ⁇ (e.g., in the interval [0,1]) that represents a risk adjustment parameter is determined.
- the risk adjustment parameter can indicate an extent or measure to which one wishes to be cautious in trying to charge content providers higher prices when there is a risk that mismeasuring the distributions in steps 202 and 204 could cause revenue loss (such as when used to set prices and to determine in which circumstances one should randomize the allocation of advertisements). If there is high confidence in the calculated distribution, then the risk is determined to be low, so ⁇ in this example is set closer to 0. If there is low confidence in the calculated distribution, then the risk is determined to be high, so ⁇ in this example is set closer to 1.
- the calculation of the risk adjustment factor may be based on the amount of historical data that is available to measure the distribution from which bidder values are drawn. If there is a large amount of historical data that is available to measure the distribution, then there may be high confidence in the measured distribution, and ⁇ may be set closer to 0. If there is a small amount of historical data that is available to measure this distribution, then there may be low confidence in the measured distribution, and ⁇ may be set closer to 1.
- the risk adjustment factor ⁇ may be calculated by setting ⁇ equal to
- ⁇ may be set to be equal to any non-increasing function of n, y(n), such that 0 ⁇ y(n) ⁇ 1 for all n.
- a risk-adjusted virtual valuation is calculated for each content provider's bid based on one or more of the respective bid, the CDF, the PDF, or the risk adjustment parameter.
- the risk-adjusted virtual valuation represents the relative probability that a bid in a narrow range will be received. For example, if v i denotes content provider i's eCPM bid in a particular auction, content provider i's risk-adjusted virtual valuation ⁇ tilde over (v) ⁇ i can be computed
- FIG. 3A shows an example plot 300 of risk-adjusted virtual valuations as a function of content provider bids/values.
- ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuations are determined. For all q ⁇ [0,1], let
- G(q) denote the convex hull of H(q) or the largest convex function satisfying G(q) ⁇ H(q) for all q ⁇ [0,1] and let
- FIG. 3B shows the plot 320 of the ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation as a function of bids/values.
- the non-ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation 300 is shown in FIG. 3A .
- the areas of the plot denoted by a dashed line 322 have been “ironed” and replaced by a flat, “ironed” line 324 in the plot.
- the ironing is performed at a mid-value range in the distribution of risk-adjusted virtual valuations.
- the determination of where to iron the risk-adjusted virtual valuation is based on the location of a convex hull in the risk-adjusted virtual valuation plot. In some implementations, the goal is to choose the smallest convex function that meets certain criteria that approximately equalizes the areas. In some implementations, the goal in choosing where to iron is to approximately equalize areas in the risk-adjusted virtual valuation plot. In other implementations the determination of where to iron the risk-adjusted virtual valuation is based on a location of the largest convex function that is less than or equal to an integral of the risk-adjusted virtual valuation plot.
- the content providers are ranked in order of their ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuations.
- a winner is selected based on the ranking. In some implementations, determining which content provider wins the auction, three special case scenarios may be considered.
- FIG. 4A shows a first scenario where the highest bid, v 1 , has a negative ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation. In this situation, the system may decide that no content provider wins the auction, and no content is displayed responsive to the received request.
- FIG. 4B shows a second scenario where a highest bid, v 1 , has the highest positive ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation. In this situation, the content provider who bid a value of v 1 wins the auction.
- FIG. 4C shows a third scenario in which two bids, v 1 and v 2 , are tied for the highest positive ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation. In this scenario, the two content providers who bid v 1 and v 2 win the auction with a probability of 1 ⁇ 2.
- This scenario may be described mathematically: if there are multiple content providers who are all tied for having the highest ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation, g(F ⁇ 1 (v)), and g(F ⁇ 1 (v))>0 for each of these content providers, then each of these content providers wins the auction with a probability of
- n denotes the number of content providers who are tied for having the highest ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation.
- a price is set for the winning content provider.
- the following four special case scenarios may be considered.
- FIG. 5A shows a first scenario where the bidder who placed the highest bid v 1 has the only positive ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation. In such a situation, the bidder who placed winning bid v 1 wins the auction and pays price r.
- FIG. 5B shows a second scenario where the highest bidder placed bid v 1 and the second highest bidder placed bid v 2 . Both v 1 and v 2 have positive (non-ironed) risk-adjusted virtual valuations.
- the bidder who placed bid v 1 wins the auction and pays price v 2 .
- content provider i has the highest ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation, g(F ⁇ 1 (v i ))
- no other content provider has the same ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation as content provider i, and g(F ⁇ 1 (v i ))>0.
- content provider j has the second highest ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation that g(F ⁇ 1 (v i ))>0 and g(F ⁇ 1 (v)) is strictly increasing in v for all v in some small neighborhood of v j (e.g., the neighborhood being defined in terms of a range near and including v j ), then content provider i pays a price v j .
- FIG. 5C shows a third scenario where the high bidder has the highest positive ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation, v 1 , and second highest bidder has a positive risk-adjusted virtual valuation, v 2 , that is ironed.
- the bidder who placed a bid of v 1 wins the auction and pays a price
- FIG. 5D shows a fourth scenario where the two highest bidders are tied for the highest positive ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation, v 1 and v 2 .
- each of the bidders wins the auction with probability 1 ⁇ 2 and pay price v L , conditional on winning the auction.
- g(F ⁇ 1 (v)) suppose there are multiple content providers who are all tied for having the highest ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation, g(F ⁇ 1 (v)), and g(F ⁇ 1 (v))>0 for each of these content providers.
- the content item associated with the winning bid is presented in response to the request, and the content provider who placed the winning bid is charged the set price.
- This methods described herein differ from existing methods for setting prices for content providers primarily in that it combines measures of one or more of a CDF, a pdf, and/or a risk adjustment parameter to create an ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation that is then used in auction ranking and pricing.
- This methodology has several advantages over existing methods to set allocations and prices in auctions.
- First, the methodology enables one to charge relatively high prices to content providers who are an unusually good match (e.g., remarketers) for a particular query even in situations where reserve prices are ineffective.
- Second, the methods presented provide an optimal way to set allocations and prices in auctions for a single content presentation opportunity when one wishes to maximize a weighted average of efficiency (total value) and revenue.
- the methods presented enable one to set a risk adjustment parameter to adjust how aggressively one wishes to use measures of the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function to tweak ranking and pricing in an auction.
- this risk adjustment parameter may be optimized on a query-by-query basis and set to different values for different queries. For example, in queries that are from a publisher where a lot of data on past bids is available and confidence is high in the calculated CDFs and PDFs, it may be determined that there is small risk that the distribution measurement is incorrect. In those instances, a risk adjustment parameter that is, for example, closer to zero can be used. By contrast, if the query is for a publisher where very little data on bids that have been made historically is available and there is little confidence in the measures of the CDFs and PDFs, a risk adjustment parameter, for example, closer to one may be used to reflect the low level of confidence.
- a server system may be a combination of hardware and software that provides a service or a set of services.
- a set of physically separate and networked computerized devices may operate together as a logical server system unit to handle the operations necessary to offer a service to hundreds of individual computing devices.

Description
- The present specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided while providing the resources. For example, when a person performs an online search, content for businesses relating to the online search can also be presented to the user. Because the content is for businesses relating to the person's search, the person will presumably be interested in the content.
- Selection and presentation of content can affect a user's level of interest. If content is selected at random, a user will most likely be less interested than if content is selected for a particular user. As such, many advertisers seek to focus their advertisements toward specific users and may be willing to pay more to have their advertisements shown to those specific users.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in processes that include setting allocations and prices in auctions. The process includes receiving a request for content for presentation in association with one or more presentation opportunities on a publisher site. The process further includes determining one or more eligible content items based on the received request. The process also includes, determining bids associated with each eligible content item, determining a historical bid distribution for bids that have been identified when selecting content for presentation on the publisher site, determining a risk adjustment parameter that reflects a measure of confidence in the accuracy of the historical bid distribution, conducting an auction including scoring the determined eligible content items based on the historical bid distribution, their respective bids, and the risk adjustment parameter, selecting a winning content item from the eligible content items based on the auction, setting a price for the winning content item, and providing the winning content item in response to the request.
- These and other implementations may each optionally include the following features. For instance, in some implementations, selecting the winning content item comprises selecting a highest bid. In some implementations, selecting the winning content item comprises selecting between at least two highest bids.
- In some implementations, determining the historical bid distribution for bids that have been identified when selecting content for presentation on the publisher site comprises determining a cumulative distribution function for the publisher site. Determining the historical bid distribution for bids that have been identified when selecting content for presentation on the publisher site may further comprise determining a probability density function using the cumulative distribution function for the publisher site. In some implementations, the risk adjustment parameter is a function of an amount of historical bid data available for the publisher site.
- In some implementations, scoring the determined eligible content items based on the historical bid distribution, their respective bids, and the risk adjustment parameter includes, for each bid associated with a particular eligible content item, calculating a risk-adjusted virtual valuation based on the historical bid distribution, the particular bid, and the risk adjustment parameter. In some implementations, scoring the determined eligible content items further includes generating risk-adjusted virtual valuations as a function of the bids. In some implementations, scoring the determined eligible content items further includes generating an ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation as a function of the bids. In some implementations, the ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation is a non-decreasing function of the bids. In some implementations, selecting the winning content item includes ranking the eligible content items based on their corresponding ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuations.
- In some implementations, setting the price for the winning content item includes selecting the price at a bottom range associated with the one or more entities that are specifically interested in the one or more content presentation opportunities. In some implementations, setting the price for the winning content item includes computing an average of a set of highest bids.
- In other implementations, a method includes receiving a request for content for presentation association with one or more presentation opportunities on a publisher site, determining one or more eligible content items based on the received request, determining bids associated with each eligible content item, determining a cumulative distribution function corresponding to a distribution of bids that a plurality of advertisers have previously placed for a publisher site, determining a risk adjustment parameter that reflects a measure of confidence in the accuracy of the historical bid distribution, for each bid, calculating a risk-adjusted virtual valuation based on each respective bid, the cumulative distribution function, and the risk adjustment parameter, ranking the bids based on the calculated risk-adjusted virtual valuations and selecting a winning bid based on the ranking, setting a price for the winning bid, and providing the winning content item in response to the request.
- These and other implementations may each optionally include the following features. For instance, in some implementations, the risk adjustment parameter is a function of an amount of historical bid data available for the publisher site. In some implementations, the process further comprises determining a probability density function corresponding to the cumulative distribution function, wherein the calculation of the risk-adjusted virtual valuation is further based on the probability density function. In some implementations, the process further comprises determining an ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation that comprises a non-decreasing function.
- In some implementations, selecting the winning bid includes selecting a non-highest bid as the winning bid. In some implementations, setting the price for the winning content item includes computing an average of a set of highest bids.
- In some implementations, a system comprises one or more computer processors and one or more non-transitory computer readable devices that include instructions that, when executed by the one or more computer processors, causes the processors to perform processes described herein.
- The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

FIG. 6 is a conceptual diagram of a system that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- This document describes systems and techniques for setting allocations and prices for content in an auction. For example, in a remarketing scenario, an advertiser may desire to show an advertisement to a user who has previously visited the advertiser's website. The term “remarketing,” as it is used herein, refers to presenting content (e.g., an advertisement) to a user who has previously visited the content provider's website, domain, or otherwise interacted with content, an application or resource of a content provider. The content provider may recognize the previous visit, for example, through the use of cookies, tokens or other identifiers. In these instances, the remarketing content provider may be willing to bid significantly higher than other non-remarketing content providers for a given impression. However, in second-price auctions, publishers are generally unable to effectively monetize on remarketing scenarios. For example, a remarketing content provider may be willing to pay five times as much as the next highest non-remarketing content provider, but because of the use of a second price auction, the remarketing content provider only pays the publisher (in this example) about 20% of what he was willing to pay.
- In order to more effectively monetize remarketing scenarios, the methods described herein determine information about the expected distribution of bids for a particular publisher, calculate corresponding probabilities, and compute risk-adjusted virtual valuation for each content provider in the auction. Based on these calculations, auction ranking and pricing is determined, as described herein.
- In some implementations, in order to deter remarking content providers from decreasing their bids, the selection of a winning bidder may include a randomized mechanism. For example, if two highest ranked content providers each place bids in a middle range (e.g., where one of the content providers is a remarketer who has lowered his bid and one is not a remarketer), then the system introduces a randomized mechanism for values in that middle range. That is, if the two highest ranked content providers are treated as if they both have the highest bid, then each content provider has a 50% chance of winning the auction, even if the remarketing content provider had a slightly higher bid than the non-remarketing content provider. Ultimately, introducing the randomized mechanism deters remarketing content providers from lowering their bids because there is a chance that remarketing content providers' bids will be randomized and they will not win the auction.
- Referring to
FIG. 1 , a flow chart shows amethod 100 for setting allocations and prices in auctions in response to a request for content. Atstep 102, a computing device receives a request for content, such as for presentation in one or more slots on a publisher site. This may be, for example, in a situation where a web page is to be presented to a user, and the web page includes a slot for one or more content items. The slot can be filled by submitting a request for content for presentation on the publisher site. The request may be sent to an advertising server or other content management system. The content may be in the form of an advertisement, such as a web banner, a pop-up ad, a video ad, an audio ad, or the like. The advertisement may alternatively be a keyword ad or a search ad. Other forms of sponsored content are possible. - At
step 104, the computing device determines one or more eligible content items based on the received request. The one or more eligible content items may be in the form of advertisements. The eligible content items can be in inventory and sourced by various content providers who may be, for example, advertisers hoping to attract customers to their web sites. Atstep 106, the computing device determines bids associated with each eligible content item. The content providers that provide the one or more eligible content items submit their respective content items with a bid associated with the content item. The bid is somewhat reflective of the value that the particular content provider places on the particular slot. For example, if a remarketing content provider (e.g., advertiser) knows that the slot is located on a web page that will be displayed to a user on the content provider's customer list (e.g., a list of users who have previously visited the content provider's web site), that content provider would likely place a higher value on the particular slot that a different content provider who has had no prior interactions with the user. If an advertiser determines than an advertising opportunity is available to present content to a user on the customer list, that advertiser would likely be willing to pay more than a non-remarketing advertiser because of the higher probability that the user will be interested in the advertiser and generate a conversion. - At
step 108, the computing device determines a historical bid distribution for bids that have been identified when selecting content for presentation on the publisher site. Various methods can be used to determine the historical bid distribution. The paper, “Optimal Auctions” by Roger Myerson (published in Mathematics of Operations Research in 1981) developed a theoretically optimal way to conduct an auction for a single content presentation opportunity when one knows the exact distribution from which bidder values are drawn. While this is a useful benchmark, the methods described herein instead focus on how to best conduct an auction where one's measure of the distribution from which bidder values are drawn is imprecise and simply applying the Myerson (1981) framework could lead to significant revenue loss if the measure of this distribution is too imprecise. In some instances, a cumulative distribution function (CDF) is measured, which corresponds to the distribution of the effective cost per thousand impressions (eCPM) bids that content providers have placed on a given publisher web site. A CDF reflects the range of bids that content providers have historically made on a particular publisher web site and how frequently content providers have placed bids of each value. In some instances, the CDF is used to compute a probability density function for the CDF. Because the calculated distributions are estimates, the distributions may not be exact. In some instances, a parameter that represents a risk adjustment is used that indicates an extent to which one wishes to be cautious in trying to charge content providers higher prices when there is a risk that mismeasuring the distributions could cause revenue loss. This risk adjustment parameter, α, reflects how much the system will adjust a virtual valuation of a presentation opportunity (e.g., an ad slot) in response to calculated distributions. Risk adjustment parameter, α, may normalized and be described in the interval [0,1]. If there is high confidence in the calculated distribution, then the risk is determined to be low, so α is set closer to 0. If there is low confidence in the calculated distribution, then the risk is determined to be high, so α is set closer to 1. The risk adjustment factor may be reflective of an amount of historical bid data that is available for a particular publisher. If a lot of historical bid data is available, there is higher confidence in the calculated distribution than if not much historical bid data is available. The risk adjustment may also reflect a level of accuracy in the estimated distributions of bids. - At
step 110, the computing device conducts an auction including scoring the determined eligible content items based on the historical bid distribution and their respective bids. Scoring the determined eligible content items based on the historical bid distributions and their respective bids may include, for example, calculating a risk-adjusted virtual valuation for each content provider that placed a respective bid. In some implementations, each calculated risk-adjusted virtual valuation is a function of a particular content provider's eCPM bid, the CDF, the PDF, and the risk adjustment parameter. Calculation of the risk-adjusted virtual valuation will be discussed in more detail below with respect toFIG. 2 . - At
step 112, the computing device selects a winning content item from the eligible content items based on the auction. The winning content corresponds with the highest bid of the auction, or, in some instances, one of the next highest bids of the auction (such as when randomization has been applied). Various examples of selecting a winning content item and winning bid are described below with respect toFIGS. 4A-C . One example where the highest bid of the auction does not necessarily win the auction is discussed below with respect toFIG. 4C . Allowing for a system that does not necessarily select the highest bid in an auction as a winner of the auction deters possible underbidding by remarketers. - At
step 114, the computing device sets a price for the winning content item.FIGS. 5A-D and the accompanying text describe various scenarios and how a price is set for a winning bid and content item. Atstep 116, the computing device provides the winning content item in response to the request. - Various methods may be used to employ an expected distribution of bids for a particular auction to select a winning bid and set a price for the winning bid in response to a request for content for presentation. Referring to
FIG. 2 , a CDF may be used, which corresponds to the distribution of the eCPM bids. Instep 202, a CDF, F(v), is determined or measured. The CDF corresponds to a particular distribution of eCPM bids that content providers have previously placed on a given publisher site. eCPM is calculated by dividing total earnings by total number of impressions in thousands. eCPM can be used as a performance measure to compare various content units. A CDF reflects the range of bids content providers have historically placed on a particular publisher site and contain information about how frequently content providers have bid a particular value. - In
step 204, a probability density function (PDF), -
- is computed for the CDF. The PDF describes the relative likelihood that a particular value bid will be placed by a content provider for a content presentation opportunity.
- In
step 206, a parameter α (e.g., in the interval [0,1]) that represents a risk adjustment parameter is determined. As described above, the risk adjustment parameter can indicate an extent or measure to which one wishes to be cautious in trying to charge content providers higher prices when there is a risk that mismeasuring the distributions insteps - In some implementations, the calculation of the risk adjustment factor may be based on the amount of historical data that is available to measure the distribution from which bidder values are drawn. If there is a large amount of historical data that is available to measure the distribution, then there may be high confidence in the measured distribution, and α may be set closer to 0. If there is a small amount of historical data that is available to measure this distribution, then there may be low confidence in the measured distribution, and α may be set closer to 1.
- As an example implementation, suppose that there have been n auctions on a particular publisher in a particular time period. In this case, the risk adjustment factor α may be calculated by setting α equal to
-
- More generally, α may be set to be equal to any non-increasing function of n, y(n), such that 0≦y(n)≦1 for all n.
- In step, 208, a risk-adjusted virtual valuation is calculated for each content provider's bid based on one or more of the respective bid, the CDF, the PDF, or the risk adjustment parameter. In some implementations, the risk-adjusted virtual valuation represents the relative probability that a bid in a narrow range will be received. For example, if vi denotes content provider i's eCPM bid in a particular auction, content provider i's risk-adjusted virtual valuation {tilde over (v)}i can be computed
-

FIG. 3A shows anexample plot 300 of risk-adjusted virtual valuations as a function of content provider bids/values. - At
step 210, ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuations are determined. For all q ∈ [0,1], let -
- and let H(q)≡∫o qh(r)dr. Also, let G(q) denote the convex hull of H(q) or the largest convex function satisfying G(q)≦H(q) for all q ∈ [0,1] and let
-
- The ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation for a content provider with value vi is then g(F−1(vi)).
FIG. 3B shows theplot 320 of the ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation as a function of bids/values. The non-ironed risk-adjustedvirtual valuation 300 is shown inFIG. 3A . As shown inFIG. 3B , the areas of the plot denoted by a dashedline 322 have been “ironed” and replaced by a flat, “ironed”line 324 in the plot. In some implementations, the ironing is performed at a mid-value range in the distribution of risk-adjusted virtual valuations. The exact mid-range is based on the particular distribution, but the result of the ironing is a non-decreasing risk-adjusted virtual valuation as a function of the bids/values. In some implementations, the determination of where to iron the risk-adjusted virtual valuation is based on the location of a convex hull in the risk-adjusted virtual valuation plot. In some implementations, the goal is to choose the smallest convex function that meets certain criteria that approximately equalizes the areas. In some implementations, the goal in choosing where to iron is to approximately equalize areas in the risk-adjusted virtual valuation plot. In other implementations the determination of where to iron the risk-adjusted virtual valuation is based on a location of the largest convex function that is less than or equal to an integral of the risk-adjusted virtual valuation plot. - At
step 212, the content providers are ranked in order of their ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuations. Atstep 214, a winner is selected based on the ranking. In some implementations, determining which content provider wins the auction, three special case scenarios may be considered.FIG. 4A shows a first scenario where the highest bid, v1, has a negative ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation. In this situation, the system may decide that no content provider wins the auction, and no content is displayed responsive to the received request. This scenario may be described mathematically: if the ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation for content provider i, g(F−1(vi)), satisfies g(F−1(vi))≦0 for all i, then no content provider wins the auction.FIG. 4B shows a second scenario where a highest bid, v1, has the highest positive ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation. In this situation, the content provider who bid a value of v1 wins the auction. This scenario may be described mathematically: if content provider i has the highest ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation, g(F−1(vi)), and no other content provider has the same risk-adjusted virtual valuation as content provider i, and g(F−1(vi))>0, then content provider i wins the auction.FIG. 4C shows a third scenario in which two bids, v1 and v2, are tied for the highest positive ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation. In this scenario, the two content providers who bid v1 and v2 win the auction with a probability of ½. This scenario may be described mathematically: if there are multiple content providers who are all tied for having the highest ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation, g(F−1(v)), and g(F−1(v))>0 for each of these content providers, then each of these content providers wins the auction with a probability of -
- where n denotes the number of content providers who are tied for having the highest ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation.
- At
step 216, a price is set for the winning content provider. In some implementations, when setting prices, the following four special case scenarios may be considered.FIG. 5A shows a first scenario where the bidder who placed the highest bid v1 has the only positive ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation. In such a situation, the bidder who placed winning bid v1 wins the auction and pays price r. Explained mathematically, if content provider i has an ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation, g(F−1(vi)) satisfying g(F−1(vi))>0 and all other content providers j have ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuations satisfying g(F−1(vi))≦0, then content provider i pays a price equal to the largest v for which g(F−1(v))=0. InFIG. 5A , the largest v for which g(F−1(0)=0 is the price r. -
FIG. 5B shows a second scenario where the highest bidder placed bid v1 and the second highest bidder placed bid v2. Both v1 and v2 have positive (non-ironed) risk-adjusted virtual valuations. In this scenario, the bidder who placed bid v1 wins the auction and pays price v2. Explained mathematically, suppose content provider i has the highest ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation, g(F−1(vi)), no other content provider has the same ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation as content provider i, and g(F−1(vi))>0. Also, suppose that if content provider j has the second highest ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation that g(F−1(vi))>0 and g(F−1(v)) is strictly increasing in v for all v in some small neighborhood of vj (e.g., the neighborhood being defined in terms of a range near and including vj), then content provider i pays a price vj. -
FIG. 5C shows a third scenario where the high bidder has the highest positive ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation, v1, and second highest bidder has a positive risk-adjusted virtual valuation, v2, that is ironed. In this scenario, the bidder who placed a bid of v1 wins the auction and pays a price -
- Explained mathematically, suppose content provider i has the highest ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation, g(F−1(vi)), no other content provider has the same ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation as content provider i, and g(F−1(vi))>0. Also, suppose that if content provider j has the second highest ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation that g (F−1(vj))>0 and there is some small neighborhood (e.g., as described above) of vj for which g(F−1(v)) is independent of v. Finally, let m denote the number of content providers who have ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuations, g(F−1(v)), equal to g (F−1(vj)). Then if vH denotes the highest value for which g(F−1(vH))=g (F−1(vj)), and vL denotes the lowest value for which g(F−1(vL))=g(F−1(vj)), then content provider i pays a price of

FIG. 5D shows a fourth scenario where the two highest bidders are tied for the highest positive ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation, v1 and v2. In this scenario, each of the bidders wins the auction with probability ½ and pay price vL, conditional on winning the auction. Explained in mathematical terms, suppose there are multiple content providers who are all tied for having the highest ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation, g(F−1(v)), and g(F−1(v))>0 for each of these content providers. Then, if vL denotes the lowest value for which g(F−1(vL))=g(F−1(vi)), where g(F−1(vi)) denotes the ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation of one of the content providers who is tied for having the highest ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation, then the winner of the auction pays a price equal to vL. - After a winning bid is selected and a price is set, the content item associated with the winning bid is presented in response to the request, and the content provider who placed the winning bid is charged the set price.
- This methods described herein differ from existing methods for setting prices for content providers primarily in that it combines measures of one or more of a CDF, a pdf, and/or a risk adjustment parameter to create an ironed risk-adjusted virtual valuation that is then used in auction ranking and pricing.
- This methodology has several advantages over existing methods to set allocations and prices in auctions. First, the methodology enables one to charge relatively high prices to content providers who are an unusually good match (e.g., remarketers) for a particular query even in situations where reserve prices are ineffective. Second, the methods presented provide an optimal way to set allocations and prices in auctions for a single content presentation opportunity when one wishes to maximize a weighted average of efficiency (total value) and revenue. Finally, the methods presented enable one to set a risk adjustment parameter to adjust how aggressively one wishes to use measures of the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function to tweak ranking and pricing in an auction.
- Furthermore, the value of this risk adjustment parameter may be optimized on a query-by-query basis and set to different values for different queries. For example, in queries that are from a publisher where a lot of data on past bids is available and confidence is high in the calculated CDFs and PDFs, it may be determined that there is small risk that the distribution measurement is incorrect. In those instances, a risk adjustment parameter that is, for example, closer to zero can be used. By contrast, if the query is for a publisher where very little data on bids that have been made historically is available and there is little confidence in the measures of the CDFs and PDFs, a risk adjustment parameter, for example, closer to one may be used to reflect the low level of confidence.
- These and other services may be implemented in a server system. A server system may be a combination of hardware and software that provides a service or a set of services. For example, a set of physically separate and networked computerized devices may operate together as a logical server system unit to handle the operations necessary to offer a service to hundreds of individual computing devices.
- In various implementations, operations that are performed “in response” to another operation (e.g., a determination or an identification) are not performed if the prior operation is unsuccessful (e.g., if the determination was not performed). Features in this document that are described with conditional language may describe implementations that are optional. In some examples, “transmitting” from a first device to a second device includes the first device placing data into a network for receipt by the second device, but may not include the second device receiving the data.
