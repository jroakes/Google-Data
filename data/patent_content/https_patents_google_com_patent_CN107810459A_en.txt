Fig. 4 is depicted to be identified as audio streaming transmitting device by its apparatus for receiving audio to receive positioned at audio and filled
One example of the another method (scheme) at least part of front put.Method in Fig. 4 is usually using sound location technology
To determine position of the audio streaming transmitting device relative to apparatus for receiving audio.Based on the sound sent by audio streaming transmitting device
One or more characteristics of frequency signal, apparatus for receiving audio can determine the relative position of audio streaming transmitting device.Specifically,
Between the audio signal that two or more microphone set by the separation point position on apparatus for receiving audio detects
Difference audio streaming transmitting device can be indicated relative to apparatus for receiving audio (or one relative to apparatus for receiving audio
Point) position.
In the example of fig. 4, one group of wireless headset 400 includes being used to detect raising one's voice by audio streaming transmitting device 410
The pairing microphone 406,408 of the identification signal based on audio that device 412 is sent.Audio streaming transmitting device 410 can be utilized
Identifier (Bluetooth MAC address for such as, being assigned uniquely to audio streaming transmitting device 410) comes to by loudspeaker 412
The identification signal sent is encoded.In some embodiments, the drummy speech sent by loudspeaker 412 can be modulated
MAC Address or other identifiers so that identification signal on the earshot of most people (for example, being higher than 20kHz).Match somebody with somebody
Identification signal can be detected to the first microphone 406 in microphone 406,408 reaches ear from audio streaming transmitting device 410
Part I at the right loudspeaker of machine 400, and the left side that earphone 400 is reached from audio streaming transmitting device 410 of identification signal
Part II at loudspeaker can be detected by second microphone 408.Then, one or more computers on earphone 400 can

The relative position of the difference instruction audio streaming transmitting device 410 for the part not detected.Because audio signal must be from raising one's voice
The increase of the distance of one that device 412 is advanced in microphone 406,408, so the amplitude of signal may decay more severe.This
Outside, sound is reached any one transmission delay in microphone 406,408 can with loudspeaker 412 and microphone 406,
The distance between 408 increase and increase.Equally, the identification based on audio detected by the first and second microphones 406,408
Difference between the amplitude and time delay of the part of signal can indicate that audio streaming transmitting device 410 is more adjacent to the first wheat
Gram wind 406 is still more adjacent to second microphone 408.When amplitude, time delay or both difference are less than the threshold difference different time,
Earphone 400 can determine that transmitting device 410 as a stream is currently located between the left speaker of earphone 400 and right loudspeaker 402,404,
And the front of earphone 400 is upwardly-directed towards the side of stream transmission device 410.Then, if user has been indicated to send out
Rise pairing intention, then earphone 400 can by using the identifier encoded in the identification signal based on audio come pair and sound
The frequency stream transmission pairing of device 410 responds.In some embodiments, three, four, five or more Mikes
Wind can keep apart between each opening position of earphone 400, and can determine what each place in these earphones detected
Difference between identification signal based on audio, more accurately to identify the position of audio streaming transmitting device 410.
In some embodiments, the thing in addition to sound location technology or alternatively, other bases can be used
Stream transmission device that apparatus for receiving audio orients towards it is identified in the identification technology of sound.For example, stream transmission device
Can have and send the drummy speech using the identifier code for transmitting device as a stream (for example, as sent by loudspeaker 412
Identification signal) loudspeaker.Tone can generally be sent with comprehensive, or can point to one or more specific directions.In order to
Detection streaming transmitting device is located at the front of the front of reception device or the part of reception device, and reception device can have
To the sound sensitive launched from the front of microphone, but the orientation wheat that the sound to launching from other directions is substantially insensitive
Gram wind.It can be come from by microphone arrangement on the reception device with being detected when reception device is towards stream transmission device orient
Transmit the high frequency identification signal of device as a stream.In addition, if multiple audio streaming transmitting devices are located adjacent one another and multiple audios
Each audio streaming transmitting device in stream transmission device sends the corresponding knowledge detected by the microphone of apparatus for receiving audio
Level signal, then the destination apparatus matched with it can be selected based on the characteristic of corresponding signal.For example, can be according to maximum intensity
The expectation that signal is most directly toward the stream transmission device transmitting of its orientation from reception device is most high-strength to select its signal to have
The stream transmission device of degree is used to match.
In some embodiments, audio streaming transmitting device can periodically or continuously send high-frequency audio knowledge
Level signal.In this manner it is achieved that whenever user it is expected with audio streaming transmitting device match, signal can be increasingly available for by
The detection that apparatus for receiving audio is carried out.Certainly, in some cases, such as, wherein it is expected to minimize stream transmission device
In the case of power consumption, it can not expect to be repeated continuously transmitting.Therefore, in some embodiments, can be by streaming device
It is configured to only send its identification signal after request.For example, apparatus for receiving audio can have loudspeaker, in response to initiation
User's input of pairing, the loudspeaker is sent so that any stream transmission device in the range of apparatus for receiving audio starts to send out
Go out the activation signal of its corresponding identification signal.In some embodiments, activation signal can be by apparatus for receiving audio
The high-frequency audio signal (for example, being higher than 20kHz) that one or more loudspeakers play.Then, stream transmission device can have
Microphone, microphone detection activation signal, and can be by sending audio, red according to any embodiment described herein
Outer or other types of identification signal responds to activation signal.In some embodiments, can utilize previously
The identifier of the stream transmission device of warp-wise reception device registration encodes to activation signal so that activation signal only activates
Belong to the specific device of specific user.If for example, in the range of activation signal and it can may belong to other users'
The respective identifier of stream transmission device is not contained in signal, then these stream transmission devices can ignore activation signal
(for example, by not sending identification signal in response to activation signal selection).
Referring again to Fig. 2A, in the apparatus for receiving audio (rank for recognizing the first audio streaming transmitting device and being oriented towards it
Section 204) after, the process 200 that reception device is matched with the first streaming transmitting device is continued.At the stage 208, reception device
