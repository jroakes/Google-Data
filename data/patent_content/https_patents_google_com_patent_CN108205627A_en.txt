As an example, offline syntactic model 76 can support the dynamic of " setting is reminded " such as with type of reminders parameter
Make, the type of reminders parameter specifies the type for the prompting to be set, specifies one or more articles associated with prompting
The time parameter of time that item parameter and specified activation are reminded and remind user.Parser modules 68 can receive token
Sequence, such as " remind me to (reminding me) ", " pick up (taking) ", " bread (bread) " and " after work (
After work) ", and sequence of tokens is mapped to and utilizes the prompting class for being arranged to " shopping reminder (shopping is reminded) "
Shape parameter, is arranged to " 5 at the item parameter for being arranged to " bread ":The time parameter of 00pm " sets the action of prompting,
Cause that afternoon 5:00, user receives the prompting of " buy bread (purchase bread) ".
Parser modules 68 can also together work with the dialog manager module 70 managed with user session.In this field
Under border, dialogue refers to the set of the phonetic entry similar to two person-to-person dialogues and response.Therefore, module 70 keeps dialogue
" state ", to realize the letter obtained in the phonetic entry previous used during subsequent phonetic entry is handled from user
Breath.Thus, for example, if user says " remind me to pick up bread (me is reminded to take bread) ", sound can be generated
" ok, when would you like to be reminded for answering(good, when to want to remind) " so that then
Phonetic entry " after work " raw requests will be tied back to create remind.In some embodiments, module 70 can
To be implemented as the part of interactive assistant module 56.
Acting composer module 72, analytically device module 68 receives the parsing text for representing that phonetic entry is explained, and generate
One or more response actions or " task " are used for the module 62 by interactive assistant module 56 together with any associated parameter
It is handled.Action composer module 72 may rely on one or more offline play models 78, wherein comprising for from solution
Analyse the various rules of text creation action.It should be appreciated that some parameters can directly be received as phonetic entry, and some are joined
Number can determine otherwise, such as the position based on user, demographic information or based on other distinctive letters of user
Breath.For example, if user says that " remind me to pick up bread at the grocery store (remind me miscellaneous
Shop takes bread) ", in the current location, user without such as user known route between work and family, user it is normal
In the case of the additional information for advising grocery store etc., location parameter may be not confirmable.
It should be appreciated that in some embodiments, model 74,76 and 78 can be combined into less model or be divided into additional
Model, such as the function of module 64,68,70 and 72.In addition, model 74-78 is referred to herein as off-line model, as long as model
It is locally stored in voice-enabled equipment 52, and thus can be offline when equipment 52 does not communicate with online semantic processor 54

100.Routine 100 starts from block 102 by receiving phonetic entry (for example, in the form of digital audio and video signals).In the embodiment party
In formula, make initial trial and phonetic entry is forwarded to on-line search service (block 104).If it fails, for example, due to lacking
Connection lacks the response from on-line search service, and block 106 passes control to block 108 so that phonetic entry is converted to text
Token (block 108, for example, the module 64 using Fig. 2), parsing text token (block 110, for example, the module 68 using Fig. 2), simultaneously
And act (block 112, for example, the module 72 using Fig. 2) from the text structure through parsing.Then it acts to hold by obtained
The rendering of row client and synchronous (block 114, such as the module 62 using Fig. 2), and the processing of phonetic entry is completed.
Back to block 106, if phonetic entry to be forwarded to the trial and success of on-line search service, block 106 bypasses block
108-112, and control is directly delivered to block 114 with perform client-side render with it is synchronous.Then the place of phonetic entry is completed
Reason.It should be appreciated that in other embodiments, as set forth above, it is possible to processed offline be attempted before online processing, for example, working as
Phonetic entry can avoid unnecessary data from communicating in processing locality.
It can be how individually or with corresponding online based on voice Fig. 4 schematically shows interactive assistant module 56
Processor 80 infer automatically in the case where needing or not needing to seek license from control user first in combination or condition
It is assumed to request user and the example of the license of the access of resource controlled other users (so-called " control user ") is provided
Scene 420.In this example, first movement phone 422A is operated by first user's (not shown), the second mobile phone 422B by
Second user (not shown) operates.
Assuming that the configured first movement phone 422A of the first user to be to refuse incoming call, unless meeting certain standards
Then.For example, the first user may take on the telephone currently using first movement phone 422A and other people, may just be moved using first
Mobile phone 422A carries out video conference or may first movement phone 422A be set as to " not interfere " to set with other people
It puts.It is further assumed that second user operated the second mobile phone 422B with for example via one or more cellular towers 424 to
First movement phone 422A sends out calling.
In various embodiments, first movement phone 422A or represent first movement phone 422A and/or first use
The interactive assistant module operated elsewhere at family is (for example, above-mentioned 56) can detect incoming call and be construed as second
User is for accessing the given resource by the first user's control --- and the voice communication i.e. between the first user and second user is believed
Road --- request.In some embodiments, interactive assistant module can move electricity by incoming telephone number or with second
Talk about the associated other identifier symbols of 422B and (for example, the contact included in the memory for being stored in first movement phone 422A
In list) the contact person of the first user match.Then, interactive assistant module can determine that it lacks to the second use
Family provides the prior license for accessing the voice communication channel between the first and second users.
However, even if the first user is currently contacting with other people or is being set as first movement phone 422A
" not bother ", interactive assistant module can also attempt to infer whether the first user wishes to receive being passed to from second user
Call rather than simply deny incoming call.Therefore, in various embodiments, interactive assistant module can determine
One or more attributes of the first relationship between one and second user.In addition, interactive assistant module can determine the first use
The one or more of other one or more relationships between family and one or more other users in addition to second user belong to
Property.In some cases, interactive assistant module can have in the current situation to the offer pair of one or more other users
With the prior license of the access of the voice communication channel of the first user.
Then, interactive assistant module can be by one or more attributes of the first relationship between the first and second users
One of other one or more relationships between one or more other users with the first user and in addition to second user
Or multiple attributes are compared.Based on comparing, interactive assistant module can with condition assume (for example, infer, speculate) license
With the access to second user offer pair with the voice communication channel of the first user.In some cases, interactive assistant module
The output that confirmation is solicited to the first user can be provided.In other cases, interactive assistant module can not first seek
The incoming call of second user can be transferred to the visit of first movement phone 422A in the case of confirmation to second user offer
It asks.For example, the first user can receive the biography that he or she can select to receive with him or she on first movement phone 422A
Enter the notice of calling (for example, Call Waiting).Addition or alternatively, interactive assistant module can automatically add second user
It is added to the first user and existing the exhaling of part participation that first movement phone 422A is for example called as Multi-Party Conference is used
Cry session.
In some embodiments, interactive assistant module can be based on the relationship between the first user and second user
Property accesses authorizing second user the license of resource (voice communication channel with the first user) to speculate.Assuming that the first user
The few members of identical lineal relative with second user, and the first user previously authorized first movement phone 422A (and/
Or by the first user's operation equipment the ecosystem other equipment) on the interactive assistant module that operates permit with transfer Lai
From the incoming call of another lineal relative member.Interactive assistant module can be assumed due to the first user previously
The license for another lineal relative member that transfers is authorized, so second user also should be relayed, because second user is also the
The member of the lineal relative of one user.
In other embodiments, interactive assistant module can compare the first and second users using different technologies
Between relationship and the first user and other users between relationship.For example, in some embodiments, interactive assistant module
Multiple feature vectors can be formed, one of feature vector represents the attribute of the first user, and another feature vector represents second
The attribute of user and one or more additional eigenvectors correspondingly represent that one or more other users have with the first user
There is relationship (and license of relayed call).In some such embodiments, interactive assistant module can be from contact person
List, social network profile (for example, " friend " list), and/or other similar contact's resources associated with the first user
To form these feature vectors.It can extract to be included in the spy in corresponding feature vector from each contact person of the first user
Sign can include but is not limited to：Relationship between first user and contact person it is clearly specified (for example, " spouse ", " fraternal elder sister
Younger sister ", " parent ", " cousin ", " colleague ", " friend ", " classmate ", " acquaintance " etc.), between the first user and contact person altogether
Interactive history between the multiple contact persons, the first user and the contact person that enjoy is (for example, call history/frequency, text history/frequency
Rate, shared calendar appointment etc.), the demographics (such as age, gender, address) of contact person, authorize interactive assistant to contact
People provides contact to license of access of various resources by the first user's control etc..
Then, interactive assistant module can be for example using one or more machine learning models (for example, logistic regression)
Determine " distance " in dimensional space between at least some of multiple feature vectors feature vector, to be embedded in reduction etc..
In some embodiments, Machine learning classifiers or model can use the training data of label to be trained, the instruction of label
Practice data such as utilize the feature that the relationship metric (or distance) between two individuals represented from individual features vector marks to
Amount pair.For example, can be that a pair of of colleague generates corresponding feature vector pair.Feature vector is to the relationship between can using colleague
Some instructions mark, such as numerical value (for example, the scale of 0.0-1.0,0.0 represents immediate possible relationship (or distance),
1.0 represent irrelevant) or enumerate relationship (such as " lineal relative ", " extension family ", " spouse ", " offspring ", " siblings ",
" cousin ", " colleague ", " colleague " etc.), can be in this example " colleague ".The label is to together with any amount of
Other labels are carried out to can be used for relationship of the training machine Study strategies and methods between the feature vector pair to representing individual couple
Classification.In other embodiments, the feature of each feature vector can be embedded into embedded space, and can such as point of use
The determining feature such as product, cosine similarity, Euclidean distance is accordingly the distance between embedded.
However, determine the distance between feature vector, multiple feature vectors it is any it is given to the distance between can be with table
Show the relationship between two users of expression by given feature vector.Distance is nearer, and relationship is stronger, and vice versa.Assuming that
Represent the relationship between the feature vector of the first and second users by than another relationship between the first user and another user more
Short distance represents.It is further assumed that interactive assistant module has the license by the call diversion of other users to the first user.
In this case, interactive assistant module can speculate that it also has the license of switching second user.
In other embodiment, interactive assistant module can be come using the license for being granted to interactive assistant module
Comparison, to provide the access to the various resources by the first user's control to various users.For example, in some embodiments
In, interactive assistant module can identify the first set of one or more licenses associated with second user.First set
Each license interactive assistant module can be permitted to provide the access to the resource by the first user's control to second user.Separately
Outside, interactive assistant module can identify one or more one or more permitted associated with one or more other users
A additional aggregates.Each set in one or more additional aggregates can be with the different user in one or more other users
It is associated.In addition, each license of each additional aggregates can permit interactive assistant module to associated with additional aggregates
User provides the access to the resource by the first user's control.Then, interactive assistant module can be by first set and one
Or each set in multiple additional aggregates is compared.If the first set of license associated with second user is enough
It is similar to license in advance that another user of call diversion to the first user is associated to it with interactive assistant module
Sets of permissions, then interactive assistant module can speculate that it has the license to the first user by the call diversion of second user.
Fig. 5, which is depicted, to be shown for example by an example of the first movement phone 422A graphic user interfaces rendered
The example of the sets of permissions of two contact person Molly Simpson and the John Jones of the first user is gone out to authorize.At some
In embodiment, the first user can operate such graphic user interface to set the license of various contact persons, although this is not
It is required.In this example, interactive assistant module have to Molly Simpson provide to the contact person of the first user,
Local picture is (for example, be stored in the sheet of another equipment of the equipment ecosystem of first movement phone 422A and/or the first user
Image in ground memory) and the license of the access of picture (for example, the first user has been stored in the picture on cloud) online.Together
Sample, the interactive oriented John Jones of assistant module provide the access to the contact person of the first user, will come from John
The call diversion of Jones is provided to the first user, to John Jones to the schedule of the first user and to the first user's
Current state position (for example, by first movement phone 422A and/or by the first user's operation equipment the ecosystem it is another
The position coordinates sensor of equipment determines) access license.Certainly, the first user can have Fig. 4 in be not shown to its
Any amount of additional contacts of license；The contact person of description and associated license are for illustration purposes only.
Situation about being described about Fig. 4 is continued the above, when deciding whether that the incoming call by second user is transferred to the first use
During family, interactive assistant module can by its license to second user and its to including Molly Simpson and John
The license of each contact person of the first user of Jones compares.Assuming that sets of permissions associated with second user is most like
In sets of permissions associated with Molly Simpson (for example, the contact person to the first user, local can be provided to the two
With the access of online picture).Interactive assistant module does not have is transferred to first by the incoming call from Molly Simpson
The license of user.Therefore, interactive assistant module may will not speculate the license of the incoming call with switching second user.
It is assumed, however, that sets of permissions associated with second user is most similar to license collection associated with John Jones
It closes (for example, the access to the contact person of the first user, schedule and position can be provided to the two).Interactive assistant module is also
With the prior license that the incoming call from John Jones is transferred to the first user.Therefore, interactive assistant module
It can speculate the license of the incoming call with switching second user.
In some embodiments, can using machine learning techniques similar to above come determine the license of contact person it
Between " similitude ".It is, for example, possible to use the license of license such as shown in fig. 5 is vectorial to form above-mentioned contact feature.This
The distance between feature vectors can be by interactive assistant module (or by one with client device network communication or more
A Server remote) calculate, and for determining the similitude between contact person, and finally determine whether that license second is used
The incoming call at family is transferred to the first user.
In Figure 5, license associated with each contact person is typically to be awarded for these contact persons to interactive mode
The license of assistant module.However, this is not intended to limit.In some embodiments, license associated with contact person can
To include other kinds of license, license such as associated with third-party application.For example, in some embodiments, by joining
Be the license that people authorizes application, such as by bus sharing application (for example, access user current location), social networking application (for example,
License, the license for the photo for checking other side, the license of label other side etc. in photo etc. for accessing specific group or event) etc.,
It can be used for comparing contact person.In some embodiments, these other licenses can be used simply as with controlling user
Carry out the data point of contact person and/or Relationship Comparison.For example, when generating feature vector associated with each contact person with determining
As described above apart from when, can include third-party application permit as the feature in feature vector.
Interactive assistant module can determine whether to assume to provide to by controlling to request user using various other methods
The access permission of the resource of user's control processed.For example, in some embodiments, control user can establish (or interactive
Assistant module can establish via study is automatic at any time) multiple so-called " reliability ratings ".Each reliability rating can include
The sets of permissions that member's (that is, contact person of control user) set and interactive assistant have member.
Request user can be controlled use with relationship by the control user with meeting one or more criterion to obtain
The membership qualification of the given reliability rating at family.These criterion, which can include having with control user, adequately to be interacted, with enough
Amount shared content (for example, document, calendar), have number of thresholds shared social networking contacts, by control user
It is added manually to reliability rating, etc..When user is asked to ask to access the resource by control user's control, interactive assistant's mould
Block can determine that the interactive assistant module of (i) which reliability rating (if any) license provides the visit to requested resource
Ask and (ii) request user whether be any determining reliability rating member.It is determining as a result, interactive mode helps based on these
Manage the access that module can be to request user's offer to asked resource.
In some embodiments, reliability rating can be automatically determined.For example, the various features based on these contact persons
(for example, previously described license and other features), the various contact persons of specific user can cluster together, such as in insertion
In formula space.If sufficient amount of contact person be based on sharing feature cluster together, then reliability rating can automatically with this
Cluster correlation joins.It thus, for example, can be by the contact person with specific user with very substantial connection (for example, based on a large amount of phases
Like license etc.) it is grouped into the first cluster for representing "high" reliability rating.It is less close also not too important with specific user's relationship
Contact person can be grouped into expression " in " reliability rating second cluster.Other relatively weak connection with the relationship of specific user
It is the third cluster that people can be grouped into expression " low " reliability rating.Etc..
In some embodiments, the All Contacts that can be directed in the cluster assume to be awarded in specific cluster
In with threshold frequency find interactive assistant module license.For example, it is assumed that interactive assistant module has in high trust etc.
The current location of specific user is shared in grade with 75% contact person (license is not yet refused by remaining contact person of the cluster)
License.Interactive assistant can be assumed provide (according to request) to spy for the All Contacts in high reliability rating cluster
Determine the access of the current location of user.In various embodiments, specific user can for example using graphic user interface,
Contact person etc. is added or deletes in modification license associated with various reliability ratings from reliability rating.In some embodiments,
When specific user adds new contact person, interactive assistant module can determine that new contact person should using similar technology
Which cluster (and therefore reliability rating) be added to.In some embodiments, interactive assistant module can be to specific
New contact person is added to the suggestion of reliability rating rather than new contact person simply is automatically added to letter by user's prompting first
Appoint grade.In other embodiments, can online (on the fly) analysis request user, for example, they ask by controlling
During the resource of user's control processed, to determine suitable reliability rating.
Fig. 6 shows to be performed that interactive assistant module is permitted to carry first unnecessary by interactive assistant module
It is provided (in the case where needing or not needing to seek license) to request user to control user institute in the case of showing control user
The routine 650 of the access of the resource of control.Routine 650 can be by handling the same services based on speech polling or can be
Entirely different service execution.Although specific operation is described with particular order, but this does not imply that limitation.In various embodiment party
In formula, can add, omit or resequence one or more operations.
In block 658, interactive assistant module can receive the access to the resource controlled by second user from the first user
Request.For example, mobile phone in a call or can be placed in and " not beat in second user by the first user
Disturb " pattern when call try second user mobile phone.As another example, the first user can ask interactive assistant's mould
Block provides the access of content (photo, media, document etc.) to being controlled by second user.Additionally or alternatively, first
User can ask one or more attributes of the context of interactive assistant module's offer second user, such as current location, shape
State (for example, social network status) etc..
At block 660, interactive assistant module can determine the attribute of the first relationship between the first and second users.Perhaps
More example relationship attributes are possible, and including but not limited to those of foregoing description (help for example, authorizing interactive mode by second user
The license (or other General Licenses) of module is managed to provide the access of resource that is controlled second user to the first user), altogether
It enjoys the contact frequency (for example, by single-mode of such as phone or across various modes) between contact person, user, enumerate
Relationship classification (such as spouse, brother, friend, acquaintance, colleague etc.), between the first and second users (for example, their current locations
And/or between its family/work address) geographic distance, users to share document (for example, multiple documents, Doctype etc.),
Demographic similarity's (such as age, gender) etc..
In block 662, interactive assistant module can determine second user (that is, control user in the scene) with one or
One or more attributes of one or more relationships between multiple other users.It, can be by the attribute of the first relationship in block 664
It is compared, such as use various heuristics described above, machine learning with the attribute of other one or more relationships
Technology etc..For example, and as previously mentioned, insertion associated with various users can be determined in embedded space between
" distance ".
In block 666, interactive assistant module can with condition assume that the comparison based on block 664 is provided to the first user to institute
The license of the access of the resource of request.For example, it is assumed that the distance between first and second users are less than second user and another use
The distance between family, interactive assistant module have another user the license for authorizing the access to requested resource.
In this case, the first user can equally be authorized the access to requested resource by interactive assistant module.
In some embodiments, in block 668, interactive assistant module can determine whether requested resource is " high
Sensitivity " resource.If such as second user identifies resource so for certain, resource can be considered highly sensitive.Separately
Outside or as an alternative, interactive assistant module can check the past example of accessed resource and/or similar resource, with " study "
Whether resource has the acuity metric for meeting predetermined threshold.For example, if the automatic access authorized to specific resources is not (that is,
Need first obtain second user explicit license), and second user provide later instruction should not authorize it is this from
The feedback accessed is moved, then interactive assistant module can increase the sensitivity level of the specific resources.
As another example, the feature of requested resource can be with being known as other resources of high (or low) sensitivity
Feature is compared, to determine whether requested resource is highly sensitive.In some embodiments, machine learning model can
It is trained with training data with the resource characteristic including being marked with various sensitivity indexs.Machine learning model then can be with
The feature of unmarked resource is applied to, to determine its level of sensitivity.
In other embodiments, rule and/or heuristic may be used to determine the sensitivity of asked resource
Grade.For example, it is assumed that requested resource is comprising about the individual of second user and/or confidential information or allowing visit to it
The document asked or other resources, personal and/or confidential information address, Social Security Number, account information etc..In this feelings
Under condition, requested resource can be classified as high sensitivity by interactive assistant module, because it meets one or more rules.
Answer such as fruit block 668 is no (i.e. requested resource be not considered as high sensitivity), then method 650 can be with
Proceed to block 670.In block 670, interactive assistant module can provide the access to resource to the first (asking) user.Example
Such as, the call from the first user can be transferred to second user by interactive assistant module.Or interactive assistant's mould
Block can provide the requested information of position, state, the context of second user etc. to the first user.In some embodiment party
In formula, the first user can be allowed to change resource, such as add/change the calendar of second user, set for second user
Remind etc..
However, if the answer at fruit block 668 is is (i.e. requested resource is considered as high sensitivity), then method 650
It may proceed to block 672.Block 672, interactive assistant module can obtain to the first user and provide from the second (that is, control) user
License to the access of requested resource.In some embodiments, interactive assistant module can levy from second user
It asks and provides output on one or more of the client device ecosystem of the second user of license client device.For example,
Second user can be received on his or her smart phone pop-up notification, independent voice activation product (for example, intelligence
Loud speaker) or interior computing system on receive audible request, vision and/or audio request etc. received on smart television.It is false
Determine second user and authorize the license, then then method 650 may proceed to previously described piece 670.
