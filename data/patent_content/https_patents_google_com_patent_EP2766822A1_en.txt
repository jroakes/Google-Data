Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to the management of access to information technology assets.
- IT administrators have the task of managing and securing access to an organization's information. To fulfill this obligation, IT administrators manage accounts and passwords for their users, and manage their users' ability to access the organization's various IT systems and data repositories.
- predetermined conditions For example, companies may make sure that their employee's devices have secure access codes, encrypted file systems, and trusted application sandboxes in place before access to the organization's data is granted. Alternatively, IT administrators may prescribe approved configurations of hardware and software that have been tested for use in accessing the organization's data.
- this document describes systems and methods for managing applications that may be purchase or otherwise distributed through an application marketplace, portal or store, and installed on user devices.
- an IT administrator may publish a policy to an application marketplace to identify permissions that may be accessed or restricted from access by the application distributed through the application marketplace.
- the policy may further specify which applications may access, or may not access, data, functions or operations that are associated with user device permissions, such as a permission to access calendar data or contact data.
- a security application or module associated with the application marketplace determines whether the policy allows or disallows such access before allowing the application to be downloaded or installed.
- the policy (or particular restrictions defined by the policy) may be configured to apply to all user accounts associated with the user device, or to a particular subset of the user accounts.
- a "permission” refers to a restriction that limits or otherwise governs access to a part of the code, to data, or to functionality on a device. Permissions, which may be defined by an operating system of the device, may restrict read or write access to particular data, such as a contact database or an email database or, for example, may limit access to device hardware resources or communication resources. A permission may, for example, govern an ability of a user device to access data generated by a particular hardware module, to operate in a "roaming" mode, or to access a 4G network.
- Permissions are imposed to protect critical data and code that could be misused to distort or damage the user experience. Permissions are identified by a unique name or label, which often suggests the function that is restricted by the permission, and specify or define an association with the restricted code, data, or function.
- a method includes receiving, by one or more servers associated with an application marketplace, a policy that includes data that identifies one or more users, and a restricted permission.
- a request is received, by the servers associated with the application marketplace, to access one or more applications that are distributed through the application marketplace, wherein the request includes data that identifies a particular one of the users.
- One or more of the applications that are associated with the restricted permission are identified by the servers associated with the application marketplace, and access by the particular user to the applications that are associated with the restricted permission is restricted by the servers associated with the application marketplace.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems and computer program products.
- the policy can be received from a server associated with an information technology administrator.
- the policy can be received from a mobile device that is associated with the particular user.
- the policy can be stored in a collection of policies; and in response to receiving the request, the policy can be selected from among the policies stored in the collection, using the data in the request that identifies the particular user.
- restricting access to the applications that are associated with the restricted permission can include providing a user interface that identifies the applications that are associated with the restricted permission, and that includes, for each of the identified applications, an indicator that indicates that access to each of the applications that are associated with the restricted permission is restricted.
- the indicator can further indicate that each of the applications are distributable through the application marketplace regardless of the restricted permission, and the user interface comprises a user-selectable control for requesting distribution of one or more of the applications regardless of the restricted permission.
- the indicator that indicates that access to each of the applications is restricted can be provided in a portion of the user interface that would otherwise be used to provide a user-selectable control for requesting distribution of one or more of the
- the indicator that indicates that access to each of the applications is restricted can include a disabled control for requesting distribution of the applications.
- the user interface can comprise a user-selectable control for requesting moderation of the restricted permission.
- Restricting access to the applications that are associated with the restricted permission can include providing a user interface that identifies one or more applications that are not associated with the restricted permission, and that does not identify the applications that are associated with the restricted permission.
- Restricting access to the applications that are associated with the restricted permission can include providing a user interface that identifies the applications that are associated with the restricted permission, as restricted applications.
- providing the user interface that identifies the applications that are associated with the restricted permission can include greying out information that identifies the applications on the user interface. Identifying one or more of the applications that are associated with the restricted permission can include identifying one or more of the applications that perform one or more operations associated with the restricted permission. Identifying one or more of the applications that are associated with the restricted permission can include identifying one or more of the applications that declare use of the restricted permission.
- Restricting access to the applications that are associated with the restricted permission can include providing, by the servers associated with the application marketplace, indicia descriptive of each of the applications that are not associated with the restricted permission, and omitting indicia descriptive of each of the applications that are associated with the restricted permission.
- a system can restrict access to corporate data on a permission-by-permission basis, an application-by-application basis, and optionally an account-by-account basis, without overly restricting the user device's access to the rich marketplace of applications that are available for installation and use.

- FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram that shows an example system that implements permission-based administrative controls.
- the system 100 includes an administrator server 102, an application marketplace server 103, and a user device 104 that are connected by a network 130 .
- the administrator server 102 is a computer device that provides an administrator interface 106 for use by an employee that manages IT resources on behalf of an organization, e.g., an IT administrator.
- the network 130 includes a wired or wireless private network, e.g., a corporate local area network or intranet, a public network, e.g., the Internet, a cellular data network, or any other appropriate type of computer network.
- the user device 104 is a computing device that is used by the same or a different employee of the organization, and can be a smartphone, a traditional cellular telephone, a personal computer, a tablet computer, an e-book reader, a music player, or any other appropriate type of computing device.
- the user device 104 may be a dual use device, used by an owner of the device to serve both business and personal needs.
- the administrator interface 106 allows the IT administrator to configure settings that define a policy 107, which can at least partly determine the applications that the user device 104 is permitted to install.
- the IT administrator can use the administrator interface 106 to create the policy 107 that groups user domains, permissions, and applications, and/or that specifies a particular restriction for grouped permissions and applications.
- the policy 107 may restrict access to corporate data on a domain-by-domain, a permission-by-permission, and/or an application-by-application basis, without overly restricting the user device's access to the rich marketplace of applications that are available for installation and use.
- ⁇ contacts permission all applications ⁇ to allow all applications on the user device 104 to access functionality associated with a "contacts” permission
- ⁇ email permission application ABC ⁇ to only allow an application identified by the identifier "ABC” to access functionality associated with an "email” permission
- the policy 107 may specify a grouping to selectively allow, prevent, or alter the behavior or appearance of applications that are made available through the application marketplace 150 to selected users or groups of users.
- the administrator interface 106 shows that an administrator is creating the policy 107 that specifies a grouping such as ⁇ for all users within the "example.com” domain, "email data access” has been "disabled” ⁇ to cause applications that access email data as part of their functionality to be managed differently than unrestricted applications.
- the application marketplace server 103 may prevent such restricted applications from being presented in the application marketplace 150.
- the administrator interface 106 provides a user input control 108, a permission input control 1 10, and a restriction input control 1 12.
- the IT administrator enters data into the user input control 108 to identify a user or groups of users for whom the policy 107 will apply.
- the user(s) may be identified by user name (e.g., "Nate Godbout,” “ngodbout,” “nathan@example.com”), or user domain (e.g., "*. example. com,” “hr.example.com”).
- user name e.g., "Nate Godbout,” “ngodbout,” “nathan@example.com”
- user domain e.g., "*. example. com,” “hr.example.com”
- the identified user group is all users within the “example.com” domain.
- the IT administrator enters a permission name into the permission input control 1 10 to specify the permission whose associated functionality, data, operations, or resources the identified application is permitted to access, or is restricted from accessing.
- the IT administrator has identified the "access email data" permission.
- the permissions, and the code, data, or functionality associated with each permission may be predefined by an application, operating system, or file system of the user device 104.
- the IT administrator may manually configure permissions associated with the use of data repositories stored on or accessed by the user device 104, user device functions (e.g., microphone, location awareness, wireless connectivity), device capabilities (e.g., text messaging, data connectivity, cellular roaming), or other application or user device 104 features.
- user device functions e.g., microphone, location awareness, wireless connectivity
- device capabilities e.g., text messaging, data connectivity, cellular roaming
- administrator may use the administrator interface 106 to manually configure such permissions.
- the IT administrator enters data into the restriction input control 1 12 to identify the type of restriction that is to be associated with the application identified in the application input control 108.
- the restriction options may include "restrict,” “block,” “permit,” or “allow.”
- a “restrict” or “block” selection may result in an application being placed on a blacklist for an identified permission, or in the application being removed or omitted from a whitelist for the identified permission.
- a “permit” or “allow” selection may result in the application being placed on a whitelist for an identified permission, or in the application being removed or omitted from a whitelist for the identified permission.
- the IT administrator has selected to "disable” applications that are associated with an "access email data" permission.
- a restriction option is not specified by the IT administrator, and a default setting or a setting that is inherent to the type of permission is used.
- the IT administrator may instead specify, e.g., through a "seek approval" selection, that approval for an applications that "access email data" is to be sought when the user requests to download and install such an application.
- a request message may be sent across the network 130 from the application marketplace server 103 to the administrator server 102, and the IT administrator is presented with the option of allowing or disallowing the application from being downloaded and installed.
- the IT administrator selects an appropriate option, and an approval message or disapproval message is sent across the network 130 to the application marketplace server 103, and the user device 104 is allowed or disallowed to download and install the selected application based on the type or content of the message received by the application marketplace server 103.
- the administrator server 102 transmits the policy 107 identifying the specified user(s), restriction, and permission to the application marketplace server 103 through the network 130.
- the application marketplace server 103 stores the policy in a policy database.
- the policy database includes a data structure (e.g., a list) that identifies one or more policies, and a data structure that identifies one or more applications that may be available for download and installation on user devices.
- the policy list identifies policies that are to be applied to applications, and the application list identifies applications and the permissions associated with each respective application.
- the user interacts with the application marketplace 150 to send a request to the application marketplace sever 103 to browse an inventory of applications.
- the request includes an identifier 1 14 of the user domain associated with the user and/or the user device 104.
- the application marketplace server 103 selects applications that are responsive to the user's request. The application marketplace server 103 also determines that some of the applications requested for browsing are governed by one or more particular permissions.
- the application marketplace server 103 may determine that the user is requesting to browse "communication" applications (e.g., instant messenger clients, email clients, chat clients), and determines that among the inventory of "communication” applications available through the application marketplace server 103 are “communication” applications that have registered with the application marketplace server 103 that they utilize the "access email data" permission.
- “communication” applications e.g., instant messenger clients, email clients, chat clients
- the application marketplace server 103 sends information 1 16 that describes the selected applications back to the user device 104.
- the information 1 16 includes information that describes applications that are responsive to the user's request and are not restricted by policies, such as the policy 107, on the application marketplace server 103.
- the information 1 16 may omit descriptions of applications that have been restricted by policies on the application marketplace server 103.
- the information 1 16 may include descriptions of both allowed and restricted applications, as well as descriptions of the allowed and/or restricted statuses of the selected applications. For example, the information 1 16 may describe that an "application A" exists among the "communication" applications available through the application marketplace server 103, but that the "application A" is blocked from being downloaded and installed on the user device 104.
- the application marketplace 150 presents a display of the selected applications described by the information 1 16.
- the application marketplace 150 presents an application description 152 and an application description 154.
- the application descriptions 152, 154 describe (e.g., provide an application name, summary, screen shot, ratings information) the
- “application A” and an “application B” are both blocked from being downloaded and installed on the user device 104.
- “application A” and “application B” may both be email client applications, and as such both may use the "access email data" permission as part of their functionalities.
- the application descriptions 152, 154 both include an indicator 156 that the described applications have been blocked from being downloaded and installed on the user device 104.
- the application descriptions 152, 154 both also include a user control 158 that the user can activate to obtain more information about why the respective application has been blocked. For example, the user may click on one of the user controls 158 and in response, the application marketplace 150 may present an explanation that the corresponding application has been blocked because users who belong to the "example.com" domain are restricted from using applications that utilize the "access email data" permission.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart that shows an example process 200 for controlling access to applications.
- the process 200 can be performed by the application marketplace server 103 of FIG. 1 .
- a policy that includes data that identifies (i) one or more users and (ii) a restricted permission is received from over a network and by one or more servers associated with an application marketplace.
- the policy may be received from a server associated with an information technology administrator.
- the policy may be received from a mobile device that is associated with the particular user.
- the policy 107 may be provided to the application marketplace server 103 by the user device 104.
- a request to access one or more applications that are distributed through the application marketplace is received by the servers associated with the application marketplace, wherein the request includes data that identifies a particular one of the users.
- the user interacts with the application marketplace 150 to send the request to the application marketplace sever 103 to browse the inventory of applications.
- the request includes the identifier 1 14 of the user domain associated with the user and/or the user device 104.
- identifying one or more of the applications that are associated with the restricted permission can include identifying one or more of the applications that perform one or more operations associated with the restricted permission.
- the applications "A" and "B" described by the application descriptions 152 and 154 may perform operations that access email information, and are therefore restricted by the policy 107 that indicates that access to email data has been disabled for all users of the "example.com" domain.
- identifying one or more of the applications that are associated with the restricted permission may include identifying one or more of the applications that declare use of the restricted permission.
- the applications "A" and "B" described by the application descriptions 152 and 154 may declare their use of access to email data explicitly such as through a permission requirement manifest or through reflected metadata, or implicitly such as by being examined in an application "sandbox" provided by the application marketplace server, in which the application may be installed in a simulated deployment environment to detect the functions and resources that the application may attempt to access during execution.
- one or more of the applications that are associated with the restricted permission are identified by the servers associated with the application marketplace. For example, during state (d), the application marketplace server 103 selects the group of applications that are responsive to the user's request, and also determines that some of the applications requested for browsing are governed by one or more particular permissions. [0048] At step 240, access by the particular user to the applications that are associated with the restricted permission is restricted by the servers associated with the application marketplace. For example, in states (e) and (f), the application marketplace server 103 provides the information 1 16 that includes information that describes applications that are responsive to the user's request. In some
- the user interface may identify the applications that are associated with the restricted permission, as restricted applications.
- the application descriptions 152 and 154 include the indicators 156 that indicate that application "A” and application "B" have been "blocked”.
- the user interface may identify one or more applications that are not associated with the restricted permission, and may not identify the applications that are associated with the restricted permission.
- the application marketplace 150 may show application descriptions for applications that are available for download and installation on the user device 104, and omit application descriptions for blocked applications.
- a user interface can be provided that identifies the applications that are associated with the restricted permission, and that includes indicia that specifies that access to each of the applications that are associated with the restricted permission is restricted.
- the application marketplace 150 is a user interface that displays the application descriptions 152 and 154, and includes the indicators 156 to indicate that the application descriptions 152 and 154 have been blocked for download and installation on the user device 104.
- the indicator that indicate that access to each of the applications is restricted may be provided in a portion of the user interface that would otherwise be used to provide a user-selectable control for requesting distribution of one or more of the applications.
- the indicators 156 may replace user controls that can be activated to download and install an unrestricted application (e.g., an "Install" button).
- the indicator that indicate that access to each of the applications is restricted may include a disabled control for requesting distribution of the applications.
- the application description 152 may include an "install" button that is grayed out and/or has otherwise been made visibly distinct to indicate the unavailability of the associated application. In other examples, the entire application description 152 may be grayed out and/or otherwise made visible distinct indicate the unavailability of the associated application.
- the user interface can include a user-selectable control for requesting moderation of the restricted permission.
- the application description 152 may include a button that lets the user request access to application "A".
- the request may be sent to the administrator server 102, or may be relayed to the administrator server 102 by the application marketplace server 103.
- the administrator may receive the request, and respond by creating or modifying a policy that would allow the requested application "A" to be deployed and installed on the user device 104.
- the servers associated with the application marketplace may provide indicia descriptive of each of the applications that are not associated with the restricted permission, and omitting indicia descriptive of each of the applications that are associated with the restricted permission.
- the application marketplace server 103 may search for and return to the application marketplace 150 application descriptions for applications that the user is allowed to install, and omit results that describe applications that have been blocked for the user.
- FIGs. 3A-3I show example screen shots 300a-300i of user interfaces for application marketplace that control access to applications.
- the screen shots 300a-300f may be views of the application marketplace 150 of FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 3A shows the example screen shot 300a.
- the screen shot 300a shows an application description 302 and an application description 304.
- the application description 304 includes a user control 306 that, when activated, will initiate the download and installation of the associated application "B" on a user device such as the user device 104.
- the application "A" represented by the application description 302 has been restricted by an application marketplace server such as the application marketplace server 103.
- the application description 302 includes an indicator 308 that indicates that the application "A” has been blocked.
- the indicator 308 replaces a user control, such as the user control 306, that would otherwise allow the installation of the application associated with the application description 302.
- FIG. 3B shows the example screen shot 300b.
- the screen shot 300b shows the application description 304 and an application description 310.
- the application description 310 describes the application "A", which has been restricted by the application marketplace server.
- the application description 310 is grayed out to indicate the restricted status of the application "A".
- graying out of an application description such as the application description 310 may include altering the color saturation, transparency, opacity, brightness, contrast, z-order depth, color scheme, or combinations of these and/or other appropriate visual attributes of the application description.
- FIG. 3C shows the example screen shot 300c.
- the screen shot 300c shows an application description 312.
- the application description 312 includes a warning indicator 314 that warns that the functionality of application "A" has been restricted by an administrator.
- the application description 312 also includes a user control 316 that, when activated, initializes the download and installation of the associated application.
- the user control 316 can allow the user to install an application despite the fact that some or all functions of the application may be restricted.
- application "A” may be a navigation application that provides a way to email the user's location to others.
- the user may still be able to install the application in order to use its navigation functions, but would be blocked from using the application's position emailing functions. Since the user would have previously seen the warning provided by the warning indicator 314, the user may experience less confusion or frustration over the blocked functionality than he or she may otherwise experience without being so forewarned.
- FIG. 3D shows the example screen shot 300d.
- the screen shot 300d shows an application description 320, an application description 322, and an application description 324.
- the application description 320 describes the allowed application "A”
- the application description 322 describes the blocked application "B”
- the application description 324 describes an allowed application "C”.
- the presentation of the application descriptions 320-324 is arranged in a modified alphabetical order. For example, without modification of the alphabetical presentation order, the application description 322 of the blocked application "B" would be displayed between the application descriptions 320 and 324.
- the alphabetical presentation order has been modified to rank and present the application descriptions 320 and 324 of the allowed applications "A” and “C” first, and to rank and present the application descriptions of blocked applications (e.g., the application description 322 of blocked application "B") lower than those of allowed applications.
- FIG. 3E shows the example screen shot 300e.
- the screen shot 300e shows an application description 330, an application description 332, and an application description 334.
- the application description 330 describes the allowed application "A”
- the application description 332 describes the blocked application “B”
- the application description 334 describes the allowed application "C”.
- the application descriptions 330 and 334 of the allowed applications "A” and “C” are included in a visibly distinct area 336.
- the application description 332 of the blocked application "B” is included in a visibly distinct area 338.
- the visibly distinct area 336 provides one or more visual cues that identify that the application descriptions 330 and 334 included within it describe applications that the user may download and install.
- the visibly distinct area 338 provides one or more visual cues that identify that the application description 332 included within it describes an application that is blocked for the user.
- FIG. 3F shows the example screen shot 300f.
- the screen shot 300f shows an application description 340, and an application description 342.
- the application description 340 describes the allowed application "A”
- the application description 342 describes the allowed application "C”.
- five other applications and their corresponding application descriptions have been blocked.
- the blocked applications are indicated by a blocked application summary 344.
- the blocked application summary 344 can inform the user that one or more applications have been blocked from the user and present such information substantially without consuming as much screen space as would be required to display application descriptions for each blocked application separately.
- the blocked application summary 344 includes a user control 346.
- the user control 346 when activated by the user, causes the blocked applications it describes to be presented. For example, the user may click the user control 346, and in response the screen shot 300f may be updated to resemble the screen shot 300d or the screen shot 300e.
- FIG. 3G shows the example screen shot 300g.
- the screen shot 300g shows an application description 350 for the application "A".
- the application description 350 includes an indicator 352 to indicate that application "A" has been blocked by the application marketplace server.
- a user control 354 when activated, causes additional information regarding the reason(s) why the associated application is restricted from the user. For example, the user may click the user control 354 to see a screen that displays information such as the privileges that have been restricted, the identity of the administrator or administrative authority that has restricted the privileges, the identity of scope of users who are affected by the restriction, and/or combinations of these and other appropriate information.
- the application description 350 includes a user control 356.
- the user control 356 when activated by the user, causes a request for approval for the application "A" to be sent. For example, the application “A” may have been blocked in the past because the application "A” required access to a sensitive function, but that requirement has since been removed. By clicking the user control 356, the user may draw an administrator's attention to the application “A” to re-evaluate and possibly unblock the application "A” so the user can download and install it.
- FIG. 3H shows the example screen shot 300h.
- the screen shot 300h shows an application description 360 for the application "A”, and an application description 362 for an application “C".

- the application description for the application "B” is omitted at the location 364.
- FIG. 31 shows the example screen shot 300i.
- the screen shot 300i presents a collection 370 of application descriptions for applications that are associated with a selected application category 372 (e.g., email applications).
- An application description 374 for the application "A” includes a user control 376.
- the user control 376 when selected by the user, initiates a request to be sent to the application marketplace server for the download and installation of application "A”.
- an application description 378 for the application "C” includes a user control 380.
- the user control 380 when selected by the user, initiates a request to be sent to the application marketplace server for the download and installation of application "C”.

- the application marketplace server has restricted the application “B”.
- the indicator 384 provides a visual notification that the application "B” described by the application description 382 has been blocked by the application marketplace server for download and installation by the user.
- FIG. 4 is a timeline diagram 400 that shows example interactions among systems for controlling access to application marketplace applications.
- the interactions occur among an administrator server 402, a user device 404, and an application marketplace server 406.
- the administrator server 402 may be the administrator server 102 of FIG. 1
- the user device 404 may be the user device 104
- the application marketplace server 406 may be the application marketplace server 103.
- the interactions begin at 410 when the administrator server 402 sends policy information to the application marketplace server 406.
- the policy information can be the policy 107 of FIG. 1 .
- the policy information describes users and privileges that an administrator has chosen to allow or disallow for the selected users.
- the policy information may express that all users of the "area51 .gov" domain are blocked from using the camera functions of the user device 404.
- the user device 404 sends a request to the application
- the request may be a request for information about a collection of applications for display in an application
- the request may be a request to download and/or install a selected application.
- the application or applications requested by the user device 404 have been restricted by the policy sent at 410.
- the application marketplace server 406 therefore sends denial information to the user device 404 at 414.
- the user device 404 sends a moderation request to the application marketplace server 406.
- the application marketplace server 406 forwards the moderation request to the administrator server 402.
- the moderation request is a request for an administrator of the administrator server 402 to review and possibly modify existing policies regarding privilege restrictions.
- the user of the user device 404 may believe that the requested application has been blocked by a policy that is overly broad, and send the request in an attempt to have the policy reviewed and updated to allow the installation of a selected application or category of applications.
- the user may send the request to obtain an individual or group exemption from one or more policies. For example, users belonging to the group "generals. area51 .gov” may be allowed to install applications that access camera functions, while all other users of "area51 .gov" remain blocked (e.g., "privates. area51 .gov").
- the user may request that an exemption be made for a particular application.
- the administrator may only allow "white-listed” (e.g., tested, trusted, approved) email applications to access email data on corporate user devices (e.g., to prevent malicious or poorly written applications from accessing sensitive data), and as such when a new email application appears in the application marketplace, it too is blocked by the existing policy.
- the user may send the request in an attempt to have the administrator review and/or add the new application to the "white list" of allowed applications.
- a moderation result is sent to the application marketplace server 406.
- the moderation result can include policy information that reflects the administrator's dispensation of the moderation request. For example, the administrator may update a policy to unblock selected permissions, may create a new policy to exempt selected users and/or applications from a restriction, may deny the request, and combinations of these and other appropriate responses to the moderation request. In some implementations, the administrator may simply ignore the moderation request. As such, the existing policies may remain unchanged and the application marketplace server 406 may treat the lack of response substantially the same as a denial of the moderation request.
- the moderation result is sent to the user device 402.
- the moderation result may indicate that the administrator has changed one or more policies in order to allow the download and installation of an application that was previous blocked for the user on the user device 404.
- a response to the moderation is sent from the user device 404 to the application marketplace server 406.
- the user may again attempt to download and install an application that was previously blocked, but is now allowed as a result of the moderation.
- installation information is sent from the application marketplace server 406 to the user device 404.
- the installation information may be an application description, or it may be installable application program code.
- FIG. 5 is a timeline diagram 500 that shows example interactions among systems for synchronizing policies for controlling access to application marketplace applications.
- the interactions occur among an administrator server 502, a user device 504, and an application marketplace server 506.
- the administrator server 502 may be the administrator server 102 of FIG. 1 or the administrator server 402 of FIG. 4
- the user device 504 may be the user device 104 or 404
- the application marketplace server 506 may be the application marketplace server 103 or 506.
- the administrator server 502 sends a policy "A" to the user device 504.
- the policy "A” includes information that describes privileges that have been restricted for applications running on the user device 504. For example, an administrator may push or otherwise install a policy description file on the user device 504 to cause the user device 504 to allow or prevent applications from accessing selected functions of the user device 504.
- the administrator server 502 sends a policy "B" to the application marketplace server 506.
- the policy "B” includes information that describes privileges that have been restricted for applications running on the user device 504.
- the policy “B” may direct the application marketplace server 506 to selectively allow or block applications that utilize selected functions of selected users' user devices.
- policy "A” may be different from policy "B".
- policy "A” may grant a selected permission while policy “B” restricts it.
- the user device sends a policy request to the application marketplace server 506.
- the request includes the policy "A”.
- the policy request is a request for the application marketplace server 506 to synchronize or otherwise update the policy information present on the user device 504. For example, the administrator may have blocked a selected function in policy "A”, but later decided to allow the functionality in policy "B”. By requesting the application marketplace server 506 to synchronize policy "A” and policy "B", the policies on the user device 504 may be updated to reflect current
- the application marketplace server 506 performs a policy synchronization operation.
- the policy synchronization operation may favor the most recent policy restrictions. For example, if policy "B" is more recent than policy "A", then the settings provided by policy “B” may be implemented for settings that are also found in policy "A”. In some implementations, the policy synchronization operation may favor the most restrictive policy restrictions. For example, if policy "A” restricts a privilege that policy "B” allows, then the settings provided by policy “A” may be implemented for settings that are also found in policy "B”.
- the application marketplace server 506 sends a response to the user device 504.
- the response includes information that describes the synchronized or otherwise updated policies that are to be applied to applications operating on the user device 504.
- the application marketplace server 506 sends policy
- the application marketplace server 506 may report conflicts that were determined to exist between policy "A" and policy "B".
- the administrator may use such information to update or otherwise modify permission policies for the user device 504 and/or the application marketplace server 506, or the administrator may be prompted to perform administrative actions directly upon the user device 504.
