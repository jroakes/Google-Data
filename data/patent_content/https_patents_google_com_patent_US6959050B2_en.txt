Definitions
- This invention relates to communication systems, including but not limited to synchronization of received signals.
- the synchronization (sync) process includes frequency synchronization and timing synchronization.
- Frequency synchronization involves measuring and compensating for the difference in frequency between the transmitting hardware's oscillator and the receiving hardware's oscillator.
- Timing synchronization involves adjusting the receiver's decimation phase such that the ensuing demodulation process occurs at prespecified baud boundaries. Improper frequency synchronization results in a frequency offset in the received signal, while improper timing synchronization may result in intersymbol interference (ISI). In either case, large errors in synchronization may lead to unreliable and poor quality communications.
- ISI intersymbol interference
- achieving proper synchronization is fairly straightforward and many solutions exist.
- OFDM orthogonal frequency division multiplexed
- achieving accurate synchronization is more critical because synchronization errors may lead to not only ISI, but also inter-carrier interference (ICI).
- ICI inter-carrier interference
- OFDM systems utilize a guard interval in order to combat ISI due to channel multipath distortion, the guard interval may lead to ambiguity in the timing synchronization process.
- a guard interval consists of a cyclic extension of an OFDM baud and is intended to absorb the multipath distortion in the channel and provide for one or more ISI-free sampling points.
- the receiver may adjust its decimation phase, allowing any samples in the original baud corrupted by ISI to be “replaced” by samples in the guard interval during demodulation. Baud boundary ambiguity arises because of the possible presence of more than one ISI-free sampling point. Adjusting the decimation phase to include samples from the guard interval may lead to phase rotation between successive OFDM subcarriers after demodulation, i.e., a subcarrier rotation offset. If ignored, this sampling phase-induced subcarrier rotation may cause channel estimation problems.

- Timing and fractional subcarrier frequency synchronization may be obtained from either a known or unknown (e.g., data symbol) baud exhibiting known symmetry properties. Because all three synchronization tasks may be accomplished utilizing a single sync baud, the present invention spectrally efficient.
- a differential correlation metric is utilized to efficiently provide integer subcarrier frequency synchronization and per-subcarrier rotation synchronization.
- FIG. 1 An example frequency-timing diagram of an OFDM signal structure is shown in FIG. 1 .
- the OFDM signal is comprised of L subcarriers.
- a potentially different complex symbol may be represented on each of the L subcarriers during each OFDM symbol period or baud.

- subcarrier rotation is estimated and applied to the received signal.
- a block diagram of a synchronizer is shown in FIG. 3 .
- the synchronizer 300 is part of a receiver, determines synchronization information (among other functions), and may be summarized as follows.
- a received signal including a sync baud that has been analog-to-digital (A/D) converted is input to a symbol timing synchronizer 301 .
- the sync baud is a baud that preferably has known time-domain symmetry properties, as will be described later.
- the symbol timing synchronizer 301 determines the timing offset based on application of a timing correlation metric P(d) to the received signal and removes the timing offset from the received signal.
- the resultant signal is passed to a fractional subcarrier frequency synchronizer 303 that determines a fractional subcarrier frequency offset, i.e., the frequency offset of the received signal projected to the nearest subcarrier.
- the fractional subcarrier frequency offset is removed from the received signal, the signal is serial-to-parallel (S/P) converted in the serial-to-parallel converter 305 as appropriate and, optionally, the cyclic extension is discarded if one was transmitted, and the result is sent to a Fourier transformer 307 that performs a Fourier transform, such as a discrete fourier transform (DFT) or fast Fourier transform (FFT) that converts the received signal from the time domain to the frequency domain.
- DFT discrete fourier transform
- FFT fast Fourier transform
- the frequency domain signal is sent to an integer subcarrier frequency synchronizer 309 that determines the integer subcarrier frequency offset that is an integer number of subcarrier multiples and removes the integer subcarrier frequency offset from the received signal.
- the removal of the integer subcarrier frequency offset may be accomplished by adding the integer offset to the indices of the FFT output.
- the result may be input to a per-subcarrier rotation synchronizer 311 that determines and removes per-subcarrier phase rotation from the received signal (the per-subcarrier rotation is the portion of the phase change or phase offset per subcarrier that is not caused by the symbol values on the subcarriers), by utilizing the correlation metrics from the integer subcarrier frequency synchronizer 309 and the timing correlation metric P(d) from the symbol timing synchronizer 301 , and outputs synchronized symbols.
- the integer subcarrier frequency offset is 1 (or 9 kHz) and the fractional subcarrier frequency offset is 0.25 (or 2.25 kHz).
- timing synchronization After the values for timing synchronization, fractional subcarrier frequency synchronization, integer subcarrier frequency synchronization, and subcarrier rotation, i.e., synchronization information, have been determined based on the sync baud, these values may be used to provide synchronized output symbols in subsequently received bauds, which may be passed to a data symbol detector. Any or all of the synchronization information may be utilized to update previously determined synchronization information. For example, for a particular sync baud, it may be advantageous to update only timing synchronization information, or fractional subcarrier frequency synchronization and integer subcarrier frequency synchronization, or even all of the synchronization information. For example, previously determined information may be combined with current information to determine a one or more pieces of synchronization information, or previously determined information may be used as a starting point to determine one or more pieces of current synchronization information.
- the sync baud When the sync baud is comprised of known symbols, such as when the sync baud is a training baud, the known symbols may be used to estimate the complex channel gain on the OFDM subcarriers.
- the complex channel gains may be used by the detector to correct for the complex channel gain before detecting the data symbols.
- the synchronizer 300 requires only a single sync baud with known time-domain symmetry properties to acquire timing sync and fractional subcarrier frequency sync, and may also acquire timing sync, frequency sync, and subcarrier rotation sync when the sync baud is a training baud.
- the sync baud is a training baud
- the sync baud includes known symbols on certain subcarriers and null symbols on other subcarriers (i.e., unused or zero-valued subcarriers).

- the sync baud may include unknown (such as data) symbols on certain subcarriers, known symbols on certain other subcarriers, and null symbols on other subcarriers (i.e., unused or zero-valued subcarriers).

- a single sync baud 401 is shown with a box representing each separate subcarrier's symbol as frequency varies in the vertical direction.
- the sync baud 401 is transmitted across one time period of L samples, where L is the IFFT (Inverse Fast Fourier Transform) size or length, in each of the subcarrier frequency slots, or one column of FIG. 1 .
- the single sync baud 401 is located, for example, at the beginning of each transmitted signal frame, although the sync baud may be located in a different part of the frame.
- every other subcarrier transmits a null or zero symbol (illustrated as an empty box), e.g., a sequence of preferably known symbols is transmitted on the even-numbered OFDM subcarriers and null symbols are transmitted on the odd-numbered OFDM subcarriers.
- the known symbols may be transmitted at double power to maintain the same overall average transmit power across the transmitted signal. Some of the known symbols may also be set to zero without disturbing the symmetry properties. For example, OFDM subcarriers near the edges of the allowed channel bandwidth may be set to zero to ease analog filtering constraints, as is known in the art.
- Each subcarrier symbol is sent in parallel to an inverse FFT 403 that outputs its result to a parallel-to-serial converter 405 .
- a guard interval or cyclic extension may be applied to the signal prior to the parallel to serial conversion process.
- the output of the parallel-to-serial converter 405 is digital-to-analog (D/A) converted, yielding a half-symbol symmetric signal (excluding the cyclic extension, if any), i.e., a waveform comprising two substantially identical versions of the same signal each with period L/2 due to only one-half of the subcarriers transmitting a signal.
- the analog signal is transmitted.
- FIG. 5 A diagram of a modulator that transmits a sync baud that exhibits (1/N)-symbol symmetry is shown in FIG. 5.

- the single sync baud 501 is located, for example, at the beginning of each transmitted signal frame, although the sync baud may be located in a different part of the frame.
- a symbol is transmitted on every Nth subcarrier and a null or zero symbol (illustrated as an empty box) is transmitted on the remaining subcarriers, i.e., a sequence of preferably known symbols is transmitted on every Nth OFDM subcarrier and null symbols are transmitted on the remaining OFDM subcarriers.
- the known symbols may be transmitted at N times the power to maintain the same average transmit power for the transmitted signal. Some of the known symbols may also be set to zero without disturbing the symmetry properties. For example, OFDM subcarriers near the edges of the allowed channel bandwidth may be set to zero to ease analog filtering constraints, as is known in the art.
- Each subcarrier symbol is sent in parallel to an L-point inverse FFT 503 that outputs its result to a parallel-to-serial converter 505 .
- a guard interval or cyclic extension may be applied to the signal prior to the parallel to serial conversion process.
- the output of the parallel-to-serial converter 505 is D/A converted, yielding a (1/N)-symbol symmetric signal (excluding the cyclic extension, if any), i.e., a waveform comprising N substantially identical versions of the same signal each with period L/N due to 1/N of the subcarriers transmitting a signal.
- the analog signal is transmitted.
- the known symbols of the sync baud are assumed to be placed on every Nth input to the IFFT in such a way that one of the known symbols is placed on the DC or 0 Hz subcarrier in complex baseband representation.
- the invention is also applicable when the known symbols of the sync baud are mapped to every Nth subcarrier in a different way. A different mapping than the one described above causes a known sequence of phase shifts between the symmetric portions of the sync baud.
- the second half of the time-domain sync baud waveform will have a phase shift of 180 degrees compared to the first half. Because the phase shift of the second half is predetermined or known, the second half is still considered to be symmetric to the first half.

- a receiver receives the transmitted analog signal and A/D converts it.
- the resultant received signal is then appropriately processed to obtain timing, frequency, and preferably per-subcarrier rotation sync.
- the following example shows determination of timing sync, frequency sync, and per-subcarrier rotation sync, in that order, for an embodiment where the sync baud is a training baud.
- the steps for timing sync and fractional frequency sync are the same as for an embodiment where the sync baud is a training baud.
- Timing sync is obtained by the symbol timing synchronizer 301 .
- the present invention may be utilized in both a sync acquisition state and a sync tracking or maintenance state.
- the sync baud is found when
- Correlation metric equations that are defined differently than the equations given for P(d) herein may also be used without departing from the scope of the invention.
- Those skilled in the art may consider different forms of correlations metrics. Examples of different forms of correlation metric include, but are not limited to the following.
- the summations over m imply a rectangular processing window.
- the rectangular window may be replaced with a different type of window, such as a recursive exponentially decaying window.
- a different type of normalization of the correlation metric may be used, i.e., the denominator may be modified. It is also possible to eliminate the normalization of the metric, i.e., by setting the denominator to one, although this elimination causes the correlation magnitude to be dependent on the received signal power.
- the correlation metric may be modified to also include correlations between the non-adjacent symmetric portions, such as: first and fourth, first and third, second and fourth. This modification may improve the robustness of the correlation metric to channel noise.
- calculating the numerator of P(d) is similar to performing differential demodulation on samples spaced by L/N and integrating the differential demodulator output over a length L/N rectangular window.
- the valid region of the correlation function will look more like a “plateau” than a single spike.
- the effects of a constant channel phase cancel when correlating the N segments of the baud, at the proper decimation phase, the only phase shift between the N segments of the baud results from a frequency offset. Because of the nature of fixed frequency offsets, samples separated by a constant time period have a constant phase shift between them. Taking the magnitude of the metric eliminates the effect of frequency offset on timing synchronization.
- the fractional subcarrier frequency synchronizer 303 determines the fractional subcarrier frequency offset and removes it from the received signal.
- the timing correlation metric, P(d) may be viewed as the integral of a differential demodulator's output.
- the phase of the correlation metric is equal to the signal's average rotation over a length L/N time interval, which, in turn, is directly related to the underlying fractional subcarrier frequency offset.
- ⁇ 1 does not estimate the integer part of the frequency offset when the frequency offset is greater than N/2 subcarriers. Correcting a received signal by ⁇ 1 Hz, however, ensures that the frequency offset remaining in the signal is an integer multiple of the subcarrier spacing.
- the fractional subcarrier frequency synchronizer 303 removes the fractional subcarrier frequency offset ⁇ 1 from the received signal. The remaining integer part of the frequency offset may be removed by the integer subcarrier frequency synchronizer 309 , as will be described later.
- the present invention provides for the ability to determine timing sync and fractional subcarrier frequency offset from either a known sync baud (training baud) or an unknown sync baud, such as a data baud with certain subcarriers set to zero.
- timing and fractional subcarrier frequency offset sync may be obtained and/or periodically checked on any transmitted baud having 1/N symmetry.
- the fast Fourier transformer 307 transforms the sync baud by performing an FFT on the received signal, excluding any cyclic extension, as known in the art.
- the integer subcarrier frequency synchronizer 309 measures the remaining or integer subcarrier frequency offset.
- the integer subcarrier frequency synchronizer 309 determines the integer subcarrier frequency offset without requiring a second sync baud to be transmitted, thereby utilizing better spectral efficiency than prior methods that transmit two training bauds for synchronization.
- the integer subcarrier frequency synchronizer 309 utilizes a differential correlation metric.
- the differential correlation metric compares the known changes between non-zero subcarrier symbols to the changes observed between non-zero subcarrier symbols from the received sync baud.
- FIG. 6 A diagram showing differential correlation for a sync baud that exhibits half-symbol symmetry is shown in FIG. 6 .
- the sync baud is a training baud comprised of known symbols transmitted on even subcarriers and null symbols transmitted on odd subcarriers.
- the differential correlation metric is illustrated in FIG. 6 .
- the complex conjugate of a known symbol 401 is multiplied by a symbol from a shifted version of the FFT output 601 .
- the correlation may also be performed by shifting the known symbols instead of the FFT output symbols. For the positions where the sync baud symbols are zero, the result of the multiplication is also zero.
- the results may be placed into a “baud” 603 that has zeros on every other subcarrier. Consecutive non-null symbols in the resultant baud 603 are multiplied together, i.e., the null subcarriers are skipped, with one as complex conjugate, and the result is added, yielding R(s).
- the effects of a constant channel phase cancel when correlating differentially in frequency. Therefore, at the appropriate subcarrier offset, s rem , any phase shift remaining in the differential correlation metric may be attributed to sampling phase induced subcarrier rotation. Taking the magnitude of the differential correlation metric isolates the frequency synchronization process from the effects of subcarrier rotation.
- the present invention provides the ability to determine the integer subcarrier frequency offset using only a single sync baud.

For the positions where the sync baud symbols are zero, the result of the multiplication is also zero. After all sync baud symbols have been multiplied by the corresponding symbol from the shifted FFT output, the results may be placed into a “baud” 703 that has zeros on two of every three subcarriers.
- Consecutive non-null symbols in the resultant baud 703 are multiplied together, i.e., the null subcarriers are skipped, with one as complex conjugate, and the result is added, yielding R(s).

- Timing correlations that search for a baud with N identical segments need only be performed over a small region near the current decimation phase and only while a sync baud is received. Moreover, assuming minimal oscillator drift and a fairly constant channel, only the fractional subcarrier frequency correction involving the angle of the timing correlation metric need be performed, and the more computationally intensive post-FFT-correlation may be avoided. When the post-FFT-correlation is needed, a subset of the subcarriers may be used to compute the integer subcarrier frequency offset and the per-subcarrier rotation phase.
- the present invention provides a number of advantages over prior OFDM sync methods.
- the present invention is spectrally efficient, i.e., has low overhead. Unlike prior art synchronization methods that require two or more OFDM training bauds, the present invention utilizes at most one OFDM sync baud. Moreover, by replacing some of the known symbols in the sync baud with random data symbols, this overhead may be further reduced.
- the initial (1/N)-symbol timing correlation process looks for a baud whose N segments are identical because only every Nth subcarrier contains a non-zero symbol. Whether these symbols consist of known symbols or random data symbols has no impact on this process.
- the present method accomplishes all three stages of synchronization: timing, frequency and subcarrier (or per-subcarrier) rotation.
- Many prior OFDM synchronization methods do not address per-subcarrier rotation.
- the present invention does not suffer from channel estimation problems that may result from neglecting the per-subcarrier rotation.
- the present invention is not computationally complicated.
- the present invention may use the discrete fourier transform (DFT) or similar transforms in place of the FFT if needed.
- DFT discrete fourier transform
Abstract
Description
the known symbols are placed on the subcarriers i=0, i=N, i=2N, and so on. The invention is also applicable when the known symbols of the sync baud are mapped to every Nth subcarrier in a different way. A different mapping than the one described above causes a known sequence of phase shifts between the symmetric portions of the sync baud. Those skilled in the art may modify the equations provided in the preferred embodiment to account for the phase shifts. For example, if N=2 and the known symbols are mapped to i=1, i=N+1, i=2N+1, and so on, then the second half of the time-domain sync baud waveform will have a phase shift of 180 degrees compared to the first half. Because the phase shift of the second half is predetermined or known, the second half is still considered to be symmetric to the first half.

where r is a received sample (after A/D conversion and before FFT), and d is the time index. For the general case where N is an integer greater than one, a correlation metric may be computed as
which may be viewed as a scaled sum of correlations between the symmetric parts of the sync baud. For example, the first term (k=0) includes the correlation between the first and second symmetric portions. The next term includes the correlation between the second and third symmetric portions, and so on.
where Δf is the subcarrier spacing in Hz. As mentioned earlier, the timing correlation metric, P(d), may be viewed as the integral of a differential demodulator's output. Therefore, the phase of the correlation metric is equal to the signal's average rotation over a length L/N time interval, which, in turn, is directly related to the underlying fractional subcarrier frequency offset. Because of the inherent aliasing in computing angles, γ1 does not estimate the integer part of the frequency offset when the frequency offset is greater than N/2 subcarriers. Correcting a received signal by −γ1 Hz, however, ensures that the frequency offset remaining in the signal is an integer multiple of the subcarrier spacing. The fractional

In order to determine which solution yields the true per-subcarrier rotation, the original symbol timing correlation function, P(d), is utilized to check for the beginning of the non-extended portion of the OFDM baud. The values comprising P(d) do not need to be recalculated because they were computed earlier as part of the initial timing sync process from

prior to the chosen decimation point is the beginning of the baud when φ=φ−. Thus, the timing correlation metric is utilized to find the per-subcarrier rotation offset φ. When the overall length of the guard interval is less than half the baud length (which is normally the case in OFDM systems), only one of the possible baud beginnings lies on the timing correlation plateau. The other baud beginning lies within the noise floor. The final choice for the per-subcarrier rotation phase becomes:
The performance of the present synchronization method in tracking mode is similar to that in acquisition mode, except that the number of computations is reduced. Timing correlations that search for a baud with N identical segments need only be performed over a small region near the current decimation phase and only while a sync baud is received.
