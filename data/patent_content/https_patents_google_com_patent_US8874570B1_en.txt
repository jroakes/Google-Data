Definitions
- the present invention relates to providing search results from search engines, such as Internet and Intranet search engines, and in particular to promoting the rankings of selected search results.
- Search engines provide a powerful tool for locating documents in a large database of documents, such as the documents on the Internet or World Wide Web (WWW), or the documents stored on the computers of an Intranet.
- the documents are located in response to a search query submitted by a user.
- a search query may consist of one or more words, terms, keywords, phrases and/or combinations thereof.
- search engines Returning search results that closely match, or ideally, that do match a user's interests is a desired characteristic of search engines. This is especially the case in the current environment where there are ever increasing amounts of information. In the absence of such capability, information overload is a real concern: search engines would return too many results to be useful. As a consequence, existing search engines employ a variety of techniques to improve the relevance of search results. Nonetheless, it is still difficult to tailor search results based on a user's profile. There is a need, therefore, for an improved technique for personalizing search engine results.

- One or more search results in a set of search engine results may be personalized by boosting a ranking of one or more of the search results for a user performing a search on the Internet, on one or more Intranets, or on combinations of the Internet and one or more Intranets.
- the search results may further include local results for information stored on the user's own computer or local network, which may be display along with other search results.
- Boosting of search results may use one or more search boost vectors.
- the search boost vectors may cause certain search results to be promoted to a higher position in the search result list if associated content is deemed relevant to the user.
- a search boost vector is, at least in part, generated based on a seed or first set of content location identifiers that may be expanded based on co-occurrence information (i.e., information related to two content location identifiers being visited by one or more users during one or more time intervals).
- the co-occurrence information may be associated with a user's session data or session data from a community of users.
- One or more content location identifiers may include one or more uniform resource locators (URLs), as well as addresses or identifiers for one or more documents, one or more content pages (such as web-pages on the WWW) and one or more content sites (such as web-sites on the WWW).
- URLs uniform resource locators
- the terms “URL” or “URLs” broadly signify one or more of these alternatives.
- the term “URL” may signify a domain name in a URL and the term “URLs” may signify domain names in URLs.
- the co-occurrence information may include one or more additional URLs for additional content that is co-visited, by the user and/or community of users, with the one or more URLs in the first set.
- the use of co-occurrence information can provide a set of additional URLs that may be related to a first set of URLs. For example, if user A expresses a preference for URL A and its associated contents and co-occurrence information indicates that many users who visited URL A also visited URL B, then there is a likelihood that user A would also be interested in URL B and its associated contents.
- co-occurrence information is subject to certain filtering criteria.
- FIG. 1 is a flow chart illustrating an embodiment of a method 100 for generating one or more search boost vectors.
- a seed or first set of URLs for first content is provided 112 .
- the first set of URLs can be determined or generated in a number of ways.
- the first set of URLs may be specified by the user by indicating his or her preferences, such as categories of interest, in one or more user profiles.
- the user profile may contain the first set of URLs, or the user profile may contain other information (e.g., keywords, identifiers of categories of information that are of interest to the user) that is then mapped to the first set of URLs, or a combination of these techniques may be used.
- the first set of URLs at 112 may be the URL of a web-page or web-site from which users may submit search queries to a search engine.
- the first set of URLs at 112 may be the URLs that the user has visited (which may be listed in the user profile or in a log).
- the URLs that the user has visited may allow an associated category to be determined either using the one or more content site profiles or by using a classifier on the content of the URLs.
- Content site profiles may include category information for associated URLs.
- the first set of URLs may also be pre-identified for a particular category (e.g., one or more URLs identified as associated with “sports” content are pre-identified with a “sports” category).
- multiple sets of URLs may be combined to create the first set of URLs.
- the sets are combined in a weighted fashion based on a category's relative importance to the user.
- the first set of URLs may be drawn from a set of URLs previously visited by the user (e.g., by examining a URL or history log associated with the user).
- the first set of URLs is composed of those URLs visited by the user during an interval of time or a time window.
- the first set of URLs is composed of those URLs frequently visited by the user such as those visited at least a threshold number of times during the interval of time (e.g., at least 4 times during a 7-day period).
- the first set of URLs is composed of those URLs identified or marked by the user as belonging to the set of a user's “favorites.”
- a user's interests may also be determined or identified from meta-information associated with URLs visited by the user. For example, the user may visit a URL that has an associated content site profile (e.g., topics or categories) describing the type of content found at the URL (e.g., the web site “espn.com” may have a “sports” profile associated with it).
- the URL may have more than one category associated with it, and/or may have a weighted set of categories associated with it. Each of these categories may correspond to a set of predefined URLs that may provide the first set of URLs.
- the first set may be created from a combination of any of the previously mentioned techniques.
- the first set of URLs for first content has been identified 112 it is used to identify a second set of URLs for second content 118 .
- one or more predefined and stored sets of URLs may be accessed based on one or more of the URLs in the first set of URLs.
- the second set of URLs is related to the first set in accordance with one or more predefined criteria.
- the predefined criteria is based on a co-visitation by the user to a URL in the first set of URLs and a URL in the second set of URLs satisfying one or more predefined criteria.
- the co-visitation is based on the activities of the user.
- the co-visitation is based on the activities of a community of users. In still further embodiments, the co-visitation is based on a combination of actions of the user and the community of users. In some embodiments, co-visitation by the community of users may be during a particular time interval.
- the second set of URLs may correspond to at least a portion of the first set of URLs.
- the search boost vector is generated by determining weights or relevance scores corresponding to URLs in the first set of URLs and/or the second set of URLs 120 .
- the method 100 illustrated in FIG. 1 may omit one or more operations, may reorder one or more operations or may include one or more additional operations.
- determining co-visitation with other URLs may be accomplished in a number of ways.
- a group of users U in the community of users that visit at least one of the URLs in the first set of URLs may be determined based on log data for their sessions.
- Log data may include URL log data (e.g., URL and timestamp information) and/or cookie information associated with a particular URL.
- cookies are typically implemented as files stored on the users' computers that indicate the users' identity or other information used by many content locations such as web-pages and web-sites.
- the terms “cookie” and “cookie file” may be used interchangeably. Cookies may include information such as login or registration identification, user preferences, or any other information that a host at a content location sends to a user's search assistant or browser for the search assistant to return to the host at a later time.
- a set S of additional URLs that are visited by this user within the time interval before and after the visit to URL W i.e., co-visited.
- the time interval may be 30 minutes, 60 minutes or other suitable time periods including time periods less than an average maximum duration of the users' U sessions and a maximum duration of the sessions for one or more users in the group U.
- One or more of the co-visited URLs S may be added to a set P of potential related URLs.
- the set P corresponds to the second set of URLs.
- Each of the URLs in the set P has a corresponding weight.
- the corresponding weight is indicative of a co-visitation strength between URLs S and the URL W.
- the corresponding weight may vary based on a time difference between the visit to at least one of the URLs in the first set of URLs, such as URL W, and one of the co-visited URLs S.
- a URL S might have a corresponding weight that decreases in value as the time interval between the co-visitation of URLs S and URL W increases. This may be accomplished by applying an optional time-based windowing function 116 ( FIG. 1 ).
- the time-based windowing function applied 116 may be a symmetric or asymmetric weighting function as a function of time.
- a visit to a URL B after a visit to a URL A may indicate a stronger relationship between content at URL B to content at URL A than if URL B had been visited before URL A.
- the weight may be inversely proportional to a number of URLs visited between the visit to URL W and the co-visit to one of the additional URLs S. If a duplicate URL occurs when adding one or more of the co-visited URLs S to the set P, i.e., the URL already is in the set P, the weights corresponding to these URLs may be combined, for example, by addition.
- the weights corresponding to the URLs in the set P are a measure of a frequency of occurrence of co-visitations.
- the weight could correspond to a frequency that URL W was co-visited with one of the URLs S.
- one or more of the weights may be normalized.
- one or more weights may be multiplied by an inverse document frequency that reduces those weights corresponding to URLs that are visited by a larger number of users in the group U. Such a normalization may reduce the weights corresponding to popular URLs that are visited often irrespective of a relationship between their content and the content at one or more of the URLs in the first set of URLs.
- the weights could correspond to a probability that one of the URLs S was co-visited with URL W. In some embodiments, the weights could correspond to a conditional probability of co-visiting one of the URLs S given a visit with URL W. In some embodiments, the weights could correspond to a conditional probability of co-visiting URL W given a visit with one of URLs S. And, in some embodiments, the weights could correspond to a combination of one or more of the probabilities.
- weights may be determined for the first set of URLs, or the first set of URLs and the second set of URLs.
- URLs in the first set may be provided a corresponding weight related to the importance to the user (e.g., all URLs in the first set could have a corresponding weight set to 1.10 such that each URL, if found in a set of search results, would have its ranking value boosted by 10%).
- the windowing function may be applied 116 to one of more of the weights corresponding to one or more of the first set of URLs.
- FIGS. 9A and 9B illustrate embodiments 900 and 920 of windowing functions for modifying weights in the search boost vector corresponding to one or more URLs.
- FIG. 9A shows weight 910 as a function of time difference 912 between a visit to one of the URLs in the first set of URLs, such as URL W, and one of the co-visited additional URLs S. Origin 914 corresponds to the visit to URL W.
- the windowing function shape 916 is symmetric about the origin 914 . In embodiment 920 , however, the windowing function shape 922 is asymmetric about the origin 914 .
- Embodiments 900 and 920 illustrate windowing functions having a linear dependence of the weight 910 on the time difference 912 . In other embodiments, windowing functions may have a non-linear dependence of the weight 910 on the time difference 912 .
- FIG. 10 illustrates an embodiment of a search boost vector 1000 generated using the method 100 ( FIG. 1 ).
- the search boost vector 1000 has multiple entries 1010 .
- Each entry 1010 such as entry 1010 _ 1 , has a URL 1012 and a corresponding weight 1014 .
- the search boost vector may be truncated after a certain number of URLs 1016 (e.g. n URLs). Alternately, the search boost vector may be truncated by excluding the entries 1010 having weights lower than a threshold or by excluding the entries 1010 with rank values below a threshold rank value.
- the search boost vector 1000 may be used to personalize one or more search results.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart illustrating an embodiment of a method 200 for using one or more search boost vectors to boost one or more search results.
- the user input to the search assistant is monitored 214 and when appropriate, a search query is sent 216 to a search engine 212 .
- the search engine 212 receives the search query 218 and generates search results 220 .
- one or more search results Prior to transmission to the client 210 , one or more search results are boosted using one or more search boost vectors 222 .
- the boosting modifies an order in of the search results.
- the boosted/reordered search results are received 224 and/or presented to the user, i.e., the rankings of one or more search results are changed.
- the method 200 illustrated in FIG. 2 may omit one or more operations, may reorder one or more operations or may include one or more additional operations.
- the search boost vectors may be identified or determined based on one or more user profiles or preferences and/or one or more content site profiles.
- Boosting search results using one or more search boost vectors that are identified or determined based on one or more user profiles or preferences is often referred to as personalized search.
- Boosting search results using one or more search boost vectors that are identified or determined based on one or more content site profiles is often referred to as content site flavored search.
- personalized search results are search results produced by personalized search and/or content site flavored search.
- each search result has an information retrieval value, sometimes called a query score.
- the one or more search results are boosted by multiplying one or more of the information retrieval values by one or more weights 1014 ( FIG. 10 ) in the search boost vector, such as search boost vector 1000 ( FIG. 10 ).
- the search boost vector may be determined using the method 100 illustrated in FIG. 1 .
- the first set of URLs may be provided and the second set of URLs may be identified 118 and/or determined 116 (see below) in accordance with the one or more predefined criteria.
- the one or more predefined criteria may include co-visiting of one or more additional URLs and one or more of the URLs in the first set of URLs.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an embodiment of a method 300 using one or more search boost vectors in a search engine, such as the search engine 212 ( FIG. 2 ).
- a search query is received 310 . If search results for the search query are found in a search results cache 312 , the one or more search results are boosted 318 using one or more search boost vectors. If the search results for a query are not in the cache 312 , search results for the search query are obtained 314 , cached 316 and boosted 318 .
- the boosting 318 uses one or more search boost vectors.
- the search results are returned 320 and the procedure ends 322 .
- caching 316 of the search results is optional, and a decision to cache or not cache the search results may be based on a score or other assessment indicating a likelihood of the same search query being processed again.
- URLs added to the second set include URLs that users in the community of users co-visited with one or more of the URLs in the first set during one or more time intervals and, optionally, subject to certain filtering criteria. Determining 116 ( FIG. 1 ) and/or identifying 118 ( FIG. 1 ) the URLs for inclusion in the second set of URLs using such co-visits from the community of users over the time interval is useful in obtaining robust weights in one or more of the search boost vectors in that the co-visitation patterns can be analyzed over a larger sample set. In particular, the aggregate determination over time and for the community of users is useful in reducing the impact of noise, which is often associated with sparse or limited data.
- Noise may include co-visited URLs that do not reflect a topical relationship, i.e., the content at one or more of the URLs may not be of interest to the user.
- a jump from one URL to another URL may represent a random jump from URL to URL and, by itself, implies no connection between the corresponding content.
- the use of the community of users allows additional URLs, and thus additional content, that were never visited by the user to be included in the second set of URLs. Such additional URLs may be of interest to the user.
- the community of users may be defined as a group of users sharing common set of characteristics (e.g., the group of users who share a common computer or live within the same household, a group of co-workers, users of a particular search engine and/or users of the Internet).
- co-visits to one or more of the additional URLs that are indicative of a topical relationship with content at one or more of the URLs in the first set of URLs, and that may be potentially of interest for inclusion in the second set of URLs are determined using one or more uniqueness factors and/or one or more consistency factors 114 ( FIG. 1 ).
- the various factors may have the effect of filtering out those co-visits that are less likely to reveal a topical connection and/or that are so few in number as to be spurious or reveal individual user activities.
- a uniqueness factor may include a conditional probability that an additional URL B is co-visited if a URL A in the first set of URLs is visited. Note that the reverse may not always be true.
- the co-visits may be by the community of users during the time interval.
- the time interval is used to assist in making the determination of the likelihood of a related co-visit (e.g., a visit to URL B days after URL A is visited is certainly less likely to be related than a visit to URL C within minutes of a visit to URL A).
- time intervals that can be used.
- another time interval is the period over which the query log is examined to determine co-visits (e.g., over the last day, week, month or year).
- the uniqueness factor must be equal to or greater than a threshold (e.g., 0.90) in order for the potential relationship between content at two or more URLs to be considered.
- a consistency factor may include an absolute number of visits that are made to URL A, URL B and/or co-visits to URL A and URL B.
- the consistency factor must be greater than a threshold in order for the URL to be considered to provide enough visitations for use in determining a relationship between content at the URLs (e.g., 10,000 within a day).
- a co-visitation is not considered to provide information suggesting a relationship between content at the two URLs unless both the uniqueness factor threshold and the consistency factor threshold are met or exceeded.
- FIG. 8 illustrates an embodiment of a URL visit and co-visit data structure 880 that may be used when determining one or more uniqueness and/or one or more consistency factors.
- the data structure 880 has multiple entries 890 .
- Each entry 890 such as first entry 890 _ 1 , has first and second URLs 892 and 893 , which are a URLs from the historical log (e.g., URL B — 1 and URL A — 1), co-visit frequency 894 (during the time interval over which the log is being examined) of the two URLs (e.g., the number of times URLs 892 and 893 were visited within a predefined time window) and visit frequency 894 for the second URL 893 during the time interval over which the log is being examined.
- the first URL 892 in each entry 890 may be a URL from the first set discussed above, while the second URL 893 in the same entry may be a candidate for inclusion in the second set because it was co-visited with the first URL at least once.
- the co-visit frequency 894 is related to the conditional probability that the URLs 892 and 893 are co-visited given that the URL 892 is visited, plus the conditional probability that URL 893 is co-visited given that the URL 892 is visited.
- the co-visit frequency 894 is related to the probability that the URL 892 and 893 are visited plus the conditional probability that URL 892 is co-visited given that the URL 893 is visited and the conditional probability that the URL 892 is co-visited given that URL 893 is visited. In some embodiments, the co-visit frequency 894 is related to the probability that the URLs 892 and 893 are visited without taking into consideration conditional probabilities.
- the “1” entry in the column 894 for first entry 890 _ 1 illustrates that URL A and URL B — 1 were co-visited once.
- a uniqueness factor is determined by dividing the number of co-visits of URL A — 1 and URL B — 1 894 divided by the number of total visits to URL A — 1 896 (e.g., 1).
- a consistency factor is represented by the number of visits to the URL A — 1 896 during the time period (e.g., 1). As can be seen from the examining the uniqueness factor and consistency factor, URL B — 1 was co-visited with URL A — 1 only once and URL A — 1 was itself not visited many times.
- URL B — 2 was co-visited with URL C 5,000 times and URL C was visited 1,000,000 times.
- the nth entry 890 — n illustrates a co-visitation frequency of 9,000 and a visitation frequency of 10,000.
- URL D would likely be included in the second set of URLs.
- the corresponding weight in one or more search boost vectors would be one plus the uniqueness factor.
- Uniqueness factors may be determined for one or more URLs in the first set of URLs and/or the second set of URLs.
- one or more uniqueness factors are normalized by one or more inverse document frequencies, such as the inverse of the visit frequency to URL 896 .
- only uniqueness factors are determined. If a particular uniqueness factor exceeds a threshold, such as 50% (i.e., 0.50) using the above techniques, then consistency between two or more URLs is likely and the corresponding additional URL is included in the second set of URLs. In other embodiments, one or more uniqueness factors are only determined if an absolute number of visits to one or more URLs exceeds a threshold (e.g., 10,000).
- one or more uniqueness factors may include an inverse conditional probability, e.g., the number of co-visits to URL A divided by the total number of visits to URL B.
- inverse conditional probability e.g., the number of co-visits to URL A divided by the total number of visits to URL B.
- the first content at one of the URLs in the first set of URLs may be basketball.
- the additional content at one of the additional URLs may be sports shoes, such as sneakers. Determining the uniqueness factor by dividing total number of co-visits to the additional content by visits to the first content is more interesting than determining the uniqueness factor by dividing co-visits to the first content by visits to the additional content since basketball may be relevant to sports shoes but sport shoes need not be relevant to basketball.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a search engine system 400 that generates search results in response to search queries from one or more clients 410 .
- Each client 410 may have a search assistant, such as search assistant 412 .
- search assistant 412 the layout of the search engine system 400 is merely exemplary and may take on any other suitable layouts or configurations.
- the search engine system 400 is used to search an index of documents, such as billions of web-pages or other documents indexed by modern search engines.
- search engine system 400 can be used as an Internet search engine, for locating documents on the WWW, or as an Intranet search engine, for locating documents stored on servers or other hosts within an Intranet.
- the methodology described herein is applicable to implementations where only portions of documents, such as titles and abstracts, are stored in the database of the search engine system 400 .
- the search engine system 400 may include multiple data centers each housing a backend.
- the data centers are generally widely dispersed from one another, such as across the continental United States. Search queries submitted by users at one of the clients 410 to the search engine system 400 are routed to an appropriate backend as part of the Domain Name System (DNS), based on current load, geographic locality and/or whether that datacenter is operating.
- DNS Domain Name System
- Each backend preferably includes multiple query servers, such as query server 416 , coupled to a communications network 414 .
- the communications network 414 may be the Internet, but may also be any local area network (LAN) and/or wide area network (WAN).
- each query server 416 is a server that receives search query requests and delivers search results in the form of web pages via HTTP, XML or similar protocols.
- the query server 416 is used within a LAN, i.e., internally and not by the public, it may be an Intranet server.
- the query servers, such as query server 416 are configured to control the search process, including searching a document index, analyzing and formatting the search results, and also including boosting one or more of the search results.
- Each backend also preferably includes multiple query processing controllers, such as query processing controller 430 , coupled to the multiple query servers, such as the query server 416 .
- Each of the query processing controllers may be coupled to a cache 438 , a URL database 432 , an inverse document index 434 and a document database 436 .
- Each query processing controller is configured to receive requests from one of the query servers, such as the query server 416 , and transmit the requests to the cache 438 , the URL database 432 , the inverse document index 434 and the document database 436 .
- the cache 438 is used to increase search efficiency by temporarily storing previously located search results.
- the efficiency and cost of performing a search is dependent on a number of factors, such as the various combinations of terms and/or keywords used in the search query, the length of time spent on the search and the number of documents indexed.
- the average response time and cost of a search is lowered by storing the search results 442 of previously requested search queries in the temporary storage or cache 438 of the search engine system 400 .
- One of the benefits of keeping a cache of commonly searched information is that it ensures a fast response to subsequent search queries for the same information, as it takes less time to retrieve the information from local memory.
- Another benefit of caching commonly searched information is to reduce the cost of servicing multiple search queries requesting the same information.
- an index 440 contains a pointer to a cache entry corresponding to a current search query 444 .
- the search rank values for the documents in the search results are conveyed to the query processing controller 430 and/or the query server 416 , and are used to construct an ordered search result list.
- the query processing controller 430 constructs the ordered search result list
- the query processing controller 430 transmits to the document database 436 a request for snippets of an appropriate subset of the documents in the ordered search list. For example, the query processing controller 430 may request snippets for the first fifteen or so of the documents in the ordered search result list.
- the document database 436 constructs snippets based on the search query, and returns the snippets to the query processing controller 430 .
- the query processing controller 430 then returns a list of located documents and snippets back to the query server 416 .
- the snippets are stored in the cache server 438 along with the cached results 442 .
- the query processing controller 430 only requests snippets for documents, if any, for which it is unable to obtain valid cached snippets from the cache server 438 .
- the query server 416 has a client communication module 418 for communicating, using the communication network 414 , with one or more of the clients 410 .

- the query receipt, processing and response module 420 may boost one or more of the search results, i.e., the ranking in the list of located documents and snippets.
- the query server 416 then transmits the search results or a portion of the search results to the user requesting the search.
- the boosting of search results is performed before snippet generation or retrieval from cache, because snippets are initially generated only for the top N (e.g., 10 to 25) search results, until a user requests a listing of lower ranked search results.
- N e.g. 10 to 25
- snippets are generated or retrieved only (or primarily) for search results conveyed to and/or presented to the requestor, thereby conserving the system resources used to generate snippets.
- FIG. 5 is an embodiment of a data structure 500 corresponding to the user URL log 426 ( FIG. 4 ).
- the data structure 500 has multiple entries 510 .
- Each of the entries 510 such as entry 510 _ 1 , has a user or source identification 512 , a time stamp 514 and a URL 516 .
- the URL 516 represents a URL visit or download by the identified user.
- the data structure may be used in conjunction with the method 100 illustrated in FIG. 1 to determine one or more search boost vectors 428 ( FIG. 4 ).
- the source identification 512 may be provided by a unique cookie associated with a particular search session, toolbar instance or user and may provide additional information.

- the user information database 628 may also have one or more content site profiles.
- the query log 422 may include one or more queries 632 .
- the memory 622 may also include a boost vector module 638 and the user URL log 426 .
- the boost vector module 638 may include windowing functions 640 , such as windowing function 900 in FIG. 9A , co-visited URL module 642 , URL set expansion module 648 and URL set weighting module 650 .
- the co-visited URL module 642 may include URL co-visit frequency 644 and inverse document frequency 646 values, such as those illustrated in data structure 880 ( FIG. 8 ).
- the URL set expansion module 648 and the URL set weighting module 650 may be used in the method 100 illustrated in FIG. 1 to generate one or more search boost vectors.
- FIG. 6 shows search engine 600 as a number of discrete items
- FIG. 6 is intended more as a functional description of the various features which may be present in a search engine system rather than as a structural schematic of the embodiments described herein.
- the functions of the search engine 600 may be distributed over a large number of servers or computers, with various groups of the servers performing particular subsets of those functions. Items shown separately in FIG. 6 could be combined and some items could be separated. For example, some items shown separately in FIG. 6 could be implemented on single servers and single items could be implemented by one or more servers (e.g., the query log 422 in FIG. 4 could be distributed among a plurality of servers).
- the actual number of servers in a search engine system and how features are allocated among them will vary from one implementation to another, and may depend in part on the amount of information stored by the system and/or the amount data traffic that the system must handle during peak usage periods as well as during average usage periods.
