Definitions
- the present disclosure is generally directed to systems, devices, and methods relating to optical engines, for example, optical engines for laser projectors used in wearable heads-up displays or other applications.
- a projector is an optical device that projects or shines a pattern of light onto another object (e.g., onto a surface of another object, such as onto a projection screen) in order to display an image or video on that other object.
- a projector necessarily includes a light source, and a laser projector is a projector for which the light source comprises at least one laser.
- the at least one laser is temporally modulated to provide a pattern of laser light and usually at least one controllable mirror is used to spatially distribute the modulated pattern of laser light over a two-dimensional area of another object. The spatial distribution of the modulated pattern of laser light produces an image at or on the other object.
- At least one controllable mirror may be used to control the spatial distribution, and may include: a single digital micromirror (e.g., a microelectromechanical system (“MEMS”) based digital micromirror) that is controllably rotatable or deformable in two dimensions, or two digital micromirrors that are each controllably rotatable or deformable about a respective dimension, or a digital light processing (“DLP”) chip comprising an array of digital micromirrors.
- MEMS microelectromechanical system
- DLP digital light processing
- each respective laser diode may have a corresponding respective focusing lens.
- Each of the laser diodes of a laser module are typically housed in a separate package (e.g., a TO-38 package or “can”).
- the relative positions of the laser diodes, the focusing lenses, and the at least one controllable mirror are all tuned and aligned so that each laser beam impinges on the at least one controllable mirror with substantially the same spot size and with substantially the same rate of convergence (so that all laser beams will continue to have substantially the same spot size as they propagate away from the laser projector towards, e.g., a projection screen).
- a conventional laser projector it is usually possible to come up with such a configuration for all these elements because the overall form factor of the device is not a primary design consideration.
- the form factor of the laser projector is an important design element, it can be very challenging to find a configuration for the laser diodes, the focusing lenses, and the at least one controllable mirror that sufficiently aligns the laser beams (at least in terms of spot size, spot position, and rate of convergence) while satisfying the form factor constraints.
- a head-mounted display is an electronic device that is worn on a user's head and, when so worn, secures at least one electronic display within a viewable field of at least one of the user's eyes, regardless of the position or orientation of the user's head.
- a wearable heads-up display is a head-mounted display that enables the user to see displayed content but also does not prevent the user from being able to see their external environment.
- the “display” component of a wearable heads-up display is either transparent or at a periphery of the user's field of view so that it does not completely block the user from being able to see their external environment.
- a “combiner” component of a wearable heads-up display is the physical structure where display light and environmental light merge as one within the user's field of view. The combiner of a wearable heads-up display is typically transparent to environmental light but includes some optical routing mechanism to direct display light into the user's field of view.
- wearable heads-up displays include: the Google Glass®, the Optinvent Ora®, the Epson Moverio®, and the Sony Glasstron®, just to name a few.
- a wearable heads-up display The optical performance of a wearable heads-up display is an important factor in its design. When it comes to face-worn devices, users also care a lot about aesthetics and comfort. This is clearly highlighted by the immensity of the eyeglass (including sunglass) frame industry. Independent of their performance limitations, many of the aforementioned examples of wearable heads-up displays have struggled to find traction in consumer markets because, at least in part, they lack fashion appeal or comfort. Most wearable heads-up displays presented to date employ relatively large components and, as a result, are considerably bulkier, less comfortable and less stylish than conventional eyeglass frames.
- Femtosecond laser micro-machining is a direct-laser-write and rapid prototyping technique that provides great potential for optical device fabrication. Strong focusing of femtosecond laser light into transparent glass can induce positive refractive index modifications up to 0.01 refractive index units (RIU) within the material and without surface damage. Since then, ultrafast (femto/pico-second) lasers have been shown to enable flexible 3D structuring of various glasses, and has led to the demonstration of many types of optical devices (waveguides, couplers, Bragg gratings, waveplates, etc.) that serve as building blocks for 3D optical circuits.
- optical devices waveguides, couplers, Bragg gratings, waveplates, etc.
- Direct-laser-writing uses ultrashort laser pulses to confine strong nonlinear optical interactions that may induce, for example, positive or negative refractive index changes in bulk transparent materials for creating optical waveguides (WGs).
- the mechanisms by which direct-laser-write modifications occur include, but are not limited to, multiphoton ionization, avalanche ionization, electron-atom collisions, plasma interactions, thermal effects (e.g. diffusion, heat accumulation), energy dissipation, and material cooling leading to inhomogeneous solidification.
- waveguide performance can be tuned and optimized by, but not limited to, the writing laser's properties (pulse duration, pulse temporal shape, bandwidth and shape, pulse repetition rate, wavelength, polarization, and beam spatial shape) and the focusing conditions (lens numerical aperture, air/liquid immersion, translation direction and speeds).

- FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram of a laser writing system 800 in accordance with the present systems, designs and methods.
- Laser writing system 800 comprises at least writing laser 810 , focusing optic 812 , writeable glass 820 and translatable mount 830 .
- Glass is used herein for convenience, any appropriate laser-writable material could be used in place of writeable glass 820 .
- Writing laser 810 emits laser light 811 .
- Laser light 811 comprises short (femtosecond and/or picosecond length) pulses of laser light; consequently, laser light 811 has extremely high peak instantaneous power.
- Focusing optic 812 focuses laser light 811 to focal point 813 .
- Writeable glass 820 may comprise a contiguous piece of glass or similar transparent material, which is typically transparent to the laser light 811 emitted by the writing laser 810 ; in other words the light emitted by the writing laser generally will not be absorbed by the glass via typical (linear) optical processes.
- the intensity of laser light 811 is very high due to the combination of spatial focusing (focusing the beam of writing laser light 811 to a small point 813 ) and temporal focusing (emitting the laser light 811 as extremely short femptosecond or picosecond pulses).
- the high intensity of light at the focal point 813 allows nonlinear optical processes such as multiphoton absorption, avalanche ionization, Coulomb collisions (causing lattice ionization and breakdown), and heat conduction to occur in the writeable glass 820 , absorbing the light and changing the refractive index of the glass.
- the change in refractive index may be a positive increase in refractive index.
- Writeable glass 820 can be physically coupled to translatable mount 830 , such as by using clamps 821 , adhesive, or any other appropriate coupling mechanism. Such coupling mechanism is preferably removable, such that writeable glass 820 can be detached from translatable mount 830 after laser writing is complete. Translation of translatable mount 830 in the X, Y, and/or Z direction will result in corresponding translation of writeable glass 820 , moving the location of focal point 813 within writeable glass 820 . Translating the writeable glass 820 relative to focal point 813 can create a region of changed refractive index in the writeable glass 820 . An increased refractive index in this region causes any light channeled therethrough to experience total internal reflection, thus forming waveguide 822 . In other words, waveguide 822 can be formed as a continuous path of increased refractive index within writeable glass 820 created by laser light 811 at focal point 813 .
- FIG. 8 can be used to laser write at least one waveguide into writeable glass 820 .
- a photonic integrated circuit could be written, such as photonic integrated circuit 600 described with regards to FIG. 6 .
- Writing at least one waveguide may include writing an individual waveguide for each wavelength of light impinging on the writeable glass 820 , where each waveguide comprises a respective input facet and a respective output facet. Each output facet may be positioned to provide light to other components or modules, such as a scan mirror of a laser projector, etc.
- four waveguides could be written into writeable glass 820 , one waveguide for each beam of light 610 a , 610 b , 610 c , and 610 d.
- Writing at least one waveguide may include writing a waveguide combiner, wherein the waveguide combiner combines individual laser beams into a coaxially superimposed aggregate beam.
- Writing a waveguide combiner may include writing at least one: directional coupler (DC), Y-branch, whispering gallery mode coupler, or multi-mode interference coupler.
- the aggregate beam may be provided to other components or modules, such as a scan mirror of a laser projector, etc.
- the photonic integrated circuit 600 may include one or more diffractive optical elements (DOE) and/or refractive/reflective optical elements that combine the different color beams 610 a - d in order to achieve coaxial superposition.
- DOE diffractive optical elements
- refractive/reflective optical elements that combine the different color beams 610 a - d in order to achieve coaxial superposition.
- individual waveguides could be writed or written which do not strictly coaxially superimpose the beams of light, but instead bring each beam of light close together. That is, the input facet for each waveguide in the photonic integrated circuit can be positioned relatively far from the other input facets, to receive laser light from a respective laser diode, but the output facets for each of the waveguides can be positioned relatively close together. In other words, a spacing between the output facets of each waveguide can be smaller than a spacing of the input facets of each waveguide.
- each waveguide can be optimized for performance with light of a corresponding wavelength, for example to ensure that each wavelength of light exits the photonic integrated circuit with the same divergence angle as each other wavelength.
- the output of each individual waveguide can be placed close enough together (on the order of 10s of microns) such that that the light output by each individual waveguide may still follow the same optical path through the rest of a projector, display, or WHUD assembly where the photonic integrated circuit is implemented.
- FIG. 9 is a flow diagram of a method 900 of manufacturing an optical engine, in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods.
- the method 900 may be implemented to manufacture the optical engine 700 of FIG. 7 , for example. It should be appreciated that methods of manufacturing optical engines according to the present disclosure may include fewer or additional acts than set forth in the method 900 . Further, the acts discussed below may be performed in an order different than the order presented herein.

- the photonic integrated circuit may be butted directly against the cap and/or laser diodes, such that the photonic integrated circuit acts as the optical window, and laser light from the laser diodes may directly enter the input edge of the photonic integrated circuit.
- the input edge of the photonic integrated circuit may be positioned inside an interior volume of the cap, and the output edge of the photonic integrated circuit may be positioned outside the interior volume of the cap.
- each laser diode In order for light to travel through a photonic integrated circuit, the light emitted by each laser diode should preferably be aligned with a respective input facet on the input edge of the photonic integrated circuit with high precision; mis-alignment of greater than 10 micrometers may significantly reduce the efficiency of the photonic integrated circuit.
- An output facet of each laser diode may have dimensions smaller than four square micrometers; aligning such small components to such high precision presents a non-trivial technical challenge.
- the photonic integrated circuit instead of butting the input edge of the photonic integrated circuit against the optical window of the cap, the photonic integrated circuit can be bonded to the base substrate a distance away from the optical window, and coupling lenses such as coupling lenses 736 in FIG. 7 may be bonded to the base substrate between the optical window and the photonic integrated circuit.
- the coupling lenses can be aligned to couple light from each laser diode into a respective input facet at the input edge of the photonic integrated circuit.

Unless context below dictates otherwise, the disclosure of components in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8 is applicable to similarly numbered components in FIG. 10 and will not be repeated in the interests of brevity.
- Photonic integrated circuit writing system 1000 includes laser writing system 800 , which, during operation, writes a photonic integrated circuit in a block of writeable glass 820 in a manner similar to the operation of laser writing system 800 described above with reference to FIG. 8 .
- Photonic integrated circuit writing system 1000 can be utilized to manufacture an optical engine using a process that is similar in at least some respects to method 900 of FIG. 9 , but with photonic integrated circuit writing system 1000 , act 914 can be performed before act 912 , as detailed below.
- Writeable glass 820 is bonded to base substrate 702 prior to writing a photonic integrated circuit therein, using any of the bonding techniques discussed above.
- the writeable glass 820 may comprise a contiguous piece of glass or similar transparent material that undergoes a change in refractive index when exposed to high-intensity laser light. Bonding the writeable glass to the base substrate includes positioning and orienting the writeable glass 820 relative to each laser diode 710 to place the writeable glass 820 in the path of the beam of light emitted by each laser diode 710 , such that the beam of light emitted by each laser diode 710 impinges on an input edge of the writeable glass.
- Writeable glass 820 can be butted up against optical window 730 , such that beams of light from laser diodes 710 passes through optical window 730 directly into writeable glass 820 .
- the writeable glass 820 may optionally form optical window 730 .
- writeable glass 820 may be bonded directly to at least one of the laser diodes 710 and/or at least one laser CoS 712 .
- the entire base substrate 702 and all components bonded thereto can be physically coupled to translatable mount 830 , such as with clamps 821 , adhesives, and/or any other appropriate coupling mechanism.
- Such coupling mechanism is preferably removable, such that base substrate 702 and all components bonded thereto can be detached from translatable mount 830 after laser writing of writeable glass 820 is complete.
- writeable glass 820 With writeable glass 820 bonded to base substrate 702 and base substrate 702 physically coupled to translatable mount 830 , at least one waveguide 822 can be laser written into writeable glass 820 by translating base substrate 702 and all components thereon using translatable mount 830 . Consequently, writeable glass 820 becomes a photonic integrated circuit.
- laser diodes 710 could be activated, thus causing beams of light therefrom to impinge on an input edge of writeable block 820 .
- Writing laser 810 can be aligned to directly write waveguides at the exact location where the beams of light from laser diodes 710 impinge on the writeable block 820 . In this way, the input of the resulting photonic integrated circuit will be accurately aligned with the laser diodes, ensuring efficient incoupling of the beams of light into the photonic integrated circuit.
- the writeable glass 820 could be illuminated, such as by being backlit if base substrate 702 is at least partially transparent.
- Writing laser 810 can then be aligned to directly write waveguides at locations where shadows of laser diodes 710 and/or CoS's 712 appear. In this way, the input of the resulting photonic integrated circuit will be accurately aligned with the laser diodes, ensuring efficient incoupling of the beams of light into the photonic integrated circuit.
- Aligning the input facets of the photonic integrated circuit to the beams of light during the writing stage will be more accurate than trying to mechanically align a pre-fabricated photonic integrated circuit, due to deviations that can arise in the bonding processes of not only the pre-fabricated photonic integrate circuit, but also the laser diodes.
- the laser diodes As one example, if each of four laser diodes is randomly misaligned, it would be difficult to align a prefabricated photonic integrated circuit to match the beam of light from each diode, since not only could the photonic integrated circuit be misaligned during the bonding processes, but also the spacing between each laser diode may not match the spacing between each waveguide in the photonic integrated circuit due to the random misalignment of each of the laser diodes.
- Direct laser writing the photonic integrated circuit after all of the components have been mechanically bonded obviates these issues, by allowing the position and spacing of each laser diode relative to the writeable glass to be accounted for after bonding is complete.
- a photonic integrated circuit could be manufactured using a combination of the techniques described with reference to FIGS. 8, 9, and 10 , as discussed below.
- a large portion of a photonic integrated circuit could be first written, except for a small portion of the photonic integrated circuit at the input edge of writeable glass. Subsequently, the photonic integrated circuit could be bonded to a base substrate such as in FIG. 10 , and the remaining small portion of the photonic integrated circuit at the input edge of the writeable glass could be written to couple the output of each laser diode to the portion of the photonic integrated circuit which is already written.

- the light beam 1202 may diverge with full width half maximum (FWHM) angles of up to 40 degrees in the fast axis direction 1206 and up to 10 degrees in the slow axis direction 1208 . This divergence results in a rapidly expanding elliptical cone.

Abstract
Description
- The present disclosure is generally directed to systems, devices, and methods relating to optical engines, for example, optical engines for laser projectors used in wearable heads-up displays or other applications.
- A projector is an optical device that projects or shines a pattern of light onto another object (e.g., onto a surface of another object, such as onto a projection screen) in order to display an image or video on that other object. A projector necessarily includes a light source, and a laser projector is a projector for which the light source comprises at least one laser. The at least one laser is temporally modulated to provide a pattern of laser light and usually at least one controllable mirror is used to spatially distribute the modulated pattern of laser light over a two-dimensional area of another object. The spatial distribution of the modulated pattern of laser light produces an image at or on the other object. In conventional scanning laser projectors, at least one controllable mirror may be used to control the spatial distribution, and may include: a single digital micromirror (e.g., a microelectromechanical system (“MEMS”) based digital micromirror) that is controllably rotatable or deformable in two dimensions, or two digital micromirrors that are each controllably rotatable or deformable about a respective dimension, or a digital light processing (“DLP”) chip comprising an array of digital micromirrors.
- In a conventional laser projector comprising an RGB (red/green/blue) laser module with a red laser diode, a green laser diode, and a blue laser diode, each respective laser diode may have a corresponding respective focusing lens. Each of the laser diodes of a laser module are typically housed in a separate package (e.g., a TO-38 package or “can”). The relative positions of the laser diodes, the focusing lenses, and the at least one controllable mirror are all tuned and aligned so that each laser beam impinges on the at least one controllable mirror with substantially the same spot size and with substantially the same rate of convergence (so that all laser beams will continue to have substantially the same spot size as they propagate away from the laser projector towards, e.g., a projection screen). In a conventional laser projector, it is usually possible to come up with such a configuration for all these elements because the overall form factor of the device is not a primary design consideration. However, in applications for which the form factor of the laser projector is an important design element, it can be very challenging to find a configuration for the laser diodes, the focusing lenses, and the at least one controllable mirror that sufficiently aligns the laser beams (at least in terms of spot size, spot position, and rate of convergence) while satisfying the form factor constraints.
- A head-mounted display is an electronic device that is worn on a user's head and, when so worn, secures at least one electronic display within a viewable field of at least one of the user's eyes, regardless of the position or orientation of the user's head. A wearable heads-up display is a head-mounted display that enables the user to see displayed content but also does not prevent the user from being able to see their external environment. The “display” component of a wearable heads-up display is either transparent or at a periphery of the user's field of view so that it does not completely block the user from being able to see their external environment. A “combiner” component of a wearable heads-up display is the physical structure where display light and environmental light merge as one within the user's field of view. The combiner of a wearable heads-up display is typically transparent to environmental light but includes some optical routing mechanism to direct display light into the user's field of view.
- Examples of wearable heads-up displays include: the Google Glass®, the Optinvent Ora®, the Epson Moverio®, and the Sony Glasstron®, just to name a few.
- The optical performance of a wearable heads-up display is an important factor in its design. When it comes to face-worn devices, users also care a lot about aesthetics and comfort. This is clearly highlighted by the immensity of the eyeglass (including sunglass) frame industry. Independent of their performance limitations, many of the aforementioned examples of wearable heads-up displays have struggled to find traction in consumer markets because, at least in part, they lack fashion appeal or comfort. Most wearable heads-up displays presented to date employ relatively large components and, as a result, are considerably bulkier, less comfortable and less stylish than conventional eyeglass frames.
- Femtosecond laser micro-machining is a direct-laser-write and rapid prototyping technique that provides great potential for optical device fabrication. Strong focusing of femtosecond laser light into transparent glass can induce positive refractive index modifications up to 0.01 refractive index units (RIU) within the material and without surface damage. Since then, ultrafast (femto/pico-second) lasers have been shown to enable flexible 3D structuring of various glasses, and has led to the demonstration of many types of optical devices (waveguides, couplers, Bragg gratings, waveplates, etc.) that serve as building blocks for 3D optical circuits.
- Direct-laser-writing uses ultrashort laser pulses to confine strong nonlinear optical interactions that may induce, for example, positive or negative refractive index changes in bulk transparent materials for creating optical waveguides (WGs). The mechanisms by which direct-laser-write modifications occur include, but are not limited to, multiphoton ionization, avalanche ionization, electron-atom collisions, plasma interactions, thermal effects (e.g. diffusion, heat accumulation), energy dissipation, and material cooling leading to inhomogeneous solidification. For direct-laser-writing waveguides, waveguide performance can be tuned and optimized by, but not limited to, the writing laser's properties (pulse duration, pulse temporal shape, bandwidth and shape, pulse repetition rate, wavelength, polarization, and beam spatial shape) and the focusing conditions (lens numerical aperture, air/liquid immersion, translation direction and speeds).

Each of the plurality ofchip submounts 108 includes alaser diode 110, also referred to as a laser chip or laser die, bonded thereto. In particular, aninfrared chip submount 108 a carries aninfrared laser diode 110 a, ared chip submount 108 b carries ared laser diode 110 b, agreen chip submount 108 c carries agreen laser diode 110 c, and ablue chip submount 108 d carries ablue laser diode 110 d. In operation, theinfrared laser diode 110 a provides infrared laser light, thered laser diode 110 b provides red laser light, thegreen laser diode 110 c provides green laser light, and theblue laser diode 110 d provides blue laser light. Each of thelaser diodes 110 may comprise one of an edge emitter laser or a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL), for example. Each of the four laser diode/chip submount pairs may be referred to collectively as a “laser chip on submount,” or alaser CoS 112. Thus, theoptical engine 100 includes aninfrared laser CoS 112 a, ared laser CoS 112 b, agreen laser CoS 112 c, and ablue laser CoS 112 d. In at least some implementations, one or more of thelaser diodes 110 may be bonded directly to thebase substrate 102 without use of asubmount 108. It should be appreciated that although some implementations discussed herein describe laser diodes as chips or dies on submounts, other dies or types of devices, e.g., p-side down devices, may be used as well. - The
optical engine 100 also includes a laserdiode driver circuit 114 bonded to thebottom surface 106 of thebase substrate 102. The laserdiode driver circuit 114 is operatively coupled to the plurality oflaser diodes 110 via suitableelectrical connections 116 to selectively drive current to the plurality of laser diodes. In at least some implementations, the laserdiode driver circuit 114 may be positioned relative to theCoSs 112 to minimize the distance between the laserdiode driver circuit 114 and theCoSs 112. Although not shown inFIGS. 1A and 1B , the laserdiode driver circuit 114 may be operatively coupleable to a controller (e.g., microcontroller, microprocessor, ASIC) which controls the operation of the laserdiode driver circuit 114 to selectively modulate laser light emitted by thelaser diodes 110. In at least some implementations, the laserdiode driver circuit 114 may be bonded to another portion of thebase substrate 102, such as thetop surface 104 of the base substrate. In at least some implementations, the laserdiode driver circuitry 114 may be remotely located and operatively coupled to thelaser diodes 110. In order to not require the use of impedance matched transmission lines, the size scale may be small compared to a wavelength (e.g., lumped element regime), where the electrical characteristics are described by (lumped) elements like resistance, inductance, and capacitance. - Proximate the
laser diodes 110 there is positioned anoptical director element 118. Like thechip submounts 108, theoptical director element 118 is bonded to thetop surface 104 of thebase substrate 102. In the illustrated example, theoptical director element 118 has a triangular prism shape that includes a plurality of planar faces. In particular theoptical director element 118 includes an angledfront face 118 a that extends along the width of theoptical engine 100, arear face 118 b, abottom face 118 c that is bonded to thetop surface 104 of thebase substrate 102, aleft face 118 d, and aright face 118 e opposite the left face. Theoptical director element 118 may comprise a mirror or a prism, for example. - The
optical engine 100 also includes acap 120 that includes avertical sidewall 122 having a lowerfirst end 124 and an uppersecond end 126 opposite the first end. Aflange 128 may be disposed around a perimeter of thesidewall 122 adjacent the lowerfirst end 124. Proximate the uppersecond end 126 of thesidewall 122 there is a horizontaloptical window 130 that forms the “top” of thecap 120. Thesidewall 122 and theoptical window 130 together define aninterior volume 132 sized and dimensioned to receive the plurality ofchip submounts 108, the plurality oflaser diodes 110, and theoptical director element 118. The lowerfirst end 124 and theflange 128 of thecap 120 are bonded to thebase substrate 102 to provide a hermetic seal or a partial hermetic seal between theinterior volume 132 of the cap and avolume 134 exterior to the cap. - As shown best in
FIG. 1A , theoptical director element 118 is positioned and oriented to direct (e.g., reflect) laser light received from each of the plurality oflaser diodes 108 upward (as shown) toward theoptical window 130 of thecap 120, wherein the laser light exits theinterior volume 132. - The
cap 120 may have a round shape, rectangular shape, or other shape. Thus, thevertical sidewall 122 may comprise a continuously curved sidewall, a plurality (e.g., four) of adjacent planar portions, etc. Theoptical window 130 may comprise an entire top of thecap 120, or may comprise only a portion thereof. In at least some implementations, theoptical window 130 may be located on thesidewall 122 rather than positioned as a top of thecap 120, and thelaser diodes 110 and/or theoptical director element 118 may be positioned and oriented to direct the laser light from the laser diodes toward the optical window on thesidewall 122. At least some implementations may not includeoptical director element 118 such that laser light from the laser diodes may be output towards the optical window on thesidewall 122 without the need for intervening optical elements. In at least some implementations, thecap 120 may include a plurality of optical windows instead of a single optical window. - The
optical engine 100 also includes four collimation/pointinglenses 136 a-136 d (collectively 136), one for each of the fourlaser diodes 110 a-110 d, respectively, that are bonded to atop surface 138 of theoptical window 130. Each of the plurality ofcollimation lenses 136 is positioned and oriented to receive light from a corresponding one of thelaser diodes 110 through theoptical window 130. In particular, thecollimation lens 136 a receives light from theinfrared laser diode 110 a via theoptical director element 118 and theoptical window 130, thecollimation lens 136 b receives light from thered laser diode 110 b via the optical director element and the optical window, thecollimation lens 136 c receives light from thegreen laser diode 110 c via the optical director element and the optical window, and thecollimation lens 136 d receives light from theblue laser diode 110 d via the optical director element and the optical window. - Each of the
collimation lenses 136 is operative to receive laser light from a respective one of thelaser diodes 110, and to generate a single color beam. In particular, thecollimation lens 136 a receives infrared laser light from theinfrared laser diode 110 a and produces aninfrared laser beam 138 a, thecollimation lens 136 b receives red laser light from thered laser diode 110 b and produces ared laser beam 138 b, thecollimation lens 136 c receives green laser light from thegreen laser diode 110 c and produces agreen laser beam 138 c, and thecollimation lens 136 d receives blue laser light from theblue laser diode 110 d and produces ablue laser beam 138 d. - The
optical engine 100 may also include, or may be positioned proximate to, abeam combiner 140 that is positioned and oriented to combine thelight beams 138 a-138 d received from each of thecollimation lenses 136 into a singleaggregate beam 142. As an example, thebeam combiner 140 may include one or more diffractive optical elements (DOE) and/or refractive/reflective optical elements that combine thedifferent color beams 138 a-138 d in order to achieve coaxial superposition. An example beam combiner is shown inFIG. 3 and discussed below. - In at least some implementations, the
laser CoSs 112, theoptical director element 118, and/or thecollimation lenses 136 may be positioned differently. As noted above, laserdiode driver circuit 114 may be mounted on thetop surface 104 or thebottom surface 106 of thebase substrate 102, depending on the RF design and other constraints (e.g., package size). In at least some implementations, theoptical engine 100 may not include theoptical director element 118, and the laser light may be directed from thelaser diodes 110 toward thecollimation lenses 136 without requiring an intermediate optical director element. Additionally, in at least some implementations, one or more of the laser diodes may be mounted directly on thebase substrate 102 without use of a submount. - For the sake of a controlled atmosphere inside the
interior volume 132, it may be desirable to have no organic compounds inside theinterior volume 132. In at least some implementations, the components of theoptical engine 100 may be bonded together using no adhesives. In other implementations, a low amount of adhesives may be used to bond at least one of the components, which may reduce cost while providing a relatively low risk of organic contamination for a determined lifetime (e.g., 2 or more years) of theoptical engine 100. The use of adhesives may result in a partial hermetic seal, but this partial hermetic seal may be acceptable in certain applications, as detailed below. - Generally, “hermetic” refers to a seal which is airtight, that is, a seal which excludes the passage of air, oxygen, and other gases. “Hermetic” within the present specification carries this meaning. Further, “partially hermetic” as used herein refers to a seal which limits, but does not necessarily completely prevent, the passage of gases such as air. “Partially hermetic” as used herein may alternatively be stated as “reduced hermiticity”. In the example above, adhesives may be used to bond components. Such adhesives may result in a seal being not completely hermetic, in that some amount of gasses may slowly leak through the adhesive. However, such a seal can still be considered “partially hermetic” or as having “reduced hermiticity”, because the seal reduces the flow of gasses therethrough.
- In one example application, even in an environment with only partial hermiticity, the life of
laser diodes 110 and transparency ofoptical window 130 may be maintained longer than the life of a battery of a device, such that partial hermiticity may be acceptable for the devices. In some cases, even protectinginterior volume 132 from particulate with a dust cover may be sufficient to maintainlaser diodes 110 and transparency ofoptical window 130 for the intended lifespan of the device. In some cases,laser diodes 110 and transparency ofoptical window 130 may last for the intended lifespan of the device even without a protective cover. Various bonding processes (e.g., attaching processes) for theoptical engine 100 are discussed below with reference toFIG. 5 . -
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of amethod 200 of operating an optical engine, in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods. Themethod 200 may be implemented using theoptical engine 100 ofFIGS. 1A-1B , for example. It should be appreciated that methods of operating optical engines according to the present disclosure may include fewer or additional acts than set forth in themethod 200. Further, the acts discussed below may be performed in an order different than the order presented herein. - At 202, at least one controller may cause a plurality of laser diodes of an optical engine to generate laser light. As discussed above, the plurality of laser diodes may be hermetically sealed or partially hermetically sealed in an encapsulated package. The laser diodes may produce light sequentially and/or simultaneously with each other. At 204, at least one optical director element may optionally receive the laser light from the laser diodes. The optical director element may comprise a mirror or a prism, for example. As discussed above, in at least some implementations the optical engine may be designed such that laser light exits the optical engine without use of an optical director element.
- At 206, the at least one optical director element, if included, may direct the received laser light toward an optical window of the encapsulated package. For example, the optical director element may reflect the received laser light toward the optical window of the encapsulated package. In implementations without at least one optical director element, the laser light generated by the plurality of laser diodes may be output directly toward the optical window of the encapsulated package.
- At 208, a plurality of collimation lenses may collimate the laser light from the laser diodes that exits the encapsulated package via the optical window to generate a plurality of differently colored laser light beams. The collimation lenses may be positioned inside or outside of the encapsulated package. As an example, the collimation lenses may be physically coupled to the optical window of the encapsulated package.
- At 210, a beam combiner may combine the plurality of laser light beams received from each of the collimation lenses into a single aggregate beam. The beam combiner may include one or more diffractive optical elements (DOE) that combine different color beams in order to achieve coaxial superposition, for example. The beam combiner may include one or more DOEs and/or one or more refractive/reflective optical elements. An example beam combiner is shown in
FIG. 3 and discussed below. -
FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of a wearable heads-up display (WHUD) 300 with anexemplary laser projector 302, and atransparent combiner 304 in a field of view of aneye 306 of a user of the WHUD, in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods. TheWHUD 300 includes a support structure (not shown), with the general shape and appearance of an eyeglasses frame, carrying aneyeglass lens 308 with thetransparent combiner 304, and thelaser projector 302. - The
laser projector 302 comprises a controller orprocessor 310, anoptical engine 312 comprising fourlaser diodes processor 310, abeam combiner 316, and ascan mirror 318. Theoptical engine 312 may be similar or identical to theoptical engine 100 discussed above with reference toFIGS. 1A and 1B . Generally, the term “processor” refers to hardware circuitry, and may include any of microprocessors, microcontrollers, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs), programmable gate arrays (PGAs), and/or programmable logic controllers (PLCs), or any other integrated or non-integrated circuit. - During operation of the
WHUD 300, theprocessor 310 modulates light output from the laser diodes 314, which includes a firstred laser diode 314 a (R), a secondgreen laser diode 314 b (G), a thirdblue laser diode 314 c (B), and a fourthinfrared laser diode 314 d (IR). Thefirst laser diode 314 a emits a first (e.g., red)light signal 320, thesecond laser diode 314 b emits a second (e.g., green)light signal 322, thethird laser diode 314 c emits a third (e.g., blue)light signal 324, and thefourth laser diode 314 d emits a fourth (e.g., infrared)light signal 326. All four oflight signals beam combiner 316.Beam combiner 316 could for example be based on any of the beam combiners described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62/438,725, U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 15/848,265 (U.S. Publication Number 2018/0180885), U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 15/848,388 (U.S. Publication Number 2018/0180886), U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62/450,218, U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 15/852,188 (U.S. Publication Number 2018/0210215), U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 15/852,282, (U.S. Publication Number 2018/0210213), and/or U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 15/852,205 (U.S. Publication Number 2018/0210216). - In the illustrated example, the
beam combiner 316 includesoptical elements first light signal 320 is emitted towards the firstoptical element 328 and reflected by the firstoptical element 328 of thebeam combiner 316 towards the secondoptical element 330 of thebeam combiner 316. The secondlight signal 322 is also directed towards the secondoptical element 330. The secondoptical element 330 is formed of a dichroic material that is transmissive of the red wavelength of thefirst light signal 320 and reflective of the green wavelength of the secondlight signal 322. Therefore, the secondoptical element 330 transmits thefirst light signal 320 and reflects the secondlight signal 322. The secondoptical element 330 combines thefirst light signal 320 and the secondlight signal 322 into a single aggregate beam (shown as separate beams for illustrative purposes) and routes the aggregate beam towards the thirdoptical element 332 of thebeam combiner 316. - The third
light signal 324 is also routed towards the thirdoptical element 332. The thirdoptical element 332 is formed of a dichroic material that is transmissive of the wavelengths of light (e.g., red and green) in the aggregate beam comprising thefirst light signal 320 and the secondlight signal 322 and reflective of the blue wavelength of the thirdlight signal 324. Accordingly, the thirdoptical element 332 transmits the aggregate beam comprising thefirst light signal 320 and the secondlight signal 322 and reflects the thirdlight signal 324. In this way, the thirdoptical element 332 adds the thirdlight signal 324 to the aggregate beam such that the aggregate beam comprises the light signals 320, 322, and 324 (shown as separate beams for illustrative purposes) and routes the aggregate beam towards the fourthoptical element 334 in thebeam combiner 316. - The fourth
light signal 326 is also routed towards the fourthoptical element 334. The fourthoptical element 334 is formed of a dichroic material that is transmissive of the visible wavelengths of light (e.g., red, green, and blue) in the aggregate beam comprising thefirst light signal 320, the secondlight signal 322, and the thirdlight signal 324 and reflective of the infrared wavelength of the fourthlight signal 326. Accordingly, the fourthoptical element 334 transmits the aggregate beam comprising thefirst light signal 320, the secondlight signal 322, and the thirdlight signal 324 and reflects the fourthlight signal 326. In this way, the fourthoptical element 334 adds the fourthlight signal 326 to the aggregate beam such that theaggregate beam 336 comprises portions of the light signals 320, 322, 324, and 326. The fourthoptical element 334 routes theaggregate beam 336 towards thecontrollable scan mirror 318. - The
scan mirror 318 is controllably orientable and scans (e.g. raster scans) thebeam 336 to theeye 306 of the user of theWHUD 300. In particular, thecontrollable scan mirror 318 scans the laser light onto thetransparent combiner 304 carried by theeyeglass lens 308. Thescan mirror 318 may be a single bi-axial scan mirror or two single-axis scan mirrors may be used to scan the laser light onto thetransparent combiner 304, for example. In at least some implementations, thetransparent combiner 304 may be a holographic combiner with at least one holographic optical element. Thetransparent combiner 304 redirects the laser light towards a field of view of theeye 306 of the user. The laser light redirected towards theeye 306 of the user may be collimated by thetransparent combiner 304, wherein the spot at thetransparent combiner 304 is approximately the same size and shape as the spot at theeye 306 of the user. The laser light may be converged by theeye 306 to a focal point at the retina ofeye 306 and creates an image that is focused. The visible light may create display content in the field of view of the user, and the infrared light may illuminate theeye 306 of the user for the purpose of eye tracking. -
FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram of a wearable heads-up display (WHUD) 400 with alaser projector 402 in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods.WHUD 400 includes asupport structure 404 with the shape and appearance of a pair of eyeglasses that in use is worn on the head of the user. Thesupport structure 404 carries multiple components, includingeyeglass lens 406, atransparent combiner 408, thelaser projector 402, and a controller orprocessor 410. Thelaser projector 402 may be similar or identical to thelaser projector 302 ofFIG. 3 . For example, thelaser projector 402 may include an optical engine, such as theoptical engine 100 or theoptical engine 312. Thelaser projector 402 may be communicatively coupled to the controller 410 (e.g., microprocessor) which controls the operation of theprojector 402, as discussed above. Thecontroller 410 may include or may be communicatively coupled to a non-transitory processor-readable storage medium (e.g., memory circuits such as ROM, RAM, FLASH, EEPROM, memory registers, magnetic disks, optical disks, other storage), and the controller may execute data and/or instruction from the non-transitory processor readable storage medium to control the operation of thelaser projector 402. - In operation of the
WHUD 400, thecontroller 410 controls thelaser projector 402 to emit laser light. As discussed above with reference toFIG. 3 , thelaser projector 402 generates and directs an aggregate beam (e.g.,aggregate beam 336 ofFIG. 3 ) toward thetransparent combiner 408 via at least one controllable mirror (not shown inFIG. 4 ). The aggregate beam is directed towards a field of view of an eye of a user by thetransparent combiner 408. Thetransparent combiner 408 may collimate the aggregate beam such that the spot of the laser light incident on the eye of the user is at least approximately the same size and shape as the spot attransparent combiner 408. Thetransparent combiner 408 may be a holographic combiner that includes at least one holographic optical element. -
FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of amethod 500 of manufacturing an optical engine, in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods. Themethod 500 may be implemented to manufacture theoptical engine 100 ofFIGS. 1A-1B or theoptical engine 312 ofFIG. 3 , for example. It should be appreciated that methods of manufacturing optical engines according to the present disclosure may include fewer or additional acts than set forth in themethod 500. Further, the acts discussed below may be performed in an order different than the order presented herein. - At 502, a plurality of laser diodes may be bonded to a respective plurality of submounts. In at least some implementations, this method may be performed by an entity different than that manufacturing the optical engine. For example, in at least some implementations, one or more of the plurality of laser diodes (e.g., green laser diode, blue laser diode) may be purchased as already assembled laser CoSs. For ease of handling and simplification of the overall process, in at least some implementations it may be advantageous to also bond laser diodes that cannot be procured on submounts to a submount as well. As a non-limiting example, in at least some implementations, one or more of the laser diodes may be bonded to a corresponding submount using an eutectic gold tin (AuSn) solder process, which is flux-free and requires heating up top 280° C.
- At 504, the plurality of CoSs may be bonded to a base substrate. Alternatively, act 502 could be skipped for at least one or all of the laser diodes, and act 504 could comprise bonding the at least one or all of the laser diodes directly to the base substrate. The base substrate may be formed from a material that is RF compatible and is suitable for hermetic sealing. For example, the base substrate may be formed from low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC), aluminum nitride (AlN), alumina, Kovar®, etc. Since several CoSs are bonded next to each other on the same base substrate, it may be advantageous to either “step-solder” them sequentially or to use a bonding technique that does not rely on re-melting of solder materials. For step-soldering, each subsequent soldering step utilizes a process temperature that is less than the process temperatures of previous solder steps to prevent re-melting of solder materials. It may also be important that the laser diode-to-submount bonding does not re-melt during bonding of the CoSs to the base substrate. Bonding technologies other than step-soldering that may be used include parallel soldering of all CoS in reflow oven process, thermosonic or thermocompression bonding, transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding, laser soldering, etc. Some of these example bonding technologies are discussed below.
- For parallel soldering of all CoSs in a reflow oven process, appropriate tooling is required to assure proper bonding and alignment during the process. An advantage of this process is the parallel and hence time efficient bonding of all CoSs at once and even many assemblies in parallel. A possible disadvantage of this process is the potential loss of the alignment of components during the reflow process. Generally, a soldering cycle ideally needs a few minutes of dwell time. Preheating may be used to reduce the soldering time, which requires a few minutes for such a process depending on the thermal mass of the components being bonded. Thus, a batch process may be used with regular soldering to reduce the assembly costs with high throughput at the expense of alignment tolerance.
- For thermosonic or thermocompression bonding, thick gold metallization may be used but no extra solder layer is required. The temperatures for thermocompression bonding might be as high as 300 to 350° C. to have a good bond with a good thermal conductivity. Thermosonic bonding may be used to reduce the pressure and temperature needed for bonding, which may be required for at least some components that might not tolerate the temperatures required for thermocompression bonding.
- Transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding may also be used. There are many different reaction couples that may be used, including gold-tin, copper-tin, etc. With this method, a liquid phase is formed during the bonding which will solidify at the same temperature. The re-melting temperatures of the bond are much higher than the soldering temperatures.
- In at least some implementations, laser soldering may be used to bond some or all of the components of the optical engine. Generally, the thermal characteristic of the parts to be bonded may be important when implementing a laser soldering process.
- Subsequent reflows of solder are not recommended due to liquid phase reaction or dissolution mechanisms which may reduce the reliability of the joint. This could result in voiding at the interface or a reduction in strength of the joint itself. In order to mitigate potential reflow dissolution problems, other options can be taken into consideration, which do not rely on extreme heating of the device and can be favorable in terms of production cost. For example, bonding of the base substrate with adhesives (electrically conductive for common mass, or non-conductive for floating) may be acceptable with respect to heat transfer and out-gassing as discussed regarding partial hermetic sealing above.
- Further, in at least some implementations, a reactive multi-layer foil material (e.g., NanoFoil®) or a similar material may be used as a solder pre-form, which enables localized heat transfer. A reactive multi-layer foil material is a metallic material based on a plurality (e.g., hundreds, thousands) of reactive foils (aluminum and nickel) that enables die-attach soldering (e.g., silicon chip onto stainless steel part). In such implementations, dedicated heat transfer support metallizations may be deposited onto the two components being joined together. This method may be more advantageous for CoS-to-base substrate mounting compared to chip-to-submount bonding. Generally, bonding using reactive multi-layer foil materials enables furnace-free, low-temperature soldering of transparent or non-transparent components, without reaching the bonding temperatures for solder reflow processes. Reactive multi-layer foil materials can be patterned with a ps-laser into exact preform shapes.
- At 506, the optical director element, if included, may be bonded to the base substrate proximate the laser CoSs. The optical director element may be bonded to the base substrate using any suitable bonding process, including the bonding processes discussed above with reference to act 504.
- At 508, the laser diode driver circuit may optionally be bonded to the base substrate. As noted above, the laser diode driver circuit may be bonded to the base substrate such that the distance between the laser diode driver circuit and the laser CoSs is minimized. This may also comprise positioning a plurality of electrical connections which operatively couple the laser diode driver circuit to the plurality of laser diodes as shown in
FIGS. 11A-11E . In alternative implementations, the laser diode driver circuit may be bonded to a separate base substrate from the other components mentioned above as shown inFIGS. 11C-11E . The process used to bond the laser diode driver circuit to the base substrate may be any suitable bonding process, such as bonding processes commonly used to bond surface mount devices (SMD) to circuit boards. In other alternative implementations, the laser diode driver circuit may be mounted directly to a frame of a WHUD. For implementations where the laser diode drive circuit is not bonded to the same base substrate as the other components mentioned above, a plurality of electrical contacts and electrical connections could be bonded to the base substrate, each electrical connection operatively connecting a respective electrical contact to a respective laser diode. Subsequently, the at least one laser driver circuit could be operatively coupled to the electrical contacts, which will then electrically couple the laser diode drive circuit to the electrical connections and consequently to the laser diodes. Exemplary arrangements of electrical connections and electrical contacts is discussed later with reference toFIGS. 11C-11E . - At 510, the cap may be bonded to the base substrate to form a hermetic seal or a partial hermetic seal as discussed above between the interior volume of the encapsulated package and an exterior environment. As noted above, it may be desirable to maintain a specific atmosphere for the laser diode chips for reliability reasons. In at least some implementations, adhesive sealing may be undesirable because of the high permeability of gases. This is especially the case for blue laser diodes, which emit blue laser light that may bake contamination on facets and windows, thereby reducing transparency of the optical window. However, as detailed above regarding
FIGS. 1A and 1B , partial hermeticity, a particulate dust cover, or even no protective cover may be acceptable for certain applications. In implementations where the cap would be bonded over electrical connections which connect the at least one laser diode driver circuit to the plurality of laser diodes, such as when the at least one laser diode driver circuit is bonded to the same side of a base substrate as the laser diodes, or when the at least one laser diode driver circuit is coupled to electrical contacts bonded to the same side of the base substrate as the laser diodes, an electrically insulating cover can first be bonded to the base substrate over the electrical connections. Subsequently, the cap can be bonded at least partially to the electrically insulating cover, and potentially to a portion of the base substrate if the insulating cover does not fully encircle the intended interior volume. In this way, at least a portion of the cap will be bonded to the base substrate indirectly by being bonded to the electrically insulating cover. In some implementations, the entire cap could be bonded to the base substrate indirectly by being bonded to an electrically insulating cover which encircles the intended interior volume. Exemplary electrically insulating covers are discussed later with reference toFIGS. 11A-11E . - During the sealing process, the atmosphere may be defined by flooding the package accordingly. For example, the interior volume of the encapsulated package may be flooded with an oxygen enriched atmosphere that burns off contaminants which tend to form on interfaces where the laser beam is present. The sealing itself may also be performed so as to prevent the exchange between the package atmosphere and the environment. Due to limitations concerning the allowed sealing temperature, e.g., the components inside the package should not be influenced, in at least some implementations seam welding or laser assisted soldering/diffusion bonding may be used. In at least some implementations, localized sealing using a combination of seam welding and laser soldering may be used.
- At 512, the collimation lenses may be actively aligned. For example, once the laser diode driver circuit has been bonded and the cap has been sealed, the laser diodes can be turned on and the collimations lenses for each laser diode can be actively aligned. In at least some implementations, each of the collimation lenses may be positioned to optimize spot as well as pointing for each of the respective laser diodes.
- At 514, the beam combiner may be positioned to receive and combine individual laser beams into an aggregate beam. As discussed above, the beam combiner may include one or more diffractive optical elements and/or one or more refractive/reflective optical elements that function to combine the different color beams into an aggregate beam. The aggregate beam may be provided to other components or modules, such as a scan mirror of a laser projector, etc.

FIG. 6 is a top plan view of a photonicintegrated circuit 600 for wavelength multiplexing followed by acommon collimation lens 602 and an optional diffractiveoptical element 604. The photonicintegrated circuit 600 may be a component in an optical engine, such as anoptical engine 700 ofFIG. 7 or an optical engine ofFIG. 10 discussed further below. The photonicintegrated circuit 600 includes at least one inputoptical edge 606 having at least one input facet and at least one outputoptical edge 608 having at least one output facet. In the example ofFIG. 6 ,input edge 606 includes fourinput facets output edge 608 includes oneoutput facet 608 a. However, it is within the scope of the present systems, devices, and methods to include any appropriate number of input facets and output facets. In operation, the photonicintegrated circuit 600 receives a plurality of beams of light 610 a-610 d that are edge coupled to the photonic integrated circuit at the inputoptical edge 606 byrespective input facets 608 a-608 d, and wavelength multiplexes the plurality of beams to provide a coaxially superimposed aggregate beam oflight 612 that exits the photonic integrated circuit at the outputoptical edge 608 throughoutput facet 608 a. Generally, the photonicintegrated circuit 600 may include one or more diffractive optical elements (DOE) and/or refractive/reflective optical elements that combine the different color beams 610 a-d in order to achieve coaxial superposition. - Following out-coupling of the
aggregate beam 612 from the outputoptical edge 608 of the photonicintegrated circuit 600, the aggregated beam is collimated via thecommon collimation lens 602. In at least some implementations, thecollimation lens 602 may be either an achromatic lens or an apochromatic lens (or lens assemblies), depending on the particular optical design and tolerances of the system. In at least some implementations, one or more diffractiveoptical elements 604 may be used to provide wavelength dependent focus correction. -
FIG. 7 is a left side sectional elevational view of theoptical engine 700. Theoptical engine 700 includes several components that may be similar or identical to the components of theoptical engine 100 ofFIGS. 1A and 1B . Thus, some or all of the discussion above may be applicable to theoptical engine 700. - The
optical engine 700 includes abase substrate 702 having atop surface 704 and abottom surface 706 opposite the top surface. Thebase substrate 702 may be formed from a material that is radio frequency (RF) compatible and is suitable for hermetic sealing. For example, thebase substrate 702 may be formed from low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC), aluminum nitride (AlN), alumina, Kovar®, etc. - The
optical engine 700 also includes a plurality of chip submounts 708 (only one chip submount visible in the sectional view ofFIG. 7 ) that are bonded (e.g., attached) to thetop surface 704 of thebase substrate 702. The plurality ofchip submounts 708 are aligned in a row across a width of theoptical engine 700 between the left and right sides thereof. Each of the plurality ofchip submounts 708 includes alaser diode 710, also referred to as a laser chip or laser die, bonded thereto. In particular, an infrared chip submount carries an infrared laser diode, a red chip submount carries a red laser diode, a green chip submount carries a green laser diode, and a blue chip submount carries a blue laser diode. In operation, the infrared laser diode provides infrared laser light, the red laser diode provides red laser light, the green laser diode provides green laser light, and the blue laser diode provides blue laser light. Each of thelaser diodes 710 may comprise one of an edge emitter laser or a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL), for example. Each of the four laser diode/chip submount pairs may be referred to collectively as a “laser chip on submount,” or alaser CoS 712. Thus, theoptical engine 700 includes an infrared laser CoS, a red laser CoS, a green laser CoS, and a blue laser CoS. In at least some implementations, one or more of thelaser diodes 710 may be bonded directly to thebase substrate 702 without use of asubmount 708. - The
optical engine 700 also includes a laserdiode driver circuit 714 bonded to thebottom surface 706 of thebase substrate 702. The laserdiode driver circuit 714 is operatively coupled to the plurality oflaser diodes 710 via suitableelectrical connections 716 to selectively drive current to the plurality of laser diodes. Generally, the laserdiode driver circuit 714 may be positioned relative to theCoSs 712 to minimize the distance between the laserdiode driver circuit 714 and theCoSs 712. Although not shown inFIG. 7 , the laserdiode driver circuit 714 may be operatively coupleable to a controller (e.g., microcontroller, microprocessor, ASIC) that controls the operation of the laserdiode driver circuit 714 to selectively modulate laser light emitted by thelaser diodes 710. In at least some implementations, the laserdiode driver circuit 714 may be bonded to another portion of thebase substrate 702, such as thetop surface 704 of the base substrate, similar to the implementations shown inFIGS. 11A-11E . In at least some implementations, the laserdiode driver circuitry 714 may be remotely located and operatively coupled to thelaser diodes 710. In order to not require the use of impedance matched transmission lines, the size scale may be small compared to a wavelength (e.g., lumped element regime), where the electrical characteristics are described by (lumped) elements like resistance, inductance, and capacitance. - The
optical engine 700 also includes acap 720 that includes avertical sidewall 722 and a horizontal wall ortop portion 725. Thevertical sidewall 722 includes a lowerfirst end 724 and an uppersecond end 726 opposite the first end. Aflange 728 may be disposed around a perimeter of thesidewall 722 adjacent the lowerfirst end 724. Within a portion of thevertical sidewall 722 there is anoptical window 730 positioned proximate thelaser diodes 710 to pass light therefrom out of thecap 720. In some implementations,optical window 730 can extend frombase substrate 702 totop portion 725, such that one side ofcap 720 is formed entirely byoptical window 730. Thesidewall 722 and theoptical window 730 together define aninterior volume 732 sized and dimensioned to receive the plurality of chip submounts 708 and the plurality oflaser diodes 710. The lowerfirst end 724 and theflange 728 of thecap 720 are bonded to thebase substrate 702 to provide a hermetic seal or a partial hermetic seal between theinterior volume 732 of the cap and avolume 734 exterior to the cap. - The
cap 720 may have a round shape, rectangular shape, or other shape. Thus, thevertical sidewall 722 may comprise a continuously curved sidewall, a plurality (e.g., four) of adjacent planar portions, etc. Theoptical window 730 may comprise an entire side of thecap 720, or may comprise only a portion thereof. In at least some implementations, thecap 720 may include a plurality of optical windows instead of a singleoptical window 730. - The
optical engine 700 also includes four coupling lenses 736 (only one visible in the sectional view ofFIG. 7 ), one for each of the fourlaser diodes 710 that are bonded to thetop surface 704 of thebase substrate 702 in a row. Each of the plurality of coupling lenses 736 is positioned and oriented to receive light from a corresponding one of thelaser diodes 710 through theoptical window 730. - The coupling lenses 736 couple the beams of light 610 a-d (see
FIG. 6 ) into the photonicintegrated circuit 600 via the inputoptical edge 606. The photonicintegrated circuit 600 may be bonded to thetop surface 704 of thebase substrate 702 proximate the row of coupling lenses 736. As discussed above, in operation, the photonicintegrated circuit 600 receives a plurality of beams of light 610 a-d at the inputoptical edge 606, and wavelength multiplexes the plurality of beams to provide a coaxially superimposed aggregate beam oflight 612 that exits the photonic integrated circuit at the outputoptical edge 608. - In at least some implementations, the
laser diodes 710 may be “butt” coupled to the photonicintegrated circuit 600. In such implementations, thelaser diodes 710 may be positioned immediately adjacent to a waveguide structure (e.g., photonic integrated circuit or other waveguide structure) such that sufficient coupling (e.g., acceptable insertion loss) is achieved without the use of a coupling lens. - Following out-coupling of the
aggregate beam 612 from the outputoptical edge 608 of the photonicintegrated circuit 600, the aggregated beam may be collimated via thecommon collimation lens 602, which may be bonded to thetop surface 704 proximate the photonicintegrated circuit 600. In at least some implementations, thecollimation lens 602 may be either an achromatic lens or an apochromatic lens, depending on the particular optical design and tolerances of the system. In at least some implementations, theoptical engine 700 may include one or more diffractiveoptical elements 604 bonded to thetop surface 704 of thebase substrate 702 to provide wavelength dependent focus correction. - In at least some implementations, at least some of the components may be positioned differently. As noted above, the laser
diode driver circuit 714 may be mounted on thetop surface 704 or thebottom surface 706 of thebase substrate 702, or may be positioned remotely therefrom, depending on the RF design and other constraints (e.g., package size). In at least some implementations, theoptical engine 700 may include optical director element (e.g.,optical director element 118 ofFIG. 1 ), and the laser light may be directed from thelaser diodes 710 toward the coupling lenses 736 via an intermediate optical director element. Additionally, in at least some implementations, one or more of thelaser diodes 710 may be mounted directly on thebase substrate 702 without use of a submount. Further, in at least some implementations, in the case of an inorganic or acceptably organic waveguide (e.g., photonic integrated circuit), coupling may be accomplished inside the encapsulated package. Such feature eliminates the requirement for a separate window, as the waveguide services as the window (e.g., optical window 730). In such implementations, the at least one optical input edge of the photonic integrated circuit may be positioned inside the interior volume of the encapsulated package and the at least one optical output edge of the photonic integrated circuit may be positioned outside of the interior volume, for example. - For the sake of a controlled atmosphere inside the
interior volume 732, it may be desirable to have no organic compounds inside theinterior volume 732. In at least some implementations, the components of theoptical engine 700 may be bonded together using no adhesives. In other implementations, a low amount of adhesives may be used to bond at least one of the components, which may reduce cost while providing a relatively low risk of organic contamination for a determined lifetime (e.g., 2 or more years) of theoptical engine 700. Similarly to as detailed above regardingFIGS. 1A and 1B , partial hermeticity, a particulate dust cover, or even no protective cover may be acceptable for certain applications. Various bonding processes (e.g., attaching processes) for theoptical engine 700 are discussed above with reference toFIG. 5 . - Due to the divergent beam from each of the
laser diodes 710 and the lateral distances between the laser diodes, the coupling lenses 736, and the photonicintegrated circuit 600, it may be advantageous to minimize a distance between the respective output facets of thelaser diodes 710 and theoptical window 730. For the same reason, it may be advantageous to minimize the thickness of theoptical window 730 and the size of theflange 728 of thecap 720 so that the coupling lenses 736 can be positioned relatively close to the output facets of thelaser diodes 710. In at least some implementations,output window 730 and coupling lenses 736 could be formed as a single element. - In at least some implementations, the coupling lenses 736 and the
collimation lens 602 may be actively aligned. In at least some implementations, theCoSs 712, the cap 720 (including optical window 730), and/or the photonicintegrated circuit 600 may be passively aligned. Further, depending on the particular design, it may be advantageous to utilize asmaller base substrate 702 and use an additional carrier substrate instead. -
FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram of alaser writing system 800 in accordance with the present systems, designs and methods.Laser writing system 800 comprises at least writinglaser 810, focusingoptic 812,writeable glass 820 andtranslatable mount 830. Although the term “glass” is used herein for convenience, any appropriate laser-writable material could be used in place ofwriteable glass 820.Writing laser 810 emitslaser light 811.Laser light 811 comprises short (femtosecond and/or picosecond length) pulses of laser light; consequently,laser light 811 has extremely high peak instantaneous power. Focusingoptic 812 focuseslaser light 811 tofocal point 813.Writeable glass 820 may comprise a contiguous piece of glass or similar transparent material, which is typically transparent to thelaser light 811 emitted by the writinglaser 810; in other words the light emitted by the writing laser generally will not be absorbed by the glass via typical (linear) optical processes. At thefocal point 813, the intensity oflaser light 811 is very high due to the combination of spatial focusing (focusing the beam of writinglaser light 811 to a small point 813) and temporal focusing (emitting thelaser light 811 as extremely short femptosecond or picosecond pulses). The high intensity of light at thefocal point 813 allows nonlinear optical processes such as multiphoton absorption, avalanche ionization, Coulomb collisions (causing lattice ionization and breakdown), and heat conduction to occur in thewriteable glass 820, absorbing the light and changing the refractive index of the glass. The change in refractive index may be a positive increase in refractive index. -
Writeable glass 820 can be physically coupled totranslatable mount 830, such as by usingclamps 821, adhesive, or any other appropriate coupling mechanism. Such coupling mechanism is preferably removable, such thatwriteable glass 820 can be detached fromtranslatable mount 830 after laser writing is complete. Translation oftranslatable mount 830 in the X, Y, and/or Z direction will result in corresponding translation ofwriteable glass 820, moving the location offocal point 813 withinwriteable glass 820. Translating thewriteable glass 820 relative tofocal point 813 can create a region of changed refractive index in thewriteable glass 820. An increased refractive index in this region causes any light channeled therethrough to experience total internal reflection, thus formingwaveguide 822. In other words,waveguide 822 can be formed as a continuous path of increased refractive index withinwriteable glass 820 created bylaser light 811 atfocal point 813. - The technique of
FIG. 8 can be used to laser write at least one waveguide intowriteable glass 820. For example, a photonic integrated circuit could be written, such as photonicintegrated circuit 600 described with regards toFIG. 6 . - Writing at least one waveguide may include writing an individual waveguide for each wavelength of light impinging on the
writeable glass 820, where each waveguide comprises a respective input facet and a respective output facet. Each output facet may be positioned to provide light to other components or modules, such as a scan mirror of a laser projector, etc. In one implementation, four waveguides could be written intowriteable glass 820, one waveguide for each beam of light 610 a, 610 b, 610 c, and 610 d. - Writing at least one waveguide may include writing a waveguide combiner, wherein the waveguide combiner combines individual laser beams into a coaxially superimposed aggregate beam. Writing a waveguide combiner may include writing at least one: directional coupler (DC), Y-branch, whispering gallery mode coupler, or multi-mode interference coupler. The aggregate beam may be provided to other components or modules, such as a scan mirror of a laser projector, etc.
- In other implementations, the photonic
integrated circuit 600 may include one or more diffractive optical elements (DOE) and/or refractive/reflective optical elements that combine the different color beams 610 a-d in order to achieve coaxial superposition. - Alternatively, instead of writing a waveguide combiner, individual waveguides could be writed or written which do not strictly coaxially superimpose the beams of light, but instead bring each beam of light close together. That is, the input facet for each waveguide in the photonic integrated circuit can be positioned relatively far from the other input facets, to receive laser light from a respective laser diode, but the output facets for each of the waveguides can be positioned relatively close together. In other words, a spacing between the output facets of each waveguide can be smaller than a spacing of the input facets of each waveguide. In such an implementation, each waveguide can be optimized for performance with light of a corresponding wavelength, for example to ensure that each wavelength of light exits the photonic integrated circuit with the same divergence angle as each other wavelength. The output of each individual waveguide can be placed close enough together (on the order of 10s of microns) such that that the light output by each individual waveguide may still follow the same optical path through the rest of a projector, display, or WHUD assembly where the photonic integrated circuit is implemented.

FIG. 9 is a flow diagram of amethod 900 of manufacturing an optical engine, in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods. Themethod 900 may be implemented to manufacture theoptical engine 700 ofFIG. 7 , for example. It should be appreciated that methods of manufacturing optical engines according to the present disclosure may include fewer or additional acts than set forth in themethod 900. Further, the acts discussed below may be performed in an order different than the order presented herein. -
Method 900 can include atleast acts Acts acts method 500 inFIG. 5 , such that the disclosure of these acts with reference toFIG. 5 is also applicable toFIG. 9 . As such, the details of these acts inFIG. 9 will not be repeated in the interests of brevity. - At 912, a photonic integrated circuit is laser written in writeable glass, using for example the techniques described with regards to
FIG. 8 . The photonic integrated circuit may be similar to photonicintegrated circuit 600 described with reference toFIG. 6 . Specifically, the photonic integrated circuit can include at least one input optical edge and at least one output optical edge. In operation, the photonic integrated circuit can receive a plurality of beams of light that are edge coupled to the photonic integrated circuit at a plurality of input facets at the input optical edge, and wavelength multiplex the plurality of beams of light to provide a coaxially superimposed aggregate beam of light that exits the photonic integrated circuit at the output optical edge. Alternatively, in operation, the photonic integrated circuit can receive a plurality of beams of light that are edge coupled to the photonic integrated circuit at the input optical edge, redirect the plurality of beams of light to exit the photonic integrated circuit at the output optical edge close together. - At 914, the writeable glass including the photonic integrated circuit is bonded to the base substrate. Any appropriate bonding technique may be used, including those described with reference to
acts FIG. 5 . In some implementations, the photonic integrated circuit may be butted against an optical window of the cap, such that laser light from the laser diodes may pass through the optical window directly into the input edge of the photonic integrated circuit. Alternatively, the photonic integrated circuit may be butted directly against the cap and/or laser diodes, such that the photonic integrated circuit acts as the optical window, and laser light from the laser diodes may directly enter the input edge of the photonic integrated circuit. In certain implementations, the input edge of the photonic integrated circuit may be positioned inside an interior volume of the cap, and the output edge of the photonic integrated circuit may be positioned outside the interior volume of the cap. - In order for light to travel through a photonic integrated circuit, the light emitted by each laser diode should preferably be aligned with a respective input facet on the input edge of the photonic integrated circuit with high precision; mis-alignment of greater than 10 micrometers may significantly reduce the efficiency of the photonic integrated circuit. An output facet of each laser diode may have dimensions smaller than four square micrometers; aligning such small components to such high precision presents a non-trivial technical challenge.
- In one implementation, instead of butting the input edge of the photonic integrated circuit against the optical window of the cap, the photonic integrated circuit can be bonded to the base substrate a distance away from the optical window, and coupling lenses such as coupling lenses 736 in
FIG. 7 may be bonded to the base substrate between the optical window and the photonic integrated circuit. The coupling lenses can be aligned to couple light from each laser diode into a respective input facet at the input edge of the photonic integrated circuit. - In
act 916, a collimation lens may be provided such that a coaxially superimposed beam of light from the output edge of the photonic integrated circuit will be collimated by the collimation lens. The collimation lens may optionally optimize the spot (e.g., circularize) the coaxially superimposed beam. In some implementations, more than one collimation lens may be provided if the light output from the photonic integrated circuit is not a fully coaxially superimposed beam. The collimation lens or lenses may be actively aligned after the other components are assembled, or may be passively aligned such that appropriate alignment is achieved during assembly. - As mentioned above, aligning a photonic integrated circuit such that each input facet on an input edge of the photonic integrated circuit lines up with a beam of light emitted by each laser diode with high-precision presents a non-trivial challenge. The present systems, devices, and methods provide a solution to this challenge, by producing photonic integrated circuits where the fabrication process includes an alignment process, obviating the need for a later mechanical alignment process, as discussed below with reference to
FIG. 10 . Direct laser writing (DLW) as disclosed herein is a process by which photonic integrated circuits may be fabricated with high precision that allows for intrinsic alignment. -
FIG. 10 is a left side sectional view of photonic integratedcircuit writing system 1000. Photonic integratedcircuit writing system 1000 includes components that may be substantively similar to components ofoptical engine 700 and components oflaser writing system 800. Unless context below dictates otherwise, the disclosure of components inFIG. 7 andFIG. 8 is applicable to similarly numbered components inFIG. 10 and will not be repeated in the interests of brevity. Photonic integratedcircuit writing system 1000 includeslaser writing system 800, which, during operation, writes a photonic integrated circuit in a block ofwriteable glass 820 in a manner similar to the operation oflaser writing system 800 described above with reference toFIG. 8 . Photonic integratedcircuit writing system 1000 can be utilized to manufacture an optical engine using a process that is similar in at least some respects tomethod 900 ofFIG. 9 , but with photonic integratedcircuit writing system 1000, act 914 can be performed beforeact 912, as detailed below. -
Writeable glass 820 is bonded tobase substrate 702 prior to writing a photonic integrated circuit therein, using any of the bonding techniques discussed above. Thewriteable glass 820 may comprise a contiguous piece of glass or similar transparent material that undergoes a change in refractive index when exposed to high-intensity laser light. Bonding the writeable glass to the base substrate includes positioning and orienting thewriteable glass 820 relative to eachlaser diode 710 to place thewriteable glass 820 in the path of the beam of light emitted by eachlaser diode 710, such that the beam of light emitted by eachlaser diode 710 impinges on an input edge of the writeable glass. -
Writeable glass 820 can be butted up againstoptical window 730, such that beams of light fromlaser diodes 710 passes throughoptical window 730 directly intowriteable glass 820. Alternatively, thewriteable glass 820 may optionally formoptical window 730. Further,writeable glass 820 may be bonded directly to at least one of thelaser diodes 710 and/or at least onelaser CoS 712. - The
entire base substrate 702 and all components bonded thereto can be physically coupled totranslatable mount 830, such as withclamps 821, adhesives, and/or any other appropriate coupling mechanism. Such coupling mechanism is preferably removable, such thatbase substrate 702 and all components bonded thereto can be detached fromtranslatable mount 830 after laser writing ofwriteable glass 820 is complete. - With
writeable glass 820 bonded tobase substrate 702 andbase substrate 702 physically coupled totranslatable mount 830, at least onewaveguide 822 can be laser written intowriteable glass 820 by translatingbase substrate 702 and all components thereon usingtranslatable mount 830. Consequently,writeable glass 820 becomes a photonic integrated circuit. - To determine where the at least one
waveguide 822 should be written,laser diodes 710 could be activated, thus causing beams of light therefrom to impinge on an input edge ofwriteable block 820.Writing laser 810 can be aligned to directly write waveguides at the exact location where the beams of light fromlaser diodes 710 impinge on thewriteable block 820. In this way, the input of the resulting photonic integrated circuit will be accurately aligned with the laser diodes, ensuring efficient incoupling of the beams of light into the photonic integrated circuit. - Alternatively, the
writeable glass 820 could be illuminated, such as by being backlit ifbase substrate 702 is at least partially transparent.Writing laser 810 can then be aligned to directly write waveguides at locations where shadows oflaser diodes 710 and/or CoS's 712 appear. In this way, the input of the resulting photonic integrated circuit will be accurately aligned with the laser diodes, ensuring efficient incoupling of the beams of light into the photonic integrated circuit. - Aligning the input facets of the photonic integrated circuit to the beams of light during the writing stage will be more accurate than trying to mechanically align a pre-fabricated photonic integrated circuit, due to deviations that can arise in the bonding processes of not only the pre-fabricated photonic integrate circuit, but also the laser diodes. As one example, if each of four laser diodes is randomly misaligned, it would be difficult to align a prefabricated photonic integrated circuit to match the beam of light from each diode, since not only could the photonic integrated circuit be misaligned during the bonding processes, but also the spacing between each laser diode may not match the spacing between each waveguide in the photonic integrated circuit due to the random misalignment of each of the laser diodes. Direct laser writing the photonic integrated circuit after all of the components have been mechanically bonded obviates these issues, by allowing the position and spacing of each laser diode relative to the writeable glass to be accounted for after bonding is complete.
- In some implementations, a photonic integrated circuit could be manufactured using a combination of the techniques described with reference to
FIGS. 8, 9, and 10 , as discussed below. - In one example, a large portion of a photonic integrated circuit could be first written, except for a small portion of the photonic integrated circuit at the input edge of writeable glass. Subsequently, the photonic integrated circuit could be bonded to a base substrate such as in
FIG. 10 , and the remaining small portion of the photonic integrated circuit at the input edge of the writeable glass could be written to couple the output of each laser diode to the portion of the photonic integrated circuit which is already written. - In another example, a first photonic integrated circuit could be written as in
FIG. 8 . Subsequently, the first photonic integrated circuit could be bonded to a base substrate similar to inFIG. 7 , with a gap between the optical window and the input edge of the first photonic integrated circuit. In the gap between the optical window and the photonic integrated circuit, instead of positioning coupling lenses, a block of writeable glass could be bonded to the base substrate. Subsequently, a second photonic integrated circuit could be written in the writeable glass similar to inFIG. 10 to couple the output of each laser diode to the input edge of the previously written photonic integrated circuit. In this example, the block of writeable glass could be formed as the optical window, and/or could be formed to cover a portion of the first photonic integrate circuit. - In some implementations, an optical engine similar to
optical engine 700 may include abeam combiner 316 as described with regards toFIG. 3 in place of photonicintegrated circuit 600.FIG. 11A illustrates an exemplary optical engine 1100 in this regard. -
FIG. 11A is a top side sectional elevational view ofoptical engine 1100 a. The optical engine 1100 includes several components that may be similar or identical to the components of theoptical engine 100 ofFIGS. 1A and 1B and/or theoptical engine 700 ofFIG. 7 . Thus, some or all of the discussion above may be applicable to theoptical engine 1100 a. - The
optical engine 1100 a includes abase substrate 1102. Thebase substrate 1102 may be formed from a material that is radio frequency (RF) compatible and is suitable for hermetic sealing. For example, thebase substrate 1102 may be formed from low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC), aluminum nitride (AlN), alumina, Kovar®, etc. - The
optical engine 1100 a also includes a plurality of chip submounts 1108 a, 1108 b, 1108 c, and 1108 d that are bonded (e.g., attached) to thebase substrate 1102. The plurality of chip submounts 1108 a, 1108 b, 1108 c, and 1108 d are aligned in a row across a width of the optical engine 1100 between the left and right sides thereof. Each of the plurality of chip submounts 1108 a, 1108 b, 1108 c, and 1108 d includes arespective laser diode infrared chip submount 1108 d carries aninfrared laser diode 1110 d, ared chip submount 1108 a carries ared laser diode 1110 a, agreen chip submount 1108 b carries agreen laser diode 1110 b, and ablue chip submount 1108 c carries ablue laser diode 1110 c. In operation, theinfrared laser diode 1110 d providesinfrared laser light 1138 d, thered laser diode 1110 a provides red laser light 1138 a, thegreen laser diode 1110 b provides green laser light 1138 b, and theblue laser diode 1110 c providesblue laser light 1138 c. Each of thelaser diodes optical engine 1100 a includes aninfrared laser CoS 1112 d, ared laser CoS 1112 a, agreen laser CoS 1112 b, and ablue laser CoS 1112 c. In at least some implementations, one or more of thelaser diodes base substrate 1102 without use of a submount, as described above with reference to act 504 inFIG. 5 . - The
optical engine 1100 a also includes a laserdiode driver circuit 1114 bonded to thebase substrate 1102. InFIG. 11A , laserdiode driver circuit 1114 is illustrated as being bonded to a top surface ofbase substrate 1102, but in at least some implementations, the laserdiode driver circuit 1114 may be bonded to another portion of thebase substrate 1102, such as a bottom surface of thebase substrate 1102. The laserdiode driver circuit 1114 is operatively coupled to the plurality oflaser diodes electrical connections diode driver circuit 1114 may be positioned relative to theCoSs diode driver circuit 1114 and theCoSs FIG. 11A , the laserdiode driver circuit 1114 may be operatively coupleable to a controller (e.g., microcontroller, microprocessor, ASIC) that controls the operation of the laserdiode driver circuit 1114 to selectively modulate laser light emitted by thelaser diodes diode driver circuitry 1114 may be remotely located and operatively coupled to thelaser diodes - The
optical engine 1100 a also includes acap 1120, which can be similar to cap 720 as discussed regardingFIG. 7 . Within a portion of thecap 1120 there is anoptical window 1130 positioned proximate thelaser diodes cap 1120. Thecap 1120 andoptical window 1130 define aninterior volume 1132 sized and dimensioned to receive the plurality of chip submounts 1108 a, 1108 b, 1108 c, 1108 d and the plurality oflaser diodes Cap 1120 is bonded to thebase substrate 1102 to provide a hermetic seal or a partial hermetic seal between theinterior volume 1132 of the cap and a volume exterior to the cap. - The
cap 1120 may have a round shape, rectangular shape, or other shape. Theoptical window 1130 may comprise an entire side of thecap 1120, or may comprise only a portion thereof. In at least some implementations, thecap 1120 may include a plurality of optical windows instead of a singleoptical window 1130. - The optical engine 1100 also includes four collimation/
pointing lenses respective laser diode base substrate 1102 in a row. Each of the plurality ofcollimation lenses laser diodes optical window 1130. - The
collimation lenses optical elements beam combiner 316.Beam combiner 316 inFIG. 11A could be similar tobeam combiner 316 illustrated inFIG. 3 , such that the description regardingFIG. 3 can be applicable to thebeam combiner 316 inFIG. 11A . Thebeam combiner 316 may be bonded to thebase substrate 1102 proximate the row ofcollimation lenses FIG. 3 , in operation,beam combiner 316 receives a plurality of beams of light 1138 a, 1138 b, 1138 c, and 1138 d and combines the plurality of beams to provide a coaxially superimposed aggregate beam oflight 336. - In at least some implementations, at least some of the components may be positioned differently. As noted above, the laser
diode driver circuit 1114 may be mounted on a top surface or a bottom surface of thebase substrate 1102, or may be positioned remotely therefrom, depending on the RF design and other constraints (e.g., package size). In at least some implementations, theoptical engine 1100 a may include an optical director element (e.g.,optical director element 118 ofFIG. 1 ), and the laser light may be directed from thelaser diodes collimation lenses laser diodes base substrate 1102 without use of a submount. - For the sake of a controlled atmosphere inside the
interior volume 1132, it may be desirable to have no organic compounds inside theinterior volume 1132. In at least some implementations, the components of the optical engine 1100 may be bonded together using no adhesives. In other implementations, a low amount of adhesives may be used to bond at least one of the components, which may reduce cost while providing a relatively low risk of organic contamination for a determined lifetime (e.g., 2 or more years) of the optical engine 1100. Similarly to as detailed above regardingFIGS. 1A and 1B , partial hermeticity, a particulate dust cover, or even no protective cover may be acceptable for certain applications. Various bonding processes (e.g., attaching processes) for theoptical engine 1100 a are discussed above with reference toFIG. 5 . - Due to the divergent beam from each of the
laser diodes collimation lenses beam combiner 316, it may be advantageous to minimize a distance between the respective output facets of thelaser diodes optical window 1130. For the same reason, it may be advantageous to minimize the thickness of theoptical window 1130 so that thecollimation lenses laser diodes - In at least some implementations, the
collimation lenses CoSs beam combiner 316 may be passively aligned. - Depending on the particular design, it may be advantageous to utilize a
smaller base substrate 1102 and use at least one additional carrier substrate to carry one or both of thecollimation lenses beam combiner 316 instead. -
FIG. 11A also illustrates an insulatingcover 1140 overelectrical connections cap 1120 can be formed of a conductive material, insulatingcover 1140 prevents electrical signals which run throughelectrical connections cap 1120.FIG. 11B is an isometric view showing insulatingcover 1140 in more detail. InFIG. 11B ,CoSs diode driver circuitry 1114 by a respectiveelectrical connection Electrical connections base substrate 1102. Insulatingcover 1140 is placed, adhered, formed, or otherwise positioned overelectrical connections electrical connections cover 1140.Cap 1120 is placed, adhered, formed, or otherwise positioned over insulatingcover 1140, such thatcap 1120 does not contact any of theelectrical connections cap 1120 is shown as being transparent inFIG. 11B , though this is not necessarily the case, andcap 1120 can be formed of an opaque material. Insulatingcover 1140 can be formed of a material with low electrical permittivity such as a ceramic, such that electrical signals which run throughelectrical connections cover 1140. In this way, electrical signals which run throughelectrical connections cap 1120, which can be formed of an electrically conductive material. AlthoughFIG. 11B shows insulatingcover 1140 as extending along only part of a side ofcap 1120, one skilled in the art will appreciate that insulatingcover 1140 can extend along an entire side length ofcap 1120. - One skilled in the art will appreciate that the positions of laser
diode driver circuitry 1114,electrical connections cover 1140 as shown inFIGS. 11A and 11B could also be applied in other implementations of the subject systems, devices and methods. For example, in the implementation ofFIGS. 1A and 1B , laserdiode driver circuitry 114 could be positioned ontop surface 104 ofbase substrate 102, andelectrical connections 116 could run acrosstop surface 104 under an insulating cover, such thatelectrical connections 116 do not contact any conductive portion ofcap 120. Similarly, in the implementations ofFIGS. 7 and 10 , laserdiode driver circuitry 714 could be positioned ontop surface 704 ofbase substrate 702, andelectrical connections 716 could run acrosstop surface 704 under an insulating cover, such thatelectrical connections 716 do not contact any conductive portion ofcap 720. -
FIGS. 11C, 11D, and 11E illustrate alternative implementations of theoptical engine 1100 a shown inFIGS. 11A and 11B . One skilled in the art will appreciate that, unless context clearly dictates otherwise, the description ofFIGS. 11A and 11B is applicable to the implementations ofFIGS. 11C, 11D, and 11E . -
FIG. 11C is a top side sectional elevational view of anoptical engine 1100 c similar tooptical engine 1100 a ofFIG. 11A . Theoptical engine 1100 c includes abase substrate 1103. Similar tobase substrate 1102 inFIG. 11A ,base substrate 1103 may be formed from a material that is radio frequency (RF) compatible and is suitable for hermetic sealing. For example, thebase substrate 1103 may be formed from low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC), alumina, Kovar®, etc. - One difference between
optical engine 1100 c inFIG. 11C andoptical engine 1100 a inFIG. 11A relates to what components are bonded (e.g. attached) tobase substrate 1103. Inoptical engine 1100 c, each of:CoSs cap 1120;optical window 1130;electrical connections cover 1140 are bonded (e.g., attached) tobase substrate 1103. However, laserdiode driver circuit 1114,collimation lenses beam combiner 316 are not necessarily bonded directly tobase substrate 1103. Instead, any of these of these components could be bonded to a separate base substrate. For example, each of laserdiode driver circuit 1114,collimation lenses beam combiner 316 could be bonded to separate base substrates. As another example,collimation lenses beam combiner 316 could be bonded a first separate base substrate, and laserdiode drive circuit 1114 could be bonded to a second separate base substrate. As another example,collimation lenses diode drive circuit 1114 could be bonded to a second separate substrate, andbeam combiner 316 could be bonded to a third separate substrate. Further, it is also within the scope of the subject systems, devices, and methods for at least some of laserdiode drive circuit 1114,collimation lenses beam combiner 316 to be bonded tobase substrate 1103. As an example, laserdiode drive circuit 1114 could be bonded tobase substrate 1103, butcollimation lenses beam combiner 316 could be bonded to a separate base substrate. As another example,collimation lenses beam combiner 316 could be bonded tobase substrate 1103, but laserdiode drive circuit 1114 could be bonded to a separate base substrate. As another example,collimation lenses base substrate 1103, but laserdiode drive circuit 1114 could be bonded to a first separate base substrate, and beam combiner 314 could be bonded to a second separate base substrate. Further,beam combiner 316,collimation lenses diode drive circuit 1114 may not need to be bonded to a substrate at all, and could simply be mounted directly within a frame of a WHUD. - For the cases where laser
diode drive circuit 1114 is not bonded tobase substrate 1103,electrical contacts base substrate 1103, each at an end of a respectiveelectrical connection electrical contacts diode drive circuit 1114 toelectrical connections -
FIG. 11D is a top side sectional elevational view of anoptical engine 1100 d similar tooptical engine 1100 a ofFIG. 11A andoptical engine 1100 c ofFIG. 11C .Optical engine 1100 d includes abeam combiner 317 which is similar tobeam combiner 316 as shown inFIGS. 11A and 11C , but bigger in size relative to the other components ofFIG. 11D .Beam combiner 317 functions to produce anaggregate beam 337 in a similar manner to howbeam combiner 316 producesaggregate beam 336 as disclosed regardingFIGS. 3A and 3B , such that the descriptions throughout this application pertaining tobeam combiner 316 are applicable tobeam combiner 317. Further, the descriptions pertaining tooptical elements beam combiner 316 are applicable tooptical elements beam combiner 317. - In
optical engine 1100 d ofFIG. 11D ,beam combiner 317 is large in size relative to the other components of theFIG. 11D , such that eachlight beam optical element collimation lens respective light beam optical element collimation lens collimation lens collimation lens -
FIG. 11E is a top side sectional elevational view of anoptical engine 1100 e similar tooptical engine 1100 a ofFIG. 11A ,optical engine 1100 c ofFIG. 11C , andoptical engine 1100 d ofFIG. 11D .Optical engine 1100 e includes acollimation lens 1137 positioned near an output side ofbeam combiner 316. In one implementation,collimation lens 1137 could replacecollimation lenses enter beam combiner 316, andcollimation lens 1137 collimatesaggregate beam 336 output frombeam combiner 316. In another implementation,collimation lens 1137 could be in addition tocollimation lenses enter beam combiner 316, andcollimation lens 1137 fully collimates and/or correctsaggregate beam 336 output frombeam combiner 316. - One skilled in the art will appreciate that even though
FIGS. 11D and 11E show optical engines havingbase substrate 1103 with only a subset of components bonded thereto, the implementations ofFIGS. 11D and 11E could utilize any of the base substrate implementations illustrated or discussed with regards toFIG. 11C , as well as the base substrate implementation illustrated and discussed with regards toFIG. 11A . Further, it is within the scope of the present systems, devices, and methods that any of the implementations discussed herein could utilize any appropriate base substrate implementations illustrated or discussed with regards toFIG. 11C . - Throughout this application, many collimation lenses are represented in the Figures by a simple curved lens shape. However, the subject systems, devices, and methods can utilize more advanced collimation schemes, as appropriate for a given application.
-
FIG. 12 shows an exemplary situation where using an advanced collimation scheme would be helpful.FIG. 12 is an isometric view of alaser diode 1200. Thelaser diode 1200 may be similar or identical to the various laser diodes discussed herein. Thelaser diode 1200 outputs alaser light beam 1202 via anoutput facet 1204 of the laser diode.FIG. 12 shows the divergence of the light 1202 emitting from thelaser diode 1200. As shown, thelight beam 1202 may diverge by a substantial amount along a fast axis 1206 (or perpendicular axis) and by a lesser amount in the slow axis 1208 (parallel axis). As a non-limiting example, in at least some implementations, thelight beam 1202 may diverge with full width half maximum (FWHM) angles of up to 40 degrees in thefast axis direction 1206 and up to 10 degrees in theslow axis direction 1208. This divergence results in a rapidly expanding elliptical cone. -
FIGS. 13A and 13B show an exemplary collimation scheme that can be used to circularize and collimate an elliptical beam such as that shown inFIG. 12 .FIG. 13A illustrates an orthogonal view of thefast axis 1206 oflight beam 1202 emitted fromlaser diode 1200.FIG. 13B illustrates an orthogonal view of theslow axis 1208 oflight beam 1202 emitted fromlaser diode 1200. As shown inFIG. 13A , afirst lens 1300 collimateslight beam 1202 alongfast axis 1206. As shown inFIG. 13B ,first lens 1300 is shaped so as to not substantially influencelight beam 1202 alongslow axis 1208. Subsequently, as shown inFIG. 13B ,light beam 1202 is collimated alongslow axis 1208 by asecond lens 1302. As shown inFIG. 13A ,second lens 1302 is shaped so as to not substantially influencelight beam 1202 alongfast axis 1206. In essence,light beam 1202 is collimated alongfast axis 1206 separately fromslow axis 1208. By collimatinglight beam 1202 alongfast axis 1206 separately fromslow axis 1208, the collimation power applied to each axis can be independently controlled by controlling the power oflens 1300 andlens 1302 separately. Further, spacing between each oflaser diode 1200,lens 1300, andlens 1302 can be controlled to collimatelight beam 1202 to a certain width in each axis separately. Iflight beam 1202 is collimated alongfast axis 1206 to the same width asslow axis 1208,light beam 1202 can be circularized. Becauselight beam 1202 will typically diverge faster in thefast axis 1206, it is generally preferable to collimatelight beam 1202 alongfast axis 1206 first, then collimatelight beam 1202 alongslow axis 1208 after. However, it is possible in certain applications to collimatelight beam 1202 alongslow axis 1208 first, and subsequently collimatelight beam 1202 alongfast axis 1206 after. This can be achieved by reversing the order offirst lens 1300 withsecond lens 1302, with respect to the path of travel oflight beam 1202. -
FIGS. 13C and 13D are isometric views which illustrate exemplary shapes forlenses lens FIG. 13C , a full cylinder as inFIG. 13D , a quarter cylinder, a three-quarter cylinder, any other partial cylinder, or any other appropriate shape.Lens -
FIGS. 14A and 14B illustrate an alternative collimation scheme.FIG. 14A illustrates an orthogonal view of thefast axis 1206 oflight beam 1202 emitted fromlaser diode 1200.FIG. 14B illustrates an orthogonal view of theslow axis 1208 oflight beam 1202 emitted fromlaser diode 1200. As shown inFIG. 14A , afirst lens 1400 redirectslight beam 1202 alongfast axis 1206, to reduce divergence oflight beam 1202 alongfast axis 1206. As shown inFIG. 14B ,first lens 1400 is shaped so as to not substantially influencelight beam 1202 alongslow axis 1208. Preferably,first lens 1400 will reduce divergence oflight beam 1202 alongfast axis 1206 to match divergence oflight beam 1202 alongslow axis 1208. That is,first lens 1400 preferably circularizeslight beam 1202. Subsequently, as shown inFIGS. 14A and 14B ,light beam 1202 is collimated along bothfast axis 1206 andslow axis 1208 by asecond lens 1402. As shown inFIGS. 14A and 14B ,second lens 1402 is shaped similarly with respect to both thefast axis 1206 and theslow axis 1208, to evenly collimatelight beam 1202. In essence,first lens 1400 circularizeslight beam 1202, and subsequentlysecond lens 1402 collimateslight beam 1202 along both axes.First lens 1400 can for example be shaped similarly tolens 1300 orlens 1302 discussed above, and shown inFIGS. 14C and 14D .Second lens 1402 can for example be shaped as a double convex lens as illustrated inFIG. 14C , or a single convex lens (convex on either side) as illustrated inFIG. 14D , or any other appropriate collimating lens. - The collimation schemes illustrated in
FIGS. 13A-13D and 14A-14D , and discussed above could be used in place of any of the collimation lenses described herein, including atleast collimation lenses collimation lens 602, and coupling lenses 736. - A person of skill in the art will appreciate that the teachings of the present systems, methods, and devices may be modified and/or applied in additional applications beyond the specific WHUD implementations described herein.
