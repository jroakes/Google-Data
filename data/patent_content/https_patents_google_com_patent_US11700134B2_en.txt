- server 135 may be a third party server, e.g., controlled by an entity different than the entity that provides messaging application 103 a / 103 b .
- server 135 provides or hosts bots.
- a bot is an automated service, implemented on one or more computers, that users interact with primarily through text, e.g., via messaging application 103 a / 103 b .
- a bot may be implemented by a bot provider such that the bot can interact with users of various messaging applications.
- a provider of messaging application 103 a / 103 b may also provide one or more bots.
- bots provided by the provider of messaging application 103 a / 103 b may be configured such that the bots can be included in other messaging applications, e.g., provided by other providers.
- a bot may provide several advantages over other modes.
- a bot may permit a user to try a new service (e.g., a taxi booking service, a restaurant reservation service, etc.) without having to install an application on a client device, or accessing a web site.
- a user may interact with a bot via text, which requires minimal or no learning, compared with that required to use a website, software application, a telephone call, e.g., to an interactive voice response (IVR) service, or other manners of interacting with a service.
- IVR interactive voice response
- Incorporating a bot within a messaging service or application may also permit users to collaborate with other users to accomplish various tasks such as travel planning, shopping, scheduling events, obtaining information, etc. within the messaging service, and eliminate cumbersome operations such as switching between various applications (e.g., a taxi booking application, a restaurant reservation application, a calendar application, etc.) or websites to accomplish the tasks.
- a bot may be implemented as a computer program or application (e.g., a software application) that is configured to interact with one or more users (e.g., any of the users 125 a - n ) via messaging application 103 a / 103 b to provide information or to perform specific actions within the messaging application 103 .
- an information retrieval bot may search for information on the Internet and present the most relevant search result within the messaging app.
- a travel bot may have the ability to make travel arrangements via messaging application 103 , e.g., by enabling purchase of travel and hotel tickets within the messaging app, making hotel reservations within the messaging app, making rental car reservations within the messaging app, and the like.
- a taxi bot may have the ability to call a taxi, e.g., to the user's location (obtained by the taxi bot from client device 115 , when a user 125 permits access to location information) without having to invoke or call a separate taxi reservation app.
- a coach/tutor bot may tutor a user to instruct the user in some subject matter within a messaging app, e.g., by asking questions that are likely to appear on an examination and providing feedback on whether the user's responses were correct or incorrect.
- a game bot may play a game on the opposite side or the same side as a user within a messaging app.
- a commercial bot may provide services from a specific merchant, e.g., by retrieving product information from the merchant's catalog and enabling purchase through a messaging app.
- an interface bot may interface a remote device or vehicle so that a user of a messaging app can chat with, retrieve information from, and/or provide instructions to the remote device or vehicle.
- a bot's capabilities may include understanding a user's intent and executing on it.
- the user's intent may be understood by analyzing and understanding the user's conversation and its context.
- a bot may also understand the changing context of a conversation or the changing sentiments and/or intentions of the users based on a conversation evolving over time. For example, if user A suggests meeting for coffee but if user B states that he does not like coffee, then a bot may assign a negative sentiment score for coffee to user B and may not suggest a coffee shop for the meeting.
- Implementing bots that can communicate with users of messaging application 103 a / 103 b may provide many advantages.
- a user may utilize a software application or a web site to perform activities such as paying bills, ordering food, booking tickets, etc.
- a problem with such implementations is that a user is required to install or use multiple software applications, and websites, in order to perform the multiple activities. For example, a user may have to install different software applications to pay a utility bill (e.g., from the utility company), to buy movie tickets (e.g., a ticket reservation application from a ticketing service provider), to make restaurant reservations (e.g., from respective restaurants), or may need to visit a respective website for each activity.
- a utility bill e.g., from the utility company
- movie tickets e.g., a ticket reservation application from a ticketing service provider
- restaurant reservations e.g., from respective restaurants
- the user may need to learn a complex user interface, e.g., a user interface implemented using multiple user interface elements
- an advantage of one or more described implementations is that a single application enables a user to perform activities that involve interaction with any number of parties, without being required to access a separate website or install and run software applications, which has a technical effect of reducing consumption of memory, storage, and processing resources on a client device.
- An advantage of the described implementations is that the conversational interface makes it easier and faster for the user to complete such activities, e.g., without having to learn a complex user interface, which has a technical effect of reducing consumption of computational resources.
- Another advantage of the described implementations is that implementing bots may enable various participating entities to provide user interaction at a lower cost, which has a technical effect of reducing the need for computational resources that are deployed to enable user interaction, such as a toll-free number implemented using one or more of a communications server, a web site that is hosted on one or more web servers, a customer support email hosted on an email server, etc.
- Another technical effect of described features is a reduction in the problem of consumption of system processing and transmission resources required for completing user tasks across communication networks.
- a bot may also be configured to interact with another bot (e.g., bots 107 a / 107 b , 109 a / 109 b , 111 , 113 , etc.) via messaging application 103 , via direct communication between bots, or a combination.
- another bot e.g., bots 107 a / 107 b , 109 a / 109 b , 111 , 113 , etc.
- messaging application 103 via direct communication between bots, or a combination.
- a restaurant reservation bot may interact with a bot for a particular restaurant in order to reserve a table.
- a bot may use a conversational interface to use natural language to interact conversationally with a user.
- a bot may use a template-based format to create sentences with which to interact with a user, e.g., in response to a request for a restaurant address, using a template such as “the location of restaurant R is L.”
- a user may be enabled to select a bot interaction format, e.g., whether the bot is to use natural language to interact with the user, whether the bot is to use template-based interactions, etc.
- the content and/or style of the bot's interactions may dynamically vary based on one or more of: the content of the conversation determined using natural language processing, the identities of the users in the conversations, and one or more conversational contexts (e.g., historical information on the user's interactions, connections between the users in the conversation based on a social graph), external conditions (e.g., weather, traffic), the user's schedules, related context associated with the users, and the like.
- the content and style of the bot's interactions is varied based on only such factors for which users participating in the conversation have provided consent.
- a bot may also interact within that conversation using formal language, and vice versa.
- formal language e.g., no or minimal slang terms or emojis
- a bot may also interact with that user using one or more emojis.
- a bot may use more formal language in that conversation.
- the content and style of interaction of the bot may be a default style, e.g., a neutral style, that doesn't require utilization of such factors.
- one or more bots may include functionality to engage in a back-and-forth conversation with a user. For example, if the user requests information about movies, e.g., by entering “@moviebot Can you recommend a movie?”, the bot “moviebot” may respond with “Are you in the mood for a comedy?” The user may then respond, e.g., “nope” to which the bot may respond with “OK. The sci-fi movie entitled Space and Stars has got great reviews. Should I book you a ticket?” The user may then indicate “Yeah, I can go after 6 pm. Please check if Steve can join”. Upon user's consent to the bot accessing information about their contacts and upon the friend Steve's consent to receiving messages from the bot, the bot may send a message to user's friend Steve and perform further actions to book movie tickets at a suitable time.
- the bot may send a message to user's friend Steve and perform further actions to book movie tickets at a suitable time.
- a user participating in a conversation may be enabled to invoke a specific bot or a bot performing a specific task, e.g., by typing a bot name or bot handle (e.g., taxi, @taxibot, @movies, etc.), by using a voice command (e.g., “invoke bankbot”, etc.), by activation of a user interface element (e.g., a button or other element labeled with the bot name or handle), etc.
- a user 125 may send a message to the bot via messaging application 103 a / 103 b in a manner similar to sending messages to other users 125 .
- a user may type “@taxibot get me a cab”; to make hotel reservations, a user may type “@hotelbot book a table for 4 at a Chinese restaurant near me.”
- a bot may automatically suggest information or actions within a messaging conversation without being specifically invoked. That is, the users may not need to specifically invoke the bot.
- the bot may depend on analysis and understanding of the conversation on a continual basis or at discrete points of time. The analysis of the conversation may be used to understand specific user needs and to identify when assistance should be suggested by a bot.
- a bot may search for some information and suggest the answer if it is determined that a user needs information (e.g., based on the user asking a question to another user, based on multiple users indicating they don't have some information).
- a bot may automatically suggest a set of Chinese restaurants in proximity to the users, including optional information such as locations, ratings and links to the websites of the restaurants.
- an automatic suggestion may be made to one or more users in a messaging conversation to invoke one or more bots.
- the conversation may be analyzed on a continual basis or at discrete points of time, and the analysis of the conversation may be used to understand specific user needs and to identify when a bot should be suggested within the conversation.
- a bot may automatically suggest information or actions within a messaging conversation without being specifically invoked
- such functionality is disabled, e.g., if one or more users participating in the messaging conversation do not provide consent to a bot performing analysis of the users' conversation.
- such functionality may also be disabled temporarily based on user input. For example, when the users indicate that a conversation is private or sensitive, analysis of conversational context is suspended until users provide input for the bot to be activated. Further, indications that analysis functionality is disabled may be provided to participants in the conversation, e.g., with a user interface element.
- a bot may be implemented in a variety of configurations.
- bot 105 is implemented on client device 115 a .
- the bot may be a module in a software application that is local to client device 115 a .
- bot functionality may be incorporated as a module in the taxi hailing application.

- bot 107 a is shown implemented on client device 115 a and bot 107 b is shown as implemented on messaging server 101 .
- the bot may be implemented, e.g., as a client-server computer program, with portions of the bot functionality provided by each of bot 107 a (server module) and bot 107 b (client module).
- server module a scheduling bot with the handle @calendar
- client module a reminder, by typing “@calendar remind me to pick up laundry in the evening,” which may be handled by bot 107 b (client module).
- bot 107 a may contact user Jim (or Jim's scheduling bot) to exchange messages, and provide a response to user 115 a.
- bot 109 a (server module) is implemented on server 135 and bot 109 b (client module) is implemented on client devices 115 .
- the bot functionality is provided by modules implemented on client devices 115 and server 135 , which is distinct from messaging server 101 .
- a bot may be implemented as a distributed application, e.g., with modules distributed across multiple client devices and servers (e.g., client devices 115 , server 135 , messaging server 101 , etc.).
- a bot may be implemented as a server application, e.g., bot 111 that is implemented on messaging server 101 and bot 113 that is implemented on server 135 .
- client-only implementations permit bot functionality to be provided locally, e.g., without network access, which may be advantageous in certain contexts, e.g., when a user is outside of network coverage area or in any area with low or limited network bandwidth.
- Implementations that include one or more servers, such as server-only, client-server, or distributed configurations may permit certain functionality, e.g., financial transactions, ticket reservations, etc. that may not be possible to provide locally on a client device.
- FIG. 1 shows bots as distinct from messaging application 103
- one or more bots may be implemented as part of messaging application 103 .
- user permission is obtained before implementing bots.
- messaging application 103 a / 103 b may provide bots that can perform certain activities, e.g., a translation bot that translates incoming and outgoing messages, a scheduling bot that schedules events on a user's calendar, etc.
- translation bot is activated only upon user's specific permission.
- bots within messaging application 103 a / 103 b are not implemented (e.g., disabled, removed, etc.). If the user provides consent, a bot or messaging application 103 a / 103 b may make limited use of messages exchanged between users via messaging application 103 a / 103 b to provide specific functionality, e.g., translation, scheduling, etc.
- third parties distinct from a provider of messaging application 103 a / 103 b and users 125 may provide bots that can communicate with users 125 via messaging application 103 a / 103 b for specific purposes.
- a taxi service provider may provide a taxi bot
- a ticketing service may provide a bot that can book event tickets
- a bank bot may provide capability to conduct financial transactions, etc.
- bots are permitted to communicate with users only upon specific user authorization. For example, if a user invokes a bot, the bot can reply, e.g., based on the user's action of invoking the bot.
- a user may indicate particular bots or types of bots that may contact the user.
- a user may permit travel bots to communicate with her, but not provide authorization for shopping bots.
- messaging application 103 a / 103 b may permit travel bots to exchange messages with the user, but filter or deny messages from shopping bots.
- bots may request that the user permit the bot to access user data, such as location, payment information, contact list, etc.
- user data such as location, payment information, contact list, etc.
- a user is presented with options to permit or deny access to the bot. If the user denies access, the bot may respond via a message, e.g., “Sorry, I am not able to book a taxi for you.” Further, the user may provide access to information on a limited basis, e.g., the user may permit the taxi bot to access a current location only upon specific invocation of the bot, but not otherwise.
- the user can control the type, quantity, and granularity of information that a bot can access, and is provided with the ability (e.g., via a user interface) to change such permissions at any time.
- user data may be processed, e.g., to remove personally identifiable information, to limit information to specific data elements, etc. before a bot can access such data.
- users can control usage of user data by messaging application 103 a / 103 b and one or more bots. For example, a user can specify that a bot that offers capability to make financial transactions require user authorization before a transaction is completed, e.g., the bot may send a message “Tickets for the movie Space and Starts are $12 each. Shall I go ahead and book?” or “The best price for this shirt is $125, including shipping. Shall I charge your credit card ending 1234 ?” etc.
- messaging application 103 a / 103 b may also provide one or more suggestions, e.g., suggested responses, to users 125 via a user interface, e.g., as a button, or other user interface element.
- Suggested responses may enable faster interaction, e.g., by reducing or eliminating the need for a user to type a response.
- Suggested responses may enable users to respond to a message quickly and easily, e.g., when a client device lacks text input functionality (e.g., a smartwatch that does not include a keyboard or microphone).
- Suggested responses may also enable users to respond quickly to messages, e.g., when the user selects suggested response (e.g., by selecting a corresponding a user interface element on a touchscreen).
- Suggested responses may be generated using predictive models, e.g., machine learning models, that are trained to generate responses.
- messaging application 103 a / 103 b may implement machine learning, e.g., a deep learning model, that can enhance user interaction with messaging application 103 .
- Machine-learning models may be trained using synthetic data, e.g., data that is automatically generated by a computer, with no use of user information.
- machine-learning models may be trained, e.g., based on sample data, for which permissions to utilize user data for training have been obtained expressly from users. For example, sample data may include received messages and responses that were sent to the received messages. Based on the sample data, the machine-learning model can predict responses to received messages, which may then be provided as suggested responses.
- User interaction is enhanced, e.g., by reducing burden on the user to compose a response to a received message, by providing a choice of responses that are customized based on the received message and the user's context.
- suggested responses may be customized based on the user's prior activity, e.g., earlier messages in a conversation, messages in different conversations, etc.
- such activity may be used to determine an appropriate suggested response for the user, e.g., a playful response, a formal response, etc. based on the user's interaction style.
- messaging application 103 a / 103 b may generate suggested responses in the user's preferred language.
- suggested responses may be text responses, images, multimedia, etc.
- machine learning may be implemented on messaging server 101 , on client devices 115 , or on both messaging server 101 and client devices 115 .
- a simple machine learning model may be implemented on client device 115 (e.g., to permit operation of the model within memory, storage, and processing constraints of client devices) and a complex machine learning model may be implemented on messaging server 101 . If a user does not provide consent for use of machine learning techniques, such techniques are not implemented. In some implementations, a user may selectively provide consent for machine learning to be implemented only on a client device 115 .
- machine learning may be implemented on client device 115 , such that updates to a machine learning model or user information used by the machine learning model are stored or used locally, and are not shared to other devices such as messaging server 101 , server 135 , or other client devices 115 .
- suggestions may be provided by messaging application 103 .
- suggestions may include suggestions of content (e.g., movies, books, etc.), schedules (e.g., available time on a user's calendar), events/venues (e.g., restaurants, concerts, etc.), and so on.
- suggestions may include suggested responses to incoming messages that are based on conversation content. For example, if a first user of two users that have consented to suggestions based on conversation content, sends a message “do you want to grab a bite?
- a response may be suggested to the second user, e.g. “@assistant lunch, Italian, table for 2”.
- the suggested response includes a bot (identified by the symbol @ and bot handle assistant). If the second user selects this response, the assistant bot is added to the conversation and the message is sent to the bot. A response from the bot may then be displayed in the conversation, and either of the two users may send further messages to the bot.
- the assistant bot is not provided access to the content of the conversation, and suggested responses are generated by the messaging application 103 .
- the content of a suggested response may be customized based on whether a bot is already present in a conversation or is able to be incorporated into the conversation. For example, if it is determined that a travel bot could be incorporated into the messaging app, a suggested response to a question about the cost of plane tickets to France could be “Let's ask travel bot!”
- suggestions may include one or more of: text (e.g., “Terrific!”), emoji (e.g., a smiley face, a sleepy face, etc.), images (e.g., photos from a user's photo library), text generated based on templates with user data inserted in a field of the template (e.g., “her number is ⁇ Phone Number>” where the field “Phone Number” is filled in based on user data, if the user provides access to user data), links (e.g., Uniform Resource Locators), etc.
- suggested responses may be formatted and/or styled, e.g., using colors, fonts, layout, etc.
- a suggested response that includes a movie recommendation may include descriptive text about the movie, an image from the movie, and a link to buy tickets.
- suggested responses may be presented as different types of user interface elements, e.g., text boxes, information cards, etc.
- users are offered control over whether they receive suggestions, what types of suggestions they receive, a frequency of the suggestions, etc. For example, users may decline to receive suggestions altogether, or may choose specific types of suggestions, or to receive suggestions only during certain times of day. In another example, users may choose to receive personalized suggestions.
- machine learning may be used to provide suggestions, based on the user's preferences relating to use of their data and use of machine learning techniques.

Abstract
Permission control and management for messaging application bots is described. A method can include providing a messaging application, on a first computing device associated with a first user, to enable communication between the first user and another user, and detecting, at the messaging application, a user request. The method can also include programmatically determining that an action in response to the user request requires access to data associated with the first user, and causing a permission interface to be rendered in the messaging application, the permission interface enabling the first user to approve or prohibit access to the data associated with the first user. The method can include accessing the data associated with the first user and performing the action in response to the user request, upon receiving user input from the first user indicating approval of the access to the data associated with the first user.
Description
This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/695,967, filed Nov. 26, 2019 and titled BOT PERMISSIONS, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/709,440, filed Sep. 19, 2017 and titled BOT PERMISSIONS (now U.S. Pat. No. 10,511,450), which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/397,047, filed Sep. 20, 2016 and titled BOT PERMISSIONS, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
Users conduct messaging conversations, e.g., chat, instant message, etc. using messaging services. Messaging conversations may be conducted using any user device, e.g., a computer, a mobile device, a wearable device, etc. As users conduct more conversations and perform more tasks using messaging applications, automated assistance with messaging conversations or tasks (e.g., via a bot or other automated assistant application) may be useful to improve efficiency. While automation may help make messaging communications more efficient for users, there may be a need to manage permissions relating to when and how a messaging bot accesses user information and what user information the messaging bot is permitted to access.
The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.
Some implementations can include a computer-implemented method comprising providing a messaging application, on a first computing device associated with a first user, to enable communication between the first user and at least one other user, and detecting, at the messaging application, a user request. The method can also include programmatically determining that an action in response to the user request requires access to data associated with the first user, and causing a permission interface to be rendered in the messaging application on the first computing device, the permission interface enabling the first user to approve or prohibit the access to the data associated with the first user. The method can further include upon receiving user input from the first user indicating approval of the access to the data associated with the first user, accessing the data associated with the first user and performing the action in response to the user request.
The method can also include upon receiving user input from the first user prohibiting the access to the data associated with the first user, providing an indication in the messaging application that the task is not performed. In some implementations the first user can include a human user and the at least one other user can include an assistive agent.
In some implementations, the first user is a human user and the at least one other user includes a second human user, different from the first user, associated with a second computing device. The permission interface can be rendered in the messaging application on the first computing device associated with the first user and the permission interface is not displayed on the second computing device associated with the second human user.
The method can further include, upon receiving user input from the first user prohibiting access of the data associated with the first user, providing a first indication for rendering on the first computing device associated with the first user. The method can also include providing a second indication for rendering on a second computing device associated with the at least one other user, the first and second indications indicating failure to serve the user request, wherein the first and second indications are different.
In some implementations, the first and second indications can include have one or more of: different textual content, different style, and different format. In some implementations, the first user includes a human user and the at least one other user includes a second human user, different from the first user and an assistive agent. The user request can be received from the first computing device associated with the first user. The method can also include initiating, in response to the user request, a separate conversation in the messaging application. The separate conversation can include the first user and the assistive agent, and may not include the second human user.
In some implementations, detecting the user request comprises analyzing one or more messages received in the messaging application from one or more of the first user and the at least one other user. The one or more messages can include one or more of a text message, a multimedia message, and a command to an assistive agent. Performing the action in response to the user request can include providing one or more suggestions to the first messaging application.
The method can also include causing the one or more suggestions to be rendered in the messaging application. The one or more suggestions can be rendered as suggestion elements that, when selected by the first user, cause details about the suggestion to be displayed.
Some implementations can include a computer-implemented method. The method can include detecting, at a messaging application, a user request, and programmatically determining that an action in response to the user request requires access to data associated with the first user. The method can also include causing a permission interface to be rendered in the messaging application on the first computing device, the permission interface enabling the first user to approve or prohibit the access to the data associated with the first user. The method can further include upon receiving approval from the first user at the permission interface, accessing the data associated with the first user and performing the action in response to the user request.
The method can also include, upon receiving user input from the first user prohibiting the access to the data associated with the first user, providing an indication in the messaging application that the task is not performed. The method can further include upon receiving user input from the first user prohibiting access of the data associated with the first user, and providing a first indication for rendering in the messaging application. The method can also include providing a second indication for rendering in a second messaging application associated with at least one other user, the first and second indications indicating failure to serve the user request, wherein the first and second indications are different.
Some implementations can include a system comprising one or more processors coupled to a nontransitory computer readable medium having stored thereon instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform operations. The operations can include providing a messaging application, on a first computing device associated with a first user, to enable communication between the first user and at least one other user, and detecting, at the messaging application, a user request. The operations can also include programmatically determining that an action in response to the user request requires access to data associated with the first user, and causing a permission interface to be rendered in the messaging application on the first computing device, the permission interface enabling the first user to approve or prohibit the access to the data associated with the first user. The operations can further include, upon receiving user input from the first user indicating approval of the access to the data associated with the first user, accessing the data associated with the first user and performing the action in response to the user request.
The operations can also include, upon receiving user input from the first user prohibiting the access to the data associated with the first user, providing an indication in the messaging application that the task is not performed. In some implementations, the first user can include a human user and the at least one other user can include an assistive agent. In some implementations, the first user can include a human user and the at least one other user can include a second human user, different from the first user, associated with a second computing device. The permission interface can be rendered in the messaging application on the first computing device associated with the first user and the permission interface is not displayed on the second computing device associated with the second human user.
One or more implementations described herein relate to permission control and management for messaging application bots.
In the illustrated implementation, messaging server 101, client devices 115, and server 135 are communicatively coupled via a network 140. In various implementations, network 140 may be a conventional type, wired or wireless, and may have numerous different configurations including a star configuration, token ring configuration or other configurations. Furthermore, network 140 may include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN) (e.g., the Internet), and/or other interconnected data paths across which multiple devices may communicate. In some implementations, network 140 may be a peer-to-peer network. Network 140 may also be coupled to or include portions of a telecommunications network for sending data in a variety of different communication protocols. In some implementations, network 140 includes Bluetooth® communication networks, Wi-Fi®, or a cellular communications network for sending and receiving data including via short messaging service (SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), direct data connection, email, etc. Although FIG. 1 illustrates one network 140 coupled to client devices 115, messaging server 101, and server 135, in practice one or more networks 140 may be coupled to these entities.
In various implementations, when respective users associated with client devices 115 provide consent for storage of messages, database 199 may store messages exchanged between one or more client devices 115. In some implementations, when respective users associated with client devices 115 provide consent for storage of messages, database 199 may store messages exchanged between one or more client devices 115 and one or more bots implemented on a different device, e.g., another client device, messaging server 101, and server 135, etc. In the implementations where one or more users do not provide consent, messages received and sent by those users are not stored.
In some implementations, messages may be encrypted, e.g., such that only a sender and recipient of a message can view the encrypted messages. In some implementations, messages are stored. In some implementations, database 199 may further store data and/or configuration of one or more bots, e.g., bot 107 a, bot 111, etc. In some implementations when a user 125 provides consent for storage of user data (such as social network data, contact information, images, etc.) database 199 may also store user data associated with the respective user 125 that provided such consent.
In some implementations, messaging application 103 a/103 b may provide a user interface that enables a user 125 to create new bots. In these implementations, messaging application 103 a/103 b may include functionality that enables user-created bots to be included in conversations between users of messaging application 103 a/103 b.
Client device 115 may be a computing device that includes a memory and a hardware processor, for example, a camera, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a mobile telephone, a wearable device, a mobile email device, a portable game player, a portable music player, a reader device, head mounted display or other electronic device capable of wirelessly accessing network 140.
In the illustrated implementation, client device 115 a is coupled to the network 140 via signal line 108 and client device 115 n is coupled to the network 140 via signal line 110. Signal lines 108 and 110 may be wired connections, e.g., Ethernet, or wireless connections, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other wireless technology. Client devices 115 a, 115 n are accessed by users 125 a, 125 n, respectively. The client devices 115 a, 115 n in FIG. 1 are used by way of example. While FIG. 1 illustrates two client devices, 115 a and 115 n, the disclosure applies to a system architecture having one or more client devices 115.
In some implementations, client device 115 may be a wearable device worn by a user 125. For example, client device 115 may be included as part of a clip (e.g., a wristband), part of jewelry, or part of a pair of glasses. In another example, client device 115 can be a smartwatch. In various implementations, user 125 may view messages from the messaging application 103 a/103 b on a display of the device, may access the messages via a speaker or other output device of the device, etc. For example, user 125 may view the messages on a display of a smartwatch or a smart wristband. In another example, user 125 may access the messages via headphones (not shown) coupled to or part of client device 115, a speaker of client device 115, a haptic feedback element of client device 115, etc.
In some implementations, messaging application 103 b is stored on a client device 115 a. In some implementations, messaging application 103 b (e.g., a thin-client application, a client module, etc.) may be a client application stored on client device 115 a with a corresponding a messaging application 103 a (e.g., a server application, a server module, etc.) that is stored on messaging server 101. For example, messaging application 103 b may transmit messages created by user 125 a on client device 115 a to messaging application 103 a stored on messaging server 101.
In some implementations, messaging application 103 a may be a standalone application stored on messaging server 101. A user 125 a may access the messaging application 103 a via a web page using a browser or other software on client device 115 a. In some implementations, messaging application 103 b that is implemented on the client device 115 a may include the same or similar modules as those included on messaging server 101. In some implementations, messaging application 103 b may be implemented as a standalone client application, e.g., in a peer-to-peer or other configuration where one or more client devices 115 include functionality to enable exchange of messages with other client devices 115. In these implementations, messaging server 101 may include limited or no messaging functionality (e.g., client authentication, backup, etc.). In some implementations, messaging server 101 may implement one or more bots, e.g., bot 107 a and bot 111.
In various implementations, server 135 may be part of the same entity that manages messaging server 101, e.g., a provider of messaging services. In some implementations, server 135 may be a third party server, e.g., controlled by an entity different than the entity that provides messaging application 103 a/103 b. In some implementations, server 135 provides or hosts bots.
A bot is an automated service, implemented on one or more computers, that users interact with primarily through text, e.g., via messaging application 103 a/103 b. A bot may be implemented by a bot provider such that the bot can interact with users of various messaging applications. In some implementations, a provider of messaging application 103 a/103 b may also provide one or more bots. In some implementations, bots provided by the provider of messaging application 103 a/103 b may be configured such that the bots can be included in other messaging applications, e.g., provided by other providers. A bot may provide several advantages over other modes. For example, a bot may permit a user to try a new service (e.g., a taxi booking service, a restaurant reservation service, etc.) without having to install an application on a client device, or accessing a web site. Further, a user may interact with a bot via text, which requires minimal or no learning, compared with that required to use a website, software application, a telephone call, e.g., to an interactive voice response (IVR) service, or other manners of interacting with a service. Incorporating a bot within a messaging service or application may also permit users to collaborate with other users to accomplish various tasks such as travel planning, shopping, scheduling events, obtaining information, etc. within the messaging service, and eliminate cumbersome operations such as switching between various applications (e.g., a taxi booking application, a restaurant reservation application, a calendar application, etc.) or websites to accomplish the tasks.
A bot may be implemented as a computer program or application (e.g., a software application) that is configured to interact with one or more users (e.g., any of the users 125 a-n) via messaging application 103 a/103 b to provide information or to perform specific actions within the messaging application 103. As one example, an information retrieval bot may search for information on the Internet and present the most relevant search result within the messaging app. As another example, a travel bot may have the ability to make travel arrangements via messaging application 103, e.g., by enabling purchase of travel and hotel tickets within the messaging app, making hotel reservations within the messaging app, making rental car reservations within the messaging app, and the like. As another example, a taxi bot may have the ability to call a taxi, e.g., to the user's location (obtained by the taxi bot from client device 115, when a user 125 permits access to location information) without having to invoke or call a separate taxi reservation app. As another example, a coach/tutor bot may tutor a user to instruct the user in some subject matter within a messaging app, e.g., by asking questions that are likely to appear on an examination and providing feedback on whether the user's responses were correct or incorrect. As another example, a game bot may play a game on the opposite side or the same side as a user within a messaging app. As another example, a commercial bot may provide services from a specific merchant, e.g., by retrieving product information from the merchant's catalog and enabling purchase through a messaging app. As another example, an interface bot may interface a remote device or vehicle so that a user of a messaging app can chat with, retrieve information from, and/or provide instructions to the remote device or vehicle.
A bot's capabilities may include understanding a user's intent and executing on it. The user's intent may be understood by analyzing and understanding the user's conversation and its context. A bot may also understand the changing context of a conversation or the changing sentiments and/or intentions of the users based on a conversation evolving over time. For example, if user A suggests meeting for coffee but if user B states that he does not like coffee, then a bot may assign a negative sentiment score for coffee to user B and may not suggest a coffee shop for the meeting.
Implementing bots that can communicate with users of messaging application 103 a/103 b may provide many advantages. Conventionally, a user may utilize a software application or a web site to perform activities such as paying bills, ordering food, booking tickets, etc. A problem with such implementations is that a user is required to install or use multiple software applications, and websites, in order to perform the multiple activities. For example, a user may have to install different software applications to pay a utility bill (e.g., from the utility company), to buy movie tickets (e.g., a ticket reservation application from a ticketing service provider), to make restaurant reservations (e.g., from respective restaurants), or may need to visit a respective website for each activity. Another problem with such implementations is that the user may need to learn a complex user interface, e.g., a user interface implemented using multiple user interface elements, such as windows, buttons, checkboxes, dialog boxes, etc.
Consequently, an advantage of one or more described implementations is that a single application enables a user to perform activities that involve interaction with any number of parties, without being required to access a separate website or install and run software applications, which has a technical effect of reducing consumption of memory, storage, and processing resources on a client device. An advantage of the described implementations is that the conversational interface makes it easier and faster for the user to complete such activities, e.g., without having to learn a complex user interface, which has a technical effect of reducing consumption of computational resources. Another advantage of the described implementations is that implementing bots may enable various participating entities to provide user interaction at a lower cost, which has a technical effect of reducing the need for computational resources that are deployed to enable user interaction, such as a toll-free number implemented using one or more of a communications server, a web site that is hosted on one or more web servers, a customer support email hosted on an email server, etc. Another technical effect of described features is a reduction in the problem of consumption of system processing and transmission resources required for completing user tasks across communication networks.
While certain examples herein describe interaction between a bot and one or more users, various types of interactions, such as one-to-one interaction between a bot and a user 125, one-to-many interactions between a bot and two or more users (e.g., in a group messaging conversation), many-to-one interactions between multiple bots and a user, and many-to-many interactions between multiple bots and multiple users are be possible. Further, in some implementations, a bot may also be configured to interact with another bot (e.g., bots 107 a/107 b, 109 a/109 b, 111, 113, etc.) via messaging application 103, via direct communication between bots, or a combination. For example, a restaurant reservation bot may interact with a bot for a particular restaurant in order to reserve a table.
In certain embodiments, a bot may use a conversational interface to use natural language to interact conversationally with a user. In certain embodiments, a bot may use a template-based format to create sentences with which to interact with a user, e.g., in response to a request for a restaurant address, using a template such as “the location of restaurant R is L.” In certain cases, a user may be enabled to select a bot interaction format, e.g., whether the bot is to use natural language to interact with the user, whether the bot is to use template-based interactions, etc.
In cases in which a bot interacts conversationally using natural language, the content and/or style of the bot's interactions may dynamically vary based on one or more of: the content of the conversation determined using natural language processing, the identities of the users in the conversations, and one or more conversational contexts (e.g., historical information on the user's interactions, connections between the users in the conversation based on a social graph), external conditions (e.g., weather, traffic), the user's schedules, related context associated with the users, and the like. In these cases, the content and style of the bot's interactions is varied based on only such factors for which users participating in the conversation have provided consent.
As one example, if the users of a conversation are determined to be using formal language (e.g., no or minimal slang terms or emojis), then a bot may also interact within that conversation using formal language, and vice versa. As another example, if a user in a conversation is determined (based on the present and/or past conversations) to be a heavy user of emojis, then a bot may also interact with that user using one or more emojis. As another example, if it is determined that two users in a conversation are in remotely connected in a social graph (e.g., having two or more intermediate nodes between them denoting, e.g., that they are friends of friends of friends), then a bot may use more formal language in that conversation. In the cases where users participating in a conversation have not provided consent for the bot to utilize factors such as the users' social graph, schedules, location, or other context associated with the users, the content and style of interaction of the bot may be a default style, e.g., a neutral style, that doesn't require utilization of such factors.
Further, in some implementations, one or more bots may include functionality to engage in a back-and-forth conversation with a user. For example, if the user requests information about movies, e.g., by entering “@moviebot Can you recommend a movie?”, the bot “moviebot” may respond with “Are you in the mood for a comedy?” The user may then respond, e.g., “nope” to which the bot may respond with “OK. The sci-fi movie entitled Space and Stars has got great reviews. Should I book you a ticket?” The user may then indicate “Yeah, I can go after 6 pm. Please check if Steve can join”. Upon user's consent to the bot accessing information about their contacts and upon the friend Steve's consent to receiving messages from the bot, the bot may send a message to user's friend Steve and perform further actions to book movie tickets at a suitable time.
In certain embodiments, a user participating in a conversation may be enabled to invoke a specific bot or a bot performing a specific task, e.g., by typing a bot name or bot handle (e.g., taxi, @taxibot, @movies, etc.), by using a voice command (e.g., “invoke bankbot”, etc.), by activation of a user interface element (e.g., a button or other element labeled with the bot name or handle), etc. Once a bot is invoked, a user 125 may send a message to the bot via messaging application 103 a/103 b in a manner similar to sending messages to other users 125. For example, to order a taxi, a user may type “@taxibot get me a cab”; to make hotel reservations, a user may type “@hotelbot book a table for 4 at a Chinese restaurant near me.”
In certain embodiments, a bot may automatically suggest information or actions within a messaging conversation without being specifically invoked. That is, the users may not need to specifically invoke the bot. In these embodiments, the bot may depend on analysis and understanding of the conversation on a continual basis or at discrete points of time. The analysis of the conversation may be used to understand specific user needs and to identify when assistance should be suggested by a bot. As one example, a bot may search for some information and suggest the answer if it is determined that a user needs information (e.g., based on the user asking a question to another user, based on multiple users indicating they don't have some information). As another example, if it is determined that multiple users have expressed interest in eating Chinese food, a bot may automatically suggest a set of Chinese restaurants in proximity to the users, including optional information such as locations, ratings and links to the websites of the restaurants.
In certain embodiments, rather than automatically invoking a bot or waiting for a user to explicitly invoke a bot, an automatic suggestion may be made to one or more users in a messaging conversation to invoke one or more bots. In these embodiments, the conversation may be analyzed on a continual basis or at discrete points of time, and the analysis of the conversation may be used to understand specific user needs and to identify when a bot should be suggested within the conversation.
In the embodiments in which a bot may automatically suggest information or actions within a messaging conversation without being specifically invoked, such functionality is disabled, e.g., if one or more users participating in the messaging conversation do not provide consent to a bot performing analysis of the users' conversation. Further, such functionality may also be disabled temporarily based on user input. For example, when the users indicate that a conversation is private or sensitive, analysis of conversational context is suspended until users provide input for the bot to be activated. Further, indications that analysis functionality is disabled may be provided to participants in the conversation, e.g., with a user interface element.
In various implementations, a bot may be implemented in a variety of configurations. For example, as shown in FIG. 1 , bot 105 is implemented on client device 115 a. In this example, the bot may be a module in a software application that is local to client device 115 a. For example, if a user has installed a taxi hailing application on client device 115 a, bot functionality may be incorporated as a module in the taxi hailing application. In this example, a user may invoke a taxi bot, e.g., by sending a message “@taxibot get me a cab.” Messaging application 103 b may automatically cause the bot module in the taxi hailing application be launched. In this manner, a bot may be implemented locally on a client device such that the user can engage in conversation with the bot via messaging application 103.
In another example shown in FIG. 1 , bot 107 a is shown implemented on client device 115 a and bot 107 b is shown as implemented on messaging server 101. In this example, the bot may be implemented, e.g., as a client-server computer program, with portions of the bot functionality provided by each of bot 107 a (server module) and bot 107 b (client module). For example, if the bot is a scheduling bot with the handle @calendar, user 115 a may schedule a reminder, by typing “@calendar remind me to pick up laundry in the evening,” which may be handled by bot 107 b (client module). Continuing with this example, if user 115 a tells the bot “check if Jim is free to meet at 4,” bot 107 a (server module) may contact user Jim (or Jim's scheduling bot) to exchange messages, and provide a response to user 115 a.
In another example, bot 109 a (server module) is implemented on server 135 and bot 109 b (client module) is implemented on client devices 115. In this example, the bot functionality is provided by modules implemented on client devices 115 and server 135, which is distinct from messaging server 101. In some implementations, a bot may be implemented as a distributed application, e.g., with modules distributed across multiple client devices and servers (e.g., client devices 115, server 135, messaging server 101, etc.). In some implementations, a bot may be implemented as a server application, e.g., bot 111 that is implemented on messaging server 101 and bot 113 that is implemented on server 135.
Different implementations such as client-only, server-only, client-server, distributed, etc. may provide different advantages. For example, client-only implementations permit bot functionality to be provided locally, e.g., without network access, which may be advantageous in certain contexts, e.g., when a user is outside of network coverage area or in any area with low or limited network bandwidth. Implementations that include one or more servers, such as server-only, client-server, or distributed configurations may permit certain functionality, e.g., financial transactions, ticket reservations, etc. that may not be possible to provide locally on a client device.
While FIG. 1 shows bots as distinct from messaging application 103, in some implementations, one or more bots may be implemented as part of messaging application 103. In the implementations in which bots are implemented as part of messaging application 103, user permission is obtained before implementing bots. For example, where bots are implemented as part of messaging application 103 a/103 b, messaging application 103 a/103 b may provide bots that can perform certain activities, e.g., a translation bot that translates incoming and outgoing messages, a scheduling bot that schedules events on a user's calendar, etc. In this example, translation bot is activated only upon user's specific permission. If the user does not provide consent, bots within messaging application 103 a/103 b are not implemented (e.g., disabled, removed, etc.). If the user provides consent, a bot or messaging application 103 a/103 b may make limited use of messages exchanged between users via messaging application 103 a/103 b to provide specific functionality, e.g., translation, scheduling, etc.
In some implementations, third parties distinct from a provider of messaging application 103 a/103 b and users 125, may provide bots that can communicate with users 125 via messaging application 103 a/103 b for specific purposes. For example, a taxi service provider may provide a taxi bot, a ticketing service may provide a bot that can book event tickets, a bank bot may provide capability to conduct financial transactions, etc.
In implementing bots via messaging application 103, bots are permitted to communicate with users only upon specific user authorization. For example, if a user invokes a bot, the bot can reply, e.g., based on the user's action of invoking the bot. In another example, a user may indicate particular bots or types of bots that may contact the user. For example, a user may permit travel bots to communicate with her, but not provide authorization for shopping bots. In this example, messaging application 103 a/103 b may permit travel bots to exchange messages with the user, but filter or deny messages from shopping bots.
Further, in order to provide some functionality (e.g., ordering a taxi, making a flight reservation, contacting a friend, etc.), bots may request that the user permit the bot to access user data, such as location, payment information, contact list, etc. In such instances, a user is presented with options to permit or deny access to the bot. If the user denies access, the bot may respond via a message, e.g., “Sorry, I am not able to book a taxi for you.” Further, the user may provide access to information on a limited basis, e.g., the user may permit the taxi bot to access a current location only upon specific invocation of the bot, but not otherwise. In different implementations, the user can control the type, quantity, and granularity of information that a bot can access, and is provided with the ability (e.g., via a user interface) to change such permissions at any time. In some implementations, user data may be processed, e.g., to remove personally identifiable information, to limit information to specific data elements, etc. before a bot can access such data. Further, users can control usage of user data by messaging application 103 a/103 b and one or more bots. For example, a user can specify that a bot that offers capability to make financial transactions require user authorization before a transaction is completed, e.g., the bot may send a message “Tickets for the movie Space and Starts are $12 each. Shall I go ahead and book?” or “The best price for this shirt is $125, including shipping. Shall I charge your credit card ending 1234?” etc.
In some implementations, messaging application 103 a/103 b may also provide one or more suggestions, e.g., suggested responses, to users 125 via a user interface, e.g., as a button, or other user interface element. Suggested responses may enable faster interaction, e.g., by reducing or eliminating the need for a user to type a response. Suggested responses may enable users to respond to a message quickly and easily, e.g., when a client device lacks text input functionality (e.g., a smartwatch that does not include a keyboard or microphone). Suggested responses may also enable users to respond quickly to messages, e.g., when the user selects suggested response (e.g., by selecting a corresponding a user interface element on a touchscreen). Suggested responses may be generated using predictive models, e.g., machine learning models, that are trained to generate responses.
For example, messaging application 103 a/103 b may implement machine learning, e.g., a deep learning model, that can enhance user interaction with messaging application 103. Machine-learning models may be trained using synthetic data, e.g., data that is automatically generated by a computer, with no use of user information. In some implementations, machine-learning models may be trained, e.g., based on sample data, for which permissions to utilize user data for training have been obtained expressly from users. For example, sample data may include received messages and responses that were sent to the received messages. Based on the sample data, the machine-learning model can predict responses to received messages, which may then be provided as suggested responses. User interaction is enhanced, e.g., by reducing burden on the user to compose a response to a received message, by providing a choice of responses that are customized based on the received message and the user's context. For example, when users provide consent, suggested responses may be customized based on the user's prior activity, e.g., earlier messages in a conversation, messages in different conversations, etc. For example, such activity may be used to determine an appropriate suggested response for the user, e.g., a playful response, a formal response, etc. based on the user's interaction style. In another example, when the user specifies one or more preferred languages and/or locales, messaging application 103 a/103 b may generate suggested responses in the user's preferred language. In various examples, suggested responses may be text responses, images, multimedia, etc.
In some implementations, machine learning may be implemented on messaging server 101, on client devices 115, or on both messaging server 101 and client devices 115. In some implementations, a simple machine learning model may be implemented on client device 115 (e.g., to permit operation of the model within memory, storage, and processing constraints of client devices) and a complex machine learning model may be implemented on messaging server 101. If a user does not provide consent for use of machine learning techniques, such techniques are not implemented. In some implementations, a user may selectively provide consent for machine learning to be implemented only on a client device 115. In these implementations, machine learning may be implemented on client device 115, such that updates to a machine learning model or user information used by the machine learning model are stored or used locally, and are not shared to other devices such as messaging server 101, server 135, or other client devices 115.
For the users that provide consent to receiving suggestions, e.g., based on machine-learning techniques, suggestions may be provided by messaging application 103. For example, suggestions may include suggestions of content (e.g., movies, books, etc.), schedules (e.g., available time on a user's calendar), events/venues (e.g., restaurants, concerts, etc.), and so on. In some implementations, if users participating in a conversation provide consent to use of conversation data, suggestions may include suggested responses to incoming messages that are based on conversation content. For example, if a first user of two users that have consented to suggestions based on conversation content, sends a message “do you want to grab a bite? How about Italian?” a response may be suggested to the second user, e.g. “@assistant lunch, Italian, table for 2”. In this example, the suggested response includes a bot (identified by the symbol @ and bot handle assistant). If the second user selects this response, the assistant bot is added to the conversation and the message is sent to the bot. A response from the bot may then be displayed in the conversation, and either of the two users may send further messages to the bot. In this example, the assistant bot is not provided access to the content of the conversation, and suggested responses are generated by the messaging application 103.
In certain implementations, the content of a suggested response may be customized based on whether a bot is already present in a conversation or is able to be incorporated into the conversation. For example, if it is determined that a travel bot could be incorporated into the messaging app, a suggested response to a question about the cost of plane tickets to France could be “Let's ask travel bot!”
In different implementations, suggestions, e.g., suggested responses, may include one or more of: text (e.g., “Terrific!”), emoji (e.g., a smiley face, a sleepy face, etc.), images (e.g., photos from a user's photo library), text generated based on templates with user data inserted in a field of the template (e.g., “her number is <Phone Number>” where the field “Phone Number” is filled in based on user data, if the user provides access to user data), links (e.g., Uniform Resource Locators), etc. In some implementations, suggested responses may be formatted and/or styled, e.g., using colors, fonts, layout, etc. For example, a suggested response that includes a movie recommendation may include descriptive text about the movie, an image from the movie, and a link to buy tickets. In different implementations, suggested responses may be presented as different types of user interface elements, e.g., text boxes, information cards, etc.
In different implementations, users are offered control over whether they receive suggestions, what types of suggestions they receive, a frequency of the suggestions, etc. For example, users may decline to receive suggestions altogether, or may choose specific types of suggestions, or to receive suggestions only during certain times of day. In another example, users may choose to receive personalized suggestions. In this example, machine learning may be used to provide suggestions, based on the user's preferences relating to use of their data and use of machine learning techniques.
At 504, a permission user interface element is caused to be displayed to the user associated with the request. An example of a permission request user interface element is shown in FIG. 6 and described below. The permission user interface element may also be presented as an audio prompt or using other user interface and/or output methods. Processing continues to 506. At 506, an indication is received of whether the user grants the bot permission to access or obtain the user data. The indication can be received in the form of a user interface element selection (e.g., touching, tapping, selecting an on screen user interface button, via typing, audio input, gesture input, etc.) that indicates whether the user grants permission or not. For example, the user could select one of “NOT NOW” or “ALLOW” options shown in the permission user interface element of FIG. 6 . Processing continues to 508.
At 508, the bot permission system determines whether permission was granted or not. Determining whether permission was granted can be accomplished by evaluating the indication received in step 506. If permission was granted, processing continues to 510. If permission was not granted, processing continues to 514.
At 510, an indication of user data being shared with the bot optionally can be provided. For example, the indication “Sharing location data” shown in FIG. 7 can be provided as an indication that user data was shared with the bot according to the permission granted by the user. Processing continues to 512. At 512, the bot may perform further processing to complete the task associated with the permissions that were granted. For example, a car service bot can continue to determine which cars may be in a location to provide car service to the user. In another example, a lodging bot can use shared user location to determine nearby accommodations that are vacant and available for rental.
At 514, the bot can cause an indication of declining the task to be displayed to the user. For example, the bot could provide an indication such as “Sorry I didn't get your location—I'm unable to schedule a car” or the like. The indication could be displayed on a graphical user interface and/or provided in the form of an audio cue or other output indication.
The bot can cause to be displayed a permission allow/disallow interface element 606. The permission element 606 can include a description (608) of what type of permission is needed and input elements for not allowing or allowing the bot permission to access (or receive) user data, 610 and 612 respectively.
At 804, a progress indication is optionally displayed by the bot and may be visible in the group conversation to the group or to the individual user making the request. For example, a car service bot may display a message such as “I'm working on it” in the group conversation. Processing continues to 806.
At 806, a permission user interface element is caused to be displayed to the user associated with the request. An example of a permission request user interface element is shown in FIG. 6 and described above. The permission user interface element may also be presented as an audio prompt or using other user interface and/or output methods. Processing continues to 808.
At 808, an indication is received of whether one or more users grant the bot permission to access or obtain respective user data. The indication can be received in the form of a user interface element selection (e.g., touching, tapping, selecting an on screen user interface button, via typing, audio input, gesture input, etc.) that indicates whether the user grants permission or not. For example, the user could select one of “NOT NOW” or “ALLOW” shown in the permission user interface element of FIG. 6 . Processing continues to 810.
At 810, the bot permission system determines whether permission was granted or not. Determining whether permission was granted can be accomplished by evaluating the indication received in step 808. If permission was granted, processing continues to 812. If permission was not granted, processing continues to 816.
At 812, the bot can start a one-to-one chat with the user. The one-to-one chat and the messages exchanged in the one-to-one chat are not visible to the group of users in the group messaging conversation. Processing continues to 814.
At 814, the bot may perform further processing to complete the task associated with the permissions that were granted within the one-to-one user messaging conversation. For example, a car service bot could continue to determine which cars may be in a location to provide car service to the user. In another example, a lodging bot could use shared user location to determine nearby accommodations that are vacant and available for rental.
At 816, the bot can cause a “graceful” indication of declining the task to be displayed to the user within the group messaging conversation. For example, the bot could provide an indication such as “I wasn't able to get your location—I'm unable to schedule a car” or the like. The indication could be displayed on a graphical user interface or provided in the form of an audio cue or other output indication. The graceful aspect of the decline message can include a message that does not explicitly indicate that a user did not grant the bot permission to use the user's data. In different implementations, the indication may include different textual content, e.g., based on the request, or other factors. For example, an indication in response to user prohibiting access to location in the context of ordering a car may include textual content such as “Sorry, unable to get location,” “I'm unable to find cars near you,” “Car service not available,” etc. In some implementations, different indications may be sent to different participants in a group conversation. In some implementations, indications may use different formats, e.g., text box, graphical indication, animated indication, etc. In some implementations, the indications may use different styles, e.g., boldface text, italicized text, fonts, colors, etc.
One or more methods described herein can be run in a standalone program that can be run on any type of computing device, a program run on a web browser, a mobile application (“app”) run on a mobile computing device (e.g., cell phone, smart phone, tablet computer, wearable device (wristwatch, armband, jewelry, headwear, virtual reality goggles or glasses, augmented reality goggles or glasses, etc.), laptop computer, etc.). In one example, a client/server architecture can be used, e.g., a mobile computing device (as a user device) sends user input data to a server device and receives from the server the final output data for output (e.g., for display). In another example, all computations can be performed within the mobile app (and/or other apps) on the mobile computing device. In another example, computations can be split between the mobile computing device and one or more server devices.
In some implementations, computing device 900 includes a processor 902, a memory 904, and input/output (I/O) interface 906. Processor 902 can be one or more processors and/or processing circuits to execute program code and control basic operations of the computing device 900. A “processor” includes any suitable hardware and/or software system, mechanism or component that processes data, signals or other information. A processor may include a system with a general-purpose central processing unit (CPU), multiple processing units, dedicated circuitry for achieving functionality, or other systems. Processing need not be limited to a particular geographic location, or have temporal limitations. For example, a processor may perform its functions in “real-time,” “offline,” in a “batch mode,” etc. Portions of processing may be performed at different times and at different locations, by different (or the same) processing systems. A computer may be any processor in communication with a memory.
Any of software in memory 904 can alternatively be stored on any other suitable storage location or computer-readable medium. In addition, memory 904 (and/or other connected storage device(s)) can store messages, permission settings, user preferences and related data structures, parameters, audio data, user preferences, and/or other instructions and data used in the features described herein in a database 912. Memory 904 and any other type of storage (magnetic disk, optical disk, magnetic tape, or other tangible media) can be considered “storage” or “storage devices.”
The I/O interface 906 can provide functions to enable interfacing the computing device 900 with other systems and devices. Interfaced devices can be included as part of the computing device 900 or can be separate and communicate with the computing device 900. For example, network communication devices, wireless communication devices, storage devices, and input/output devices can communicate via the I/O interface 906. In some implementations, the I/O interface 906 can connect to interface devices such as input devices (keyboard, pointing device, touch screen, microphone, camera, scanner, sensors, etc.) and/or output devices (display device, speaker devices, printer, motor, etc.).
Some examples of interfaced devices that can connect to I/O interface 906 can include a display device 914 that can be used to display content, e.g., images, video, and/or a user interface of an output application as described herein. Display device 914 can be connected to computing device 900 via local connections (e.g., display bus) and/or via networked connections and can be any suitable display device. The display device 914 can include any suitable display device such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), light emitting diode (LED), or plasma display screen, cathode ray tube (CRT), television, monitor, touch screen, 3-D display screen, or other visual display device. For example display device 914 can be a flat display screen provided on a mobile device, multiple display screens provided in a goggles device, or a monitor screen for a computer device.
The I/O interface 906 can interface to other input and output devices. Some examples include one or more cameras, which can capture image frames. Orientation sensors, e.g., gyroscopes and/or accelerometers, can provide sensor data indicating device orientation (which can correspond to view orientation in some implementations) and/or camera orientation. Some implementations can provide a microphone for capturing sound (e.g., voice commands, etc.), audio speaker devices for outputting sound, or other input and output devices.
For ease of illustration, FIG. 9 shows one block for the processor 902, the memory 904, the I/O interface 906, the operating system 908, and the bot permissions application 910, respectively. These blocks may represent one or more processors or processing circuitries, operating systems, memories, I/O interfaces, applications, and/or software modules. In other implementations, computing device 900 may not have all of the components shown and/or may have other elements including other types of elements instead of, or in addition to, those shown herein. While user devices (e.g., 115 a-115 n) are described as performing blocks and operations as described in some implementations herein, any suitable component or combination of components of user devices (e.g., 115 a-115 n) or similar devices, or any suitable processor or processors associated with such a system, may perform the blocks and operations described.
Methods described herein can be implemented by computer program instructions or code, which can be executed on a computer. For example, the code can be implemented by one or more digital processors (e.g., microprocessors or other processing circuitry) and can be stored on a computer program product including a non-transitory computer readable medium (e.g., storage medium), such as a magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, or semiconductor storage medium, including semiconductor or solid state memory, magnetic tape, a removable computer diskette, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), flash memory, a rigid magnetic disk, an optical disk, a solid-state memory drive, etc. The program instructions can also be contained in, and provided as, an electronic signal, for example in the form of software as a service (SaaS) delivered from a server (e.g., a distributed system and/or a cloud computing system). Alternatively, one or more methods can be implemented in hardware (logic gates, etc.), or in a combination of hardware and software. Example hardware can be programmable processors (e.g. Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD), etc.), general purpose processors, graphics processors, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), and the like. One or more methods can be performed as part of or component of an application running on the system, or as an application or software running in conjunction with other applications and operating system.
Although the description has been described with respect to particular implementations thereof, these particular implementations are merely illustrative, and not restrictive. Concepts illustrated in the examples may be applied to other examples and implementations.
In situations in which certain implementations discussed herein may collect or use personal information about users (e.g., user's phone number or partial phone number, user data, information about a user's social network, user's location and time, user's biometric information, user's activities and demographic information), users are provided with one or more opportunities to control whether the personal information is collected, whether the personal information is stored, whether the personal information is used, and how the information is collected about the user, stored and used. That is, the systems and methods discussed herein collect, store and/or use user personal information specifically upon receiving explicit authorization from the relevant users to do so. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used so that personally identifiable information is removed. As one example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined. As another example, a user's geographic location may be generalized to a larger region so that the user's particular location cannot be determined.
Note that the functional blocks, operations, features, methods, devices, and systems described in the present disclosure may be integrated or divided into different combinations of systems, devices, and functional blocks as would be known to those skilled in the art. Any suitable programming language and programming techniques may be used to implement the routines of particular implementations. Different programming techniques may be employed such as procedural or object-oriented. The routines may execute on a single processing device or multiple processors. Although the steps, operations, or computations may be presented in a specific order, the order may be changed in different particular implementations. In some implementations, multiple steps or operations shown as sequential in this specification may be performed at the same time. Further implementations are disclosed below.
