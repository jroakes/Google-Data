- a user device can request access to a web page via a computer network.
- a web page server e.g., a content publisher
- the content may include the subject of the web page (e.g., a news article) as well as additional content from a third party, such as an advertisement.
- the content may include an advertisement tag that causes the user device to retrieve an advertisement via the network from a data processing system such as an ad placement system.
- the ad placement system can select the appropriate advertisement and provide it to the user device for display with the web page.
- Web page content varies, and not all web sites or web pages are eligible for ad placement.
- web pages may contain objectionable content not suitable for displaying with some advertisements.
- content providers such as advertisers may not want their advertisements to be placed on that web page because some advertisers may not want their advertisements to appear next to a web page article having violent content.
- the ad placement system may identify content on some web pages as being potentially offensive to some people in the absence of an explicit determination that the content is offensive. In such a case, the ad placement system may choose not to show ads on those web pages.
- the ad placement system may provide a link to one or more advertisements, and provide the link as an alternative to the advertisement for display with the web page. For example, an ad placement system may determine that the web page may contain explicit content, and may determine to provide a link that indicates a keyword instead of an advertisement on that page for display at a particular user device.
- the systems and methods described herein can provide links showing keywords related to the initial advertisement query (e.g., the content of the web page) in an ad slot of a web page having objectionable content.
- keywords related to the initial advertisement query e.g., the content of the web page
- users click on those keywords they can be directed to a different web page in which advertisements may be shown.
- an advertiser may object its advertisement appearing on the web page having content objectionable to the advertiser, but may not object if the advertisement is shown on a different web page linked from the page with the objectionable content.
- the data processing system can determine that an ad slot of a content web page is suitable for display of a link having a generic keyword in lieu of an advertisement.
- the keyword may be related to the content of the advertisement, but does not directly identify the advertiser.
- the ad placement system when the ad placement system receives a request for advertisements from a web browser that visits a web page about alcohol, the ad placement system can determine that the alcohol related web page is a site ineligible for advertisements, or for a particular subset of advertisements. In this example, the system can also determine terms or keywords related to the initial advertisement query. Rather than returning alcohol related advertisements for display, the ad placement system can return keywords (e.g., “vodka” or “cocktails”) formatted for display on the alcohol related web page as clickable links. Those links, when clicked, can direct a user to a different web page in which advertisements may be shown. In this example, a vodka (or other) content provider indirectly advertises on the alcohol related web page.
- keywords e.g., “vodka” or “cocktails”

- the content evaluation circuit 140 may extract terms or keywords from the content of the web page and compares them with a list of predetermined keywords stored in the database 130 .
- the list of predetermined keywords can be a list of terms determined by the content provider 115 (e.g., advertisers) or the ad placement system as being associated with ineligible content for ad placement.
- the terms associated with drugs, violence, or illegal or immoral or restricted behavior such as “guns,” “cocaine,” “vodka” may automatically trigger the content evaluation circuit 140 to determine the web page is ineligible for certain advertisements, for example, advertisements about toys, or other content geared toward children.
- the content evaluation circuit 140 may assign a rating score to the web page, based on the content of the web page. This rating score can be compared with a threshold score to determine whether the web page is eligible for advertisements.
- a threshold score there can be a list of threshold scores and each advertisement stored in the ad repository (e.g., the database 130 ) can be assigned with a threshold score.
- the advertisement may not be displayed on that web page.
- a web page may not be eligible for any advertisements. For example, when certain keywords appear on a web page with a high frequency or when the rating score of the web page is above any threshold in the list of threshold scores, the content evaluation circuit 140 can determine the web page is ineligible for any advertisements.
- the data processing system 110 determines a keyword based at least in part on the content of the web page.
- the content evaluation circuit 140 can determine one or more keywords based on the content of the web page.
- the content of the web page can be determined from the title of an article or message displayed on the web page. For example, a web page may have an article entitled “the best time to visit the New York city.” From this title, the content evaluation circuit 140 can determine that the web page has content related to traveling, weather, or the city of New York. From this information, the content evaluation circuit 140 may determine suitable keywords such as “cheapest air ticket” or “New York Restaurant”. When there are multiple suitable keywords available, the content evaluation circuit 140 may choose a keyword determined to be more searchable or monetizable based on historical data.
- the keyword may be a term that has been appeared more frequently in search queries of a search engine.
- a monetizable keyword may be a term associated more frequently with an advertisement having a higher conversion rate (when an advertisement is clicked on, some further desired action occurs on the resulting website, for instance, a purchase is made or contact information is provided, etc.), for example.
- the web page may have a news article with the title “two people killed on the main street by local gang.”
- the content evaluation circuit 140 may determine this is a web page ineligible for ad placement because the web page may contain information about violence.
- the content evaluation circuit 140 can determine relevant keywords, such as “violence prevention” and “pepper spray,” based on the web page content.
- the data processing system 110 can determine that the web page is ineligible for ad placement and that an advertiser may not object if its advertisement is shown on a different web page linked to the web page having the article about violence.
- an advertiser selling pepper spray may not want an advertisement shown on the web page having violent content, but may want a generic link displayed on that web page that when clicked on, displays a second web page that has the advertisement.
- the keyword displayed on the web page can be a generic keyword that does not identify the advertiser, such as the keyword “violence prevention” or “pepper spray”.
- the content evaluation circuit 140 may determine related keywords by examining the terms or a group of terms appeared on the web page. For example, a web page devoted to forum discussion may have the terms such as “houses,” “mortgages,” “bankruptcy,” “foreclosure” appearing frequently on the web page. From this information, the content evaluation circuit 140 may determine relevant keywords such as “best mortgage” or “lowest interest rate” that can be provided as links to a second web page. In this example, an advertiser (e.g., a bank) may not accept its advertisement displaying next to discussions about foreclosure or bankruptcy, but may accept the advertisement to appear on a second web page linked from the keywords such as “best mortgage” or “lowest interest rate”.
- an advertiser e.g., a bank
- the nature or characteristics of some web pages may be stored in the database 130 .
- the database 130 may store historical data indicating that a certain uniform resource locator (“URL”) is a web page about dating.
- the content evaluation circuit 140 may retrieve the historical data from the database 130 and determine that this web page may relate to dating. From this information, the content evaluation circuit 140 can determine a set of relevant keywords, such as “flowers,” “chocolates,” “engagement rings” that can be provided as links to a second web page in which advertisements may be shown.
- the data processing system 110 can identify an advertisement based on the keyword determined from the web page.
- the content placement circuit 135 can identify an advertisement based on the keyword determined by the content evaluation circuit 140 .
- each advertisement stored in the ad repository e.g., one of the databases 130
- An advertising campaign may comprise a series of advertisements that share a single idea and theme which make up an integrated marketing initiative.
- the data processing system 110 can format the keyword for display with the web page as a link to a second web page.
- the content placement circuit 135 can format the keyword identified by the content evaluation circuit 140 to generate a hyperlink to a second web page.
- a hyperlink or link can be a word, group of words, or image that a user can click on to access a new web page.
- the content placement circuit 135 can format the keyword as a link using the HTML ⁇ a> tag and href attribute.
- the keyword is “violence prevention” and the URL of the second web page is http://www.example.com
- the keyword e.g., “violence prevention”
- the URL e.g., http://www.example.com
- the advertisement identified based on the keyword may be stored in the database 130 as a historical data record.
- the data processing system 110 can format a keyword based on content of the advertisement (e.g., keywords associated with an advertisement) as a link to a second web page. For example, if the keyword identified based on the content of the web page is “vodka”, and a keyword associated with an advertisement identified based on the keyword “vodka” can be “liquor”. The data processing system 110 in this example may use the keyword “liquor” as the keyword to format a link to a second web page.
