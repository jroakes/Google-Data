Abstract
A system, computer-readable storage medium storing at least one program, and a computer-implemented method for confirming authorship of documents is presented. A document hosted on a website of a domain is accessed, where the document includes an authorship identifier asserting authorship of the document by an entity. Authorship of the document by the entity is conditionally confirmed when a profile for the entity is associated with the authorship identifier and when the profile for the entity indicates that the entity has confirmed that the authorship identifier is included in documents authored by the entity that are hosted on the first website of the first domain. Responsive to confirming authorship of the document by the entity, application of a confirmed authorship process to the document is permitted. Responsive to failing to confirm authorship of the document by the entity, application of the confirmed authorship process to the document is barred.
Description
This patent application is a continuation of, and claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 13/608,758, filed Sep. 10, 2012, now U.S. Pat. No. 9,177,074, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/532,511, filed Sep. 8, 2011, and titled, “SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONFIRMING AUTHORSHIP OF DOCUMENTS,” both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
The disclosed embodiments relate generally to confirming authorship of documents.
Content on websites often include authorship information. For example, an article may include a byline listing entities that authored the article. However, the authorship information may not be accurate or may not be valid. For example, an article may include authorship information asserting that a particular entity authored the article when in fact the article was not authored by the particular entity. Inaccuracies and/or invalidity of authorship information cause inaccuracies when obtaining search results and/or confusion to users when the search results are presented. Thus, it would be desirable to confirm authorship of content in website so that the entities that authored the content are properly identified.
The embodiments disclosed herein are illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings. Like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts throughout the drawings.
The description that follows includes example systems, methods, techniques, instruction sequences, and computing machine program products that embody illustrative embodiments. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of the described embodiments. It will be evident, however, to those skilled in the art that some embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In general, well-known instruction instances, protocols, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail.
It will also be understood that, although the terms “first,” “second,” etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first contact could be termed a second contact, and, similarly, a second contact could be termed a first contact, which changing the meaning of the description, so long as all occurrences of the “first contact” are renamed consistently and all occurrences of the second contact are renamed consistently. The first contact and the second contact are both contacts, but they are not the same contact.
The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the claims. As used in the description of the embodiments and the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will also be understood that the term “and/or” as used herein refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. It will be further understood that the terms “comprises” and/or “comprising,” when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.
As used herein, the term “if” may be construed to mean “when” or “upon” or “in response to determining” or “in accordance with a determination” or “in response to detecting,” that a stated condition precedent is true, depending on the context. Similarly, the phrase “if it is determined (that a stated condition precedent is true)” or “if (a stated condition precedent is true)” or “when (a stated condition precedent is true)” may be construed to mean “upon determining” or “in response to determining” or “in accordance with a determination” or “upon detecting” or “in response to detecting” that the stated condition precedent is true, depending on the context.
The embodiments described herein provide techniques for confirming authorship of documents.
Server system 102 (sometimes herein called server 102 for ease of reference, noting that some embodiments of server system 102 include multiple servers) is configured to confirm authorship of documents hosted on content server systems (sometimes herein called content servers for ease of reference) 104, 106, and 108, as described in more detail below with reference to FIGS. 2-8 . In some embodiments, server 102 includes a search engine.
In some embodiments, content servers 104, 106, and 108 include web servers that host documents 110, 112, and 114 for websites that are accessible via network 120. The websites include, but are not limited to, news websites, blogs, social networking websites, academic websites, and corporate websites. At least a subset of the documents 110, 112, and 114 include content where each piece of content is authored by respective entities. An entity is defined to be a person, a group of people, or an organization. The content includes, but is not limited to, articles, blog entries, books, music, videos, literature, posts on online discussion forums, posts on social networking websites, and the like.
Note that although FIG. 1 shows a single server (e.g., the server 102) and three content servers (e.g., the content servers 104, 106, and 108), any number of servers and content servers may be present in network system 100. For example, each of server 102, content server 104, content server 106, and content server 108 may include a plurality of distributed servers. The plurality of distributed servers may provide load balancing and/or may provide low-latency points of access to other computer systems. The distributed servers may be located within a single location (e.g., a data center, a building, etc.) or may be geographically distributed across multiple locations (e.g., data centers at various geographical locations, etc.).
Also note that although the embodiments described herein refer to server 102, content server 104, content server 106, and content server 108, the embodiments may be applied to multiple servers and content servers. Furthermore, the functionality of any of server 102, content server 104, content server 106, and content server 108 may be implemented within a single server (or a set of distributed servers). For example, server 102 and content server 104 may be located on the same server (or the same set of distributed servers).
In some embodiments, predefined authorship attributes included in links are used to confirm authorship of documents. FIG. 2 is a block diagram 200 illustrating authorship attributes that are usable to confirm authorship of documents, according to some embodiments. As illustrated in FIG. 2 , a document 204 includes a link 206 and a document 214 includes a link 216. Documents 204 and 214 may be any of the documents from the documents 110, 112, and 114 hosted on the content servers 104, 106, and 108, respectively.
In some embodiments, document 214 is included in website 202 (i.e., the same website that includes document 204). In some embodiments, document 214 is included in a website that is separate and distinct from website 202. In some embodiments, document 214 is a profile page for the entity that document 214 asserts (e.g., via a byline or the like) is an author or contributor to document 214.
In some embodiments, link 206 includes a target attribute 208 and an authorship attribute 210. The target attribute 208 includes information identifying a target document to which link 206 refers, or information specifying a location at which a target document can be accessed. As illustrated in FIG. 2 , the target document referred to by the target attribute 208 is document 214. In some implementations, the target attribute 208 includes a universal resource locator (URL). In some implementations, the target attribute 208 includes a universal resource identifier (URI). The authorship attribute 210 asserts authorship of document 204 by an entity associated with the target document to which link 206 refers. As illustrated in FIG. 2 , the authorship attribute 210 of link 206 asserts that the entity associated with document 214 is an author of document 204. In some implementations, the authorship attribute 210 is rel=“me”. In some implementations, the authorship attribute 210 is rel=“author”. In some implementations, the authorship attribute 210 is represented by a URL parameter in the target URL (target attribute 208), such as a rel=“author” parameter in the URL (e.g., http://www.example.com/article.php?article_id=1001&rel=“author”), instead of as a link parameter that is separate from the target attribute 208.
In some embodiments, link 216 includes a target attribute 218 and an authorship attribute 220. The target attribute 218 includes information identifying a target document to which link 216 refers, or information specifying a location at which a target document can be accessed. As illustrated in FIG. 2 , the target document referred to by the target attribute 218 is the website 202. For example, the target attribute 218 may refer to a root document of a domain (e.g., www.example.com), root document of a subdomain (e.g., me.example.com), a root of a subdirectory within a domain or subdomain (e.g., www.example.com/me/), and root of a set of dynamically-generated web pages in a domain or subdomain (e.g., www.example.com/profile?user_id=1001). In some implementations, the target attribute 218 includes a universal resource locator (URL). In some implementations, the target attribute 218 includes a universal resource identifier (URI). The authorship attribute 220 indicates that the entity associated with document 214 is an author of or contributor to content at the website 202 to which the target attribute 218 refers. As illustrated in FIG. 2 , the authorship attribute 220 of link 216 indicates that the entity associated with document 214 is an author of or contributor to content at website 202. In some implementations, the authorship attribute 220 is rel=“contributor-to”. In some circumstances, the authorship attribute 220 is rel=“me”, which may be used to indicate that the entire website 202 contains content by the entity associated with document 214.
The following discussion provides is an example of how an entity may use the authorship attribute 210 and the authorship attribute 220 to confirm authorship of a document. Assume that document 214 is a profile page for the entity that authored document 204 and that the entity that authored document 204 desires to provide confirmation that the entity did in fact author document 204. In order to do so, the entity that authored document 204 (1) includes link 216 in document (profile page) 214 and (2) includes link 206 in document 204. Assuming that document 214 has the URL “http://www.example.com/profiles/johndoe”, link 206 is <a href=“http://www.example.com/profiles/johndoe” rel=“author”>View my profile </a>, where rel=“author” is the authorship attribute 210. Assuming that a root of the website that hosts document 204 has the URL “http://www.example2.com/articles/”, link 216 is <a href=“http://www.example2.com/articles” rel=“contributor-to”> Read my articles at example2.com </a>, where rel=“contributor-to” is the authorship attribute 220. The loop formed by link 206 and link 216 confirms that the document is authored by the entity associated with document 214.
Note that although FIG. 2 shows only one link for each of the documents, each of the documents may include multiple links in which at least one of the links includes the authorship attribute 210 and/or the authorship attribute 220.
The confirmation techniques discussed with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3 analyze attributes included in links to confirm authorship of documents. The confirmation techniques discussed below with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5 use authorship identifiers to confirm authorship of documents.
In some embodiments, when the authorship identifier 506 is an email address in a domain that hosts a website including documents authored by entity 504, server 102 sends a confirmation email that includes a confirmation link (and/or a confirmation code) to the email address. When entity 504 clicks on the confirmation link (and/or enters the confirmation code on a predetermined webpage), entity 504 confirms that the email address is included in documents authored by entity 504 that are hosted on the website of the domain. When documents hosted on the website of the domain include the email address, entity 504 is confirmed to be author of the documents.
In some embodiments, after the email address has been confirmed, entity 504 provides a byline that is included in documents authored by entity 504 that are hosted on the website of the domain. In these embodiments, when documents hosted on the website of the domain include the byline, entity 504 is confirmed to be author of the documents.
In some embodiments, the profile 502 for entity 504 includes content 510 associated with entity 504. For example, profile 502 may include information relating to articles (e.g., links to the articles, titles of the articles, summaries of the articles) that entity 504 has authored. In some embodiments, profile 502 is a profile on a social networking website.
In some embodiments, the authorship of a document is confirmed using both the authorship identifier and the authorship attributes included in links.

Confirming Authorship of Documents
The authorship confirmation module 618 conditionally confirms authorship of the first document by the entity when a profile for the entity (e.g., the profile 502 for the entity 504) is associated with the authorship identifier and when the profile for the entity indicates that the entity has confirmed that the authorship identifier is included in documents authored by the entity that are hosted on the first website of the first domain. For example, if the profile 502 for the entity 504 is associated with the authorship identifier 404 (e.g., the authorship identifier 506 corresponds to the authorship identifier 404) and the confirmation status 508 indicates that the entity 504 has confirmed that the authorship identifier 506 is included in documents authored by the entity 504 that are hosted on the website 202, the authorship confirmation module 618 confirms that the entity associated with the authorship identifier 404 (e.g., the entity 504) authored the document 402. In some embodiments, the authorship identifier in the profile is publicly viewable.
In some embodiments, the authorship confirmation module 618 determines that the first document has a non-confirmed authorship when no profile for the entity associated with the authorship identifier can be found or when the profile for the entity does not indicate that the entity has confirmed that the authorship identifier is included in documents authored by the entity.
In some embodiments, the authorship identifier includes an email address for a purported author of or contributor to the first document, where the email address is an email address in the first domain. In these embodiments, prior to conditionally confirming the authorship of the first document, the authorship confirmation module 618 requests that the entity confirm that the email address associated with the profile for the entity is the email address that the entity includes in documents authored by the entity. For example, the authorship confirmation module 618 may send a confirmation email that includes a confirmation link (and/or a confirmation code) to the email address. When the entity clicks on the confirmation link (and/or enters the confirmation code on a predetermined webpage), the entity confirms that the email address is included in documents authored by the entity that are hosted on the first website of the first domain. In some implementations, these embodiments require that the email address is an email address in the domain in which the first document is hosted. For example, if the first document is hosted on www.example.com, the email address must be in the example.com domain (e.g., johndoe@example.com). In some implementations, these embodiments require that the email address is included in a document in an unambiguous way and the entity has confirmed the email address associated with the profile of the entity (as described above). In one example, the first document includes an email address johndoe@example.com within a predetermined distance from a byline for the first document and the profile for the entity is associated with the confirmed email address johndoe@example.com. Alternatively, the first document includes an email link targeting an email address johndoe@example.com that also includes an authorship attribute rel=“author” and the profile for entity is associated with the confirmed email address johndoe@example.com.
In some embodiments, the authorship identifier includes a byline for a purported author of or contributor to the first document as the byline appears in documents hosted at least one domain. In these embodiments, prior to conditionally confirming the authorship of the first document, the authorship confirmation module 618 requests that the entity confirm that the byline associated with the profile for the entity is the byline that the entity includes in documents authored by the entity. In one example, the authorship confirmation module 618 requests that the entity provide a byline that is included in documents that are hosted on the first website of the first domain and that are authored by the entity. In some implementations, the entity provides a byline by providing a name of the entity (e.g., “John Doe”). In these implementations, the confirmation module 618 identifies occurrences of the name (or close matches) within documents that indicate that the named entity is an author of the document. In some implementations, the authorship confirmation module 618 first requests that the entity confirm that an email address associated with the profile for the entity is the email address that the entity includes in documents in the first website of the first domain that are authored by the entity, as discussed above. The confirmation of the email address confirms that the entity is an author of or contributor to documents hosted on the first website of the first domain, and therefore, a byline provided by the entity can be trusted to be a byline that the entity includes in documents that are hosted on the first website of the first domain and that are authored by the entity.
In some embodiments, the authorship identifier includes an email link to an email address for a purported author of or contributor to the first document, where the email link includes a predefined authorship attribute (e.g., the authorship attribute 220). For example, the email link may be <a href=“mailto:johndoe@example.com” rel=“author”>Email me</a>. In these embodiments, prior to conditionally confirming the authorship of the first document, the authorship confirmation module 618 requests that the entity confirm that the email address associated with the profile for the entity is the email address that the entity includes in documents authored by the entity, as discussed above.
After confirming the authorship of the document, several operations may be performed. In some embodiments, responsive to confirming authorship of the first document by the entity, the authorship confirmation module 618 adds the first document (e.g., document 402) to the profile for the entity (e.g., the profile 502 for the entity 504).
In some embodiments, responsive to confirming authorship of the first document by the entity, the authorship confirmation module 618 adds the first document (e.g., the document 402) to a social networking webpage for the entity.
In some embodiments, responsive to confirming authorship of the first document by the entity, the authorship confirmation module 618 adds information relating to the first document (e.g., document 402) to a webpage including information relating to documents that the entity authored. In some implementations, the webpage including information relating to documents that the entity authored is an author webpage on the first website, an author webpage on a social networking website, a blog for the author, or a search result web page.
In some embodiments, responsive to confirming authorship of the first document by the entity, the authorship confirmation module 618 associates the first document (e.g., the document 402) with the entity (e.g., the entity 504) in a search index (e.g., the search index 620).
In some embodiments, the methods illustrated in FIG. 8 are governed by instructions that are stored in a computer readable storage medium and that are executed by at least one processor of at least one server. Each of the operations shown in FIG. 8 corresponds to instructions stored in a non-transitory computer memory or computer readable storage medium. In various implementations, the non-transitory computer readable storage medium includes a magnetic or optical disk storage device, solid state storage devices such as Flash memory, or other non-volatile memory device or devices. The computer readable instructions stored on the non-transitory computer readable storage medium may be in source code, assembly language code, object code, or other instruction format that is interpreted and/or executable by one or more processors.
Plural instances may be provided for components, operations or structures described herein as a single instance. Finally, boundaries between various components, operations, and data stores are somewhat arbitrary, and particular operations are illustrated in the context of specific illustrative configurations. Other allocations of functionality are envisioned and may fall within the scope of the embodiment(s). In general, structures and functionality presented as separate components in the example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly, structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations, modifications, additions, and improvements fall within the scope of the embodiment(s).
The foregoing description, for purpose of explanation, has been described with reference to specific embodiments. However, the illustrative discussions above are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the embodiments to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles and their practical applications, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the embodiments and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.
