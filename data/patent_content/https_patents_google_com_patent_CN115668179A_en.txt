This description relates to data processing and, in particular, to the selection and provision of one or more digital components provided during the display of content.
The internet provides access to digital content, such as video clips, audio clips, or multimedia clips, provided by a content distribution system (e.g., a search platform, social media platform, or other platform hosting digital content). Users may view such digital content using applications (e.g., web browsers, native applications) executing on client devices such as smart phones, tablet computers, and personal computers.
The content distribution system may also provide digital components (e.g., digital content that is not part of or originally not included in the digital content) for presentation on the client device during presentation of the digital content. For example, digital content (e.g., a video clip) may temporarily pause one or more time intervals during its presentation, and during each of these time intervals (referred to as a time slot), one or more digital components provided by the digital component system may be presented on the client device. Presentation of the digital content may be resumed after the digital component has been fully presented or after the duration of the time slot has elapsed.

Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages. As described above, the content distribution system selects and communicates digital components to the client device. In general, the digital components provided to the client device may vary in their respective durations. Some prior art techniques for selecting and providing digital components seek to maximize the total number of digital components that are selected and provided to the client device for display within a time slot (as described further below), which typically results in a bias towards selecting and providing digital components having a shorter duration (relative to other digital components), resulting in disproportionate selection and delivery of digital components. For example, when the digital components are provided for a 45 second time slot, three 15 second digital components may be selected and provided instead of one 45 second digital component or one 30 second digital component and one 15 second digital component. Other prior art techniques for selecting and providing digital components for time slots having longer durations tend to support digital components having longer durations. Thus, such prior art techniques disproportionately tend to select digital components of shorter or longer duration relative to other digital components. In contrast, the techniques and methods described in this document allow for equal/proportional selection of digital components of different durations.
The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

Detailed Description
Client devices connected to the internet (e.g., smartphones, tablets, and personal computers) may provide content by a content distribution system (e.g., a search platform, a social media platform, or another platform hosting digital content). This content may include time slots that pause or otherwise abort the presentation/display/streaming of the content for a period of time so that digital components that were not otherwise included in the content may be presented to a user of the client device. As used throughout this document, the phrase "digital component" refers to a discrete unit of digital content or digital information (e.g., a video clip, audio clip, multimedia clip, image, text, or other unit of content). Typically, the digital component is separate from the content and is selected for presentation based on the context in which the content is played (e.g., date, time, user characteristics, and device characteristics). For example, the digital component may be selected and provided by a system different from the system providing the digital content (e.g., a digital component system). Further, the digital component is typically created by an entity other than the entity that created the content and, therefore, is considered third party content with respect to the content.
To facilitate presentation of the digital component during presentation of the digital content, the content includes (or references) a series of time slots that have been generated for the content. The time slots specify time stamps within the content duration in which the rendering of the content may be aborted and the digital components may be provided. For example, assume that a user is watching a particular video provided as a streaming service by a content distribution system using a client device. Assume also that the duration of a particular video being presented on a client device is ten minutes and that the particular video includes a time slot of 5 minutes from the beginning of the particular video. In such implementations, an application presenting a particular video may determine that the time slot is located at a five minute presentation point within the video. Based on this determination, the application can pause (or otherwise abort) presentation of the particular video when playback reaches the five-point Zhong Biao record, and present the digital component provided by the digital component system when playback of the particular video is aborted. After the digital component presentation (or at the end of the time slot duration), the application resumes presentation of the particular video. The time slot may also specify constraints including a maximum number of digital components that may be provided within the time slot and/or a maximum total duration that specifies a total time allocated to the digital components provided within the time slot. For example, if a slot specifies that a maximum of three digital components can be provided within the slot, the slot may display no more than three digital components in succession. In another example, if a slot specifies a maximum total duration of 45 seconds for a slot, any number of digital components may be selected to be displayed within the slot until and unless the sum of the durations of all selected digital components is less than or equal to 45 seconds. As another example, if a slot specifies a constraint that, for example, a maximum of three digital components can be provided within the slot and specifies that the maximum total duration of the slot is 45 seconds, the slot may continuously display no more than three digital components and up to three digital components may be selected such that the sum of the durations of the three digital components is less than or equal to 45 seconds.
Depending on the particular implementation, there may be one or more time slots for displaying the digital component. In one example implementation, a slot may accommodate a single digital component, while in other implementations, a slot may accommodate more than one digital component.
The digital components may have different durations. As noted above, prior art techniques of selecting digital components for delivery to client devices typically maximize the total number of digital components that can be presented on a client device during a time slot, which results in disproportionately selecting digital components of shorter duration (relative to other digital components of longer duration). Other prior art attempts to select longer duration digital components without attempting and maximizing the total number of digital components result in disproportionately selecting longer duration digital components. Either way, existing selection strategies result in a bias towards selecting digital components having a particular duration. In contrast, the techniques and methods described in this document enable equal/proportional selection of digital components with different durations for display within a time slot included in particular content. The techniques described herein achieve this by selecting the digital component based not only on the duration of the digital component, but also on other attributes related to the constraints imposed by the digital component and the constraints imposed by the time slot in which the digital component is to be provided. In some implementations, and as described in more detail in this document, the techniques described in this document generate a score for each digital component in a set of digital components based on various factors related to the time slot, such as (1) a maximum number of digital components that can be provided in the time slot and (2) a total duration of the time slot, and factors related to the digital components, such as (1) a duration of the digital components, (2) a location requirement for the digital components that specifies whether the digital components need to be provided in a particular location among available locations of the time slot, (3) a number of times the digital components can be provided within the time slot, (4) a type of the digital components (e.g., video digital components or audio digital components), and (5) a priority of the digital components that indicates an importance of presenting the digital components on the client device. The resulting score for each digital component represents the likelihood of a proportional and fair distribution of the digital components within the time slot whether the provision of the digital components remains for different durations. For example, a higher score for a digital component indicates that the distribution of the digital component is more likely to produce a proportional/fair distribution of the digital component, while a lower score for a digital component indicates that the distribution of the digital component is less likely to produce a proportional or fair distribution of the digital component.
Based on the scores generated for the digital components in the set of digital components, one or more digital components (e.g., the digital component with the highest score) are selected and provided for display during a time slot included in content presented on the client device. For example, a time slot may accommodate different combinations of digital components (or groups of digital components) of different durations. Each of the different combinations of the number components may have an overall score (e.g., a sum of the scores of the number components) based on the scores of the number components included in each combination. In some implementations, the combination with the highest overall score (also referred to as a global score) is selected for the time slot.
These features and additional features will be further described below with reference to fig. 1-4.
Fig. 1 is an example environment 100 in which digital content and digital components are distributed and presented to client devices. The example environment 100 includes a network 110. The network 110 may include a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. The network 110 may also include any type of wired and/or wireless network, satellite network, cable network, wi-Fi network, mobile communication network (e.g., 3G, 4G, 5G, etc.), or any combination thereof. Network 110 may utilize communication protocols, including packet-based and/or datagram-based protocols such as Internet Protocol (IP), transmission Control Protocol (TCP), user Datagram Protocol (UDP), or other types of protocols. The network 110 may also include a plurality of devices, such as switches, routers, gateways, access points, firewalls, base stations, repeaters, or combinations thereof, that facilitate network communications and/or form the hardware basis of the network. Network 110 connects client device 150, content database 160, and content distribution system 140.
The client device 150 is an electronic device capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 110. Example client devices 150 include personal computers, tablet devices, wearable devices, digital assistant devices (e.g., smart speakers), mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 110. Client device 150 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate sending and receiving data over network 110, but a local application executed by client device 150 may also facilitate receiving and sending data over network 110. For example, client device 150A is an example smartphone device executing video streaming application 152. In some implementations, the input accepted by the client device 150 includes audio (e.g., voice) input received through a microphone of the client device. Similarly, the output provided by the client device 150 may be audio (e.g., synthesized speech) output rendered using a speaker that is part of the client device.
The content request 112 may include event data related to other information, such as information already provided by a user of the client device, geographic information indicating a state or region in which the content request 112 was submitted, or other information that provides context for the environment in which the requested content is to be displayed (e.g., the time of day the component requested, the day of the week the component requested, the type of device on which the requested content is to be displayed, such as a mobile device or tablet device). Content request 112 may be transmitted over a packet network, for example, and content request 112 itself may be formatted as packet data having a header and payload data. The header may specify the destination of the packet and the payload data may include any of the information discussed above.
The content distribution system 140 selects content (e.g., video or audio) from the content database 160 to be provided to the client device 150 in response to receiving the content request 112 and/or using information included in the content request 112. In some implementations, the content database 160 includes millions of available content that is indexed. Each index entry may reference corresponding content and specify one or more time slots that have been defined for the corresponding content, where each time slot is a location within the content at which one or more digital components may be provided. In some implementations, each index entry can also include data specifying attributes for each of the one or more time slots for particular content. For example, the index entry may specify one or more time slots, a timestamp for each of the one or more time slots that specifies, for example, a time at which the content begins to be presented from a beginning of the time slot and/or a time at which the content begins to be presented from an end of the time slot, and a duration of each time slot (referred to as T). In another example, each index entry may also include a number of digital components (referred to as N) that may be accommodated in each of the one or more slots and one or more position requirements for the one or more slots.
For example, assume that client device 150A generates a content request 112 for particular content in content database 160 that includes a time slot for providing a digital component. Upon receiving the content request 112, the content distribution system 140 generates a response 114 that includes data needed to render the particular content from the content database 160 and data specifying the time slot attributes needed to render the digital components. In some implementations, the response 114 may include the URL (or another resource identifier) of the content in the content database 160 and attributes of one or more time slots, such as a timestamp of each time slot, a maximum number (N) of digital components that may be sequentially provided within each of the one or more time slots, and a duration (T) of each of the one or more time slots, and optionally a location requirement for the digital components to be rendered during the time slot. The response 114 is transmitted to the client device 150A over the network 110. The client device 150A uses the data received in the response 114 to provide the particular content by, for example, rendering the content via a video streaming application 152 executing on the client device 150A. Client device 150A also renders the digital component using data specifying the slot attributes. For example, data included in response 114 that specifies slot attributes defines a slot and a start (and/or end) timestamp for the slot. The data may further define that the number of digital components that can be provided in a time slot is three, i.e. N =3. The data may further define the time slot to have a duration T of 60 seconds, i.e., T =60 seconds.
In some implementations, after receiving the response 114, the client device 150A generates a request for the digital component based on the data specifying the slot attribute to provide the digital component. Depending on the particular implementation, the client device may generate a single request for the N digital components or generate N requests for a single digital component. Continuing with the above example, client device 150A generates three separate requests 116a, 116b, and 116c for digital components provided during a time slot. Upon receiving each of requests 116a, 116b, and 116c, content distribution system 140 selects digital components dc1, dc2, and dc3 and generates responses 118a, 118b, and 118c, respectively, such that each response includes digital components dc1, dc2, and dc3, respectively. The responses 118a, 118b, and 118c are transmitted to the client device 150A. Client device 150A aborts the display of the content at the timestamp of the time slot and sequentially displays the digital components dc1, dc2, and dc3 included in responses 118a, 118b, and 118 c. Optionally, the N-digital components or resource identifiers (e.g., URLs) of the N-digital components may be provided with the response 114 such that separate requests 116 and responses 118 need not be generated. This has the advantage of reducing the bandwidth and resources required for additional network communications required for requests 116 and responses 118.
In some implementations, the digital components may be characterized by different attributes, such as duration of the digital components, priority of the digital components. For example, digital component provider 130 may provide and/or generate digital components of different durations, which may vary based on the context of the digital components or the digital component distribution policy. For example, the digital component may have a duration of 15 seconds, 30 seconds, or 40 seconds.
In some implementations, each digital component has an associated priority p that represents the importance of delivering and presenting the digital component on the client device. In some implementations, the priority of the digital component is set by the digital component provider 130. For example, digital component provider 130 may begin an activity that promotes a particular product. To promote an activity, digital component provider 130 may provide a plurality of digital components that are contextually relevant to a particular product. To quickly promote the campaign, the digital component provider 130 may assign a priority to the digital components of the campaign. In another example, the digital component provider 130 may assign priorities to certain types of digital components. For example, the digital component provider 130 may assign a higher priority to the video-based digital component than to the audio-based digital component. In some implementations, after receiving the priority associated with each digital component, the content distribution system 140 selects the digital component for delivery to the client device based on the priority. In some implementations, the content distribution system 140 can calculate a priority for each digital component. For example, content distribution system 140 may set priorities for digital components based on the monetary value paid to content distribution system 140 by digital component provider 130. In another example, the content distribution system 130 can preferentially select and deliver the digital components based on the context of the digital components. For example, digital components that are contextually relevant to digital content accessed by a user of a client device may be assigned a higher priority than other digital components. In such implementations, the content distribution system 140 selects or provides (for selection purposes) a higher weight to the digital components for distribution that have a higher priority. For example, assume that there are two types of digital components, where a first type of digital component has a higher priority than a second type of digital component. Because the content distribution system 140 selects (or weights the selection of) the digital components based on priority, the content distribution system 140 is more likely to select a first type of digital component for distribution than a second type of digital component.
When displaying digital components on client devices, content distribution system 140 and digital component provider 130 may wish to fairly select digital components for delivery and display on the client devices. For example, assume that a slot has a duration of 45 seconds, i.e., T =45 seconds, and that the total number of digital components that can be included in the slot is 3, i.e., N =3. Assume further that the content distribution system 140 has a list of digital components with durations of 15, 30, and 40 seconds. Table 1 below shows possible selection configurations that will provide for digital components to be presented in a time slot, assuming that no other factors such as priority are taken into account when selecting the digital components.
TABLE 1
Table 1 shows that a slot having a 45 second duration can accommodate digital components of different durations, with each row in the table representing a combination of digital components selected for the slot. For example, the content distribution system 140 may (1) select a single digital component having a duration of 40 seconds, (2) select a single digital component having a duration of 30 seconds, (3) select three digital components having a duration of 15 seconds, or (4) select two digital components such that a first of the two digital components has a duration of 15 seconds and a second of the two digital components has a duration of 30 seconds.
As mentioned above, the prior art of selecting digital components seeks to maximize the number of digital components that can be presented during a time slot, or to maximize digital component selection with a longer duration. Either way, the selection strategy results in a disproportionate/unfair selection of the shorter duration or longer duration digital components, respectively. Techniques and methods further explained in this document with reference to fig. 2 and 3 help alleviate the above-described problems.
Fig. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process 200 for fairly selecting a number component. The operations of process 200 may be implemented, for example, by content distribution system 140 to select digital components for presentation on client devices. The operations of process 200 may also be embodied as instructions stored on a computer-readable medium, where execution of the instructions may cause one or more data processing devices to perform the operations of process 200.
Although process 200 is explained below with reference to providing digital components that will be displayed sequentially in a particular time slot, the techniques and methods presented in this document may be implemented to provide digital components for presentation in multiple time slots (which may or may not be sequential).
A plurality of digital components are identified (210). The digital component provider 130 provides a plurality of digital components for distribution and display on the client device. The content distribution system 140 that distributes digital components to the client devices 150 may receive multiple digital components from multiple digital component providers 130 for distribution to the client devices as deemed appropriate. In some implementations, the content distribution system 140 can access a catalog/inventory (or list) of digital components that can be provided to different digital component providers 130 of client devices. For example, content distribution system 140 may maintain, for each digital component provider 130, a list of digital components that have been identified by component provider 130 and the corresponding resource locations/URLs for the digital components.
The content distribution system 140 generates a score for each of the plurality of digital components (230). In some implementations, the content distribution system 140 generates a score for each of the plurality of digital components that maintains a proportional and fair distribution of the digital components for different attributes, such as the duration of the digital components, the context of the digital components, or the type of digital component (e.g., only audio or video digital components). The score is based on (i) the duration of the digital component, (ii) the priority of the digital component as determined by the content distribution system, (iii) the satisfaction rate of the digital component, (iv) the location requirement of the digital component, (v) the number of times the digital component can be placed in the time slot given the constraints. The score for each digital component represents the likelihood of whether the digital component will appear in the time slot. The higher the score relative to the other available digital components, the higher the likelihood that the indicative digital component will appear in the time slot. The lower the score relative to the other available digital components, the lower the likelihood that the indicative digital component will appear. The generation of the score for each digital component is further described below with reference to fig. 3.
The content distribution system 140 selects a first set of digital components based on the generated scores (240). In some implementations, based on the generated score for each of the plurality of digital components, the content distribution system 140 selects a first set of digital components that have the highest scores compared to their remaining digital components. For example, assume that the digital component provider 140 has one hundred digital components from which the content distribution system 140 selects and distributes the digital components to client devices. For each of the one hundred digital components, the content distribution system 130 generates a score and selects one or more digital components (referred to as a first set of digital components) having the highest score.
In some implementations, the content distribution system 140 selects the first set of digital components using a selection process that maximizes a global score calculated by summing the individual scores of each selected digital component in the first set. The selection process may include one or more constraints. For example, the selection process may select the digital components such that the total duration of the selected digital components is less than or equal to the duration of the time slot, such that the duration required to continuously display the selected digital components does not exceed the time slot duration. In another example, the selection process may select the digital components in a manner that satisfies the location requirements of each selected digital component.
Another method of selecting a first set of digital components for a time slot is to select multiple sets of digital components based on constraints such as location requirements, maximum duration of the time slot, and duration of the digital components. Once there are multiple sets of digital components, content distribution system 140 may calculate an overall score for each of the multiple sets of digital components based on the scores of the digital components that make up the sets. Finally, the content distribution system 140 may select the set of digital components as the first set having the highest global score among the plurality of sets of digital components. For example, the content distribution system 140 may implement a brute force approach to generate all possible combinations of digital components based on one or more constraints and location requirements. The content distribution system 140 may then generate a global score for each combination of digital components and select the combination with the highest global score as the first group.
In some implementations, the cardinality of the first set of digital components is determined by a total duration of each digital component selected based on the score and a duration of a time slot during which the selected digital component is to be presented on the client device. For example, assume that the time slot when content is presented on a client device is 60 seconds in duration. The content distribution system 140 selects the digital component (e.g., dc 1) with the highest generated score for a duration of 40 seconds. When another digital component is selected, content distribution system 140 may calculate the duration of the time slot remaining after the presentation of digital component dc1, in this case 20 seconds. The content distribution system 140 may then select the digital components that have the second highest score and may fit within the remaining time of the time slot, or generate scores for new digital components and select digital components from among the scores of the newly generated scores and previously generated scores until the maximum number of digital components is selected for the time slot.
The content distribution system 140 provides the first set of digital components to the client device (250). After selecting the first set of digital components based on the generated scores, the content distribution system generates a response for each of the digital component requests from the client devices, wherein each response includes the selected digital components for presentation on the client device. For example, upon receiving each of requests 116a, 116b, and 116c, content distribution system 140 selects digital components dc1, dc2, and dc3 and generates responses 118a, 118b, and 118c such that each response includes digital components dc1, dc2, and dc3, respectively. Responses 118a, 118b, and 118c are transmitted to client device 150A, where they are displayed in time slots during presentation of particular content.
In some implementations, after receiving N requests for digital components, the content distribution system 140 can select fewer than N digital components. For example, upon receiving each of requests 116a, 116b, and 116c, content distribution system 140 selects digital components dc1 and dc2 and generates two responses 118a and 118b that include dc1 and dc2, respectively. It should be noted that the maximum number of digital components (N) is considered an upper limit, and that no more than N digital components can be present in a time slot (and less than N digital components can be present in a time slot).
Fig. 3 is a flowchart of an example process for generating a score for each of a plurality of digital components as described with reference to operation 230 in fig. 2. The operations of process 300 may be implemented, for example, by content distribution system 140 to select digital components for presentation on client devices. The operations of process 300 may also be embodied as instructions stored on a computer-readable medium, where execution of the instructions may cause one or more data processing devices to perform the operations of process 300.
The content distribution system 140 groups the digital components into a plurality of categories (310). In some implementations, the content distribution system 140 groups the digital components into multiple categories based on the duration of each digital component. As described with reference to fig. 1 and 2, digital component provider 130 may create and make available to content distribution system 140 a plurality of digital components to deliver/provide the digital components to client devices. For example, the digital component may have three lengths, such as 15, 30, and 45 seconds. Thus, the content distribution system 140 may generate three sets/classes of digital components: one set/class for digital components having a 15 second duration, another set/class for digital components having a 30 second duration, and another set/class for digital components having a 45 second duration.
In some implementations, the content distribution system 140 can group the digital components into multiple categories based on particular criteria defined according to the duration of the digital components. In some implementations, the criteria may be based on a level of granularity set by a designer and/or user of the system. For example, the qualification criteria for a fine tune class may define a category that may include all digital components having a duration between 20-25 seconds (i.e., greater than 20 seconds and less than 25 seconds). In contrast, the coarse classification may define a category that may include all digital components having a duration between 15-30 seconds (i.e., greater than 15 seconds and less than 30 seconds).
The content distribution system 140 determines a location requirement for each of a plurality of categories (320). In some implementations, the digital component provider 130 may wish to place certain digital components at certain positions relative to other digital components within the time slot. For example, assume that the digital component provider 130 provides digital components belonging to two categories: (i) A class of digital components having a 15 second duration (referred to as class a), and (ii) a class of digital components having a 30 second duration (referred to as class B). If the digital component provider 130 wishes the digital component belonging to category B to be presented on the client device 110 at a location that is neither the first location nor the last location of the digital component in the time slot, the digital component provider 130 declares a location requirement. In another example, the content distribution system 130 may generate the location requirements for the digital component based on the characteristics of the digital component and the digital content accessed by the user of the client device. For example, assume that the content distribution system 130 selects four digital components for delivery and display on a client device based on the context of the digital content accessed by the user. The content distribution system 130 can also determine that presenting two of the four digital components in sequence has a greater significance to the user than presenting the two digital components separately, thereby generating a location requirement for the digital components.
In another example, the location requirements for the digital component within the time slot may be based on how the content distribution system 130 acquires the digital component of the time slot. For example, the content distribution system 130 may specify that the first digital component to be displayed in a time slot of T =45 seconds and N =3 must be acquired through a real-time bidding process, such as an auction. Assume that the digital component selected via this bidding process has a duration of 30 seconds. In this case, the position requirement for the 30 second digital component is that it must be displayed first.
In some implementations, the digital component provider 130 may allow the content distribution system 140 to access a catalog/manifest holding the digital components, the respective location requirements of each digital component, and other attributes of the respective digital component. While generating scores for the digital components, the content distribution system 140 may access the catalog/manifest to access the respective location requirements of the digital components. The content distribution system determines the number of times a digital component from a particular category may be included in a time slot (330). In some implementations, the content distribution system 140 determines the number of times a digital component from a particular category may be included within a time slot based on (i) the maximum number of digital components N that may be provided in the time slot, (ii) a time T that specifies a total duration of the time slot, and (iii) a location requirement for the category. This is illustrated using the following example.
For example, assume that a slot has a duration of 60 seconds (T =60 seconds) and can accommodate a maximum of 3 digital components (N = 3). It is also assumed that the digital components available for the time slot belong to two categories of digital components: (i) A class of digital components having a 15 second duration (referred to as class a), and (ii) a class of digital components having a 30 second duration (referred to as class B). Assume further that the digital component provider 130 has a location requirement of class B that specifies that digital components from class B cannot be placed as the first or last digital component in a time slot. In this case, the content distribution system 140 may select the digital components in the following order:
position 1 | Position 2 | Position 3 |
Digital component from class A | Digital component from class B | Digital component from class A |
In the above example, the numeric component is selected based on the location requirement for category B. In this example, the content distribution system 140 determines that one digital component from category B may be included in the time slot (e.g., in the second location) and that two digital components from category a may be included in the time slot (e.g., in the first and third locations).
In another example, assume that a slot has a duration of 75 seconds (T =75 seconds) and can accommodate a maximum of 3 digital components (N = 3). It is also assumed that the digital components available for the time slot belong to two categories of digital components: (i) A class of digital components having a 15 second duration (referred to as class a), and (ii) a class of digital components having a 30 second duration (referred to as class B). Assume further that the digital component provider 130 has a location requirement of class B that specifies that a digital component from class B cannot be placed as the first digital component in a time slot. In this case, the content distribution system 140 may select the digital components in the following order:
position 1 | Position 2 | Position 3 |
Digital component from class A | Digital component from class B | Digital component from class B |
In this example, the numeric component is selected based on the location requirement for category B. In this example, the content distribution system 140 determines that two digital components from category B may be included in the time slot (e.g., in the second and third locations) and that one digital component from category a may be included in the time slot (e.g., in the first location).
The content distribution system 140 calculates a duration factor (340). In some implementations, the content distribution system 140 calculates a duration factor for each digital component as the inverse of the number of times that a digital component from a particular category may be included in a time slot (as determined in operation 140 above). Continuing from the example above, where the digital component from category B may be included in the time slots of the second and third locations, thereby including the digital component from category B twice, the duration factor of the digital component in category B is 1/2. Similarly, the duration factor of the digital component in category a is 1 (since the component from category a can only be selected 1 time, the reciprocal of 1 is 1).
Based on the priority value, the satisfaction ratio, and the calculated duration factor for the category to which the digital component belongs, the content distribution system 140 generates a score for each of the plurality of digital components (350). In some implementations, a priority value is determined by the content provider system 140 for each digital component or each category of digital components (as described above with reference to fig. 1 and 2). In some implementations, the satisfaction ratio represents the number of digital components of a particular duration that have been previously provided to the client device relative to the total number of digital components of a particular duration that are available for provision to the client device. In some implementations, a satisfaction ratio is calculated for each category of digital component, as described further below.
For each category, the content distribution system 140 determines a target number of digital components of the category to be provided to the client device. For example, assume that the content distribution system 140 has 100 digital components for distribution such that 50 digital components belong to a class a digital component having a duration of 15 seconds and the other 50 digital components belong to a class B digital component having a duration of 30 seconds. In this example, the content distribution system 140 determines that the target number of category a digital components to provide to the client device is 50 and the target number of category B digital components to provide to the client device is 50.
For each category, the content distribution system 140 determines the number of digital components that have previously been provided to the client device. In some implementations, the content distribution system 140 maintains a plurality of digital components for each category that have previously been provided to the client device (e.g., by incrementing a counter for each category each time a digital component for each category is provided). In such implementations, the content distribution system determines the number of digital components that have been previously provided to the client device by accessing the value of the counter for a particular category. For example, assume that the content distribution system 140 has selected 40 digital components from category a and delivered to the client device 150, and selected 15 digital components from category B and delivered to the client device. In this example, the content distribution system 140 determines that the number of category a digital components that have been provided to the client device is 40, and the number of category B digital components that have been provided to the client device is 15. In this example, the number of digital components to be provided yet for category a is 10, and the number of digital components to be provided yet for category B is 35. The content distribution system 140 uses (i) the number of digital components of the category that have been delivered to the client device and that have been displayed, and (ii) the target number of digital components of the category to calculate a satisfaction ratio, as follows:
satisfaction ratio Categories = (number of digital components transferred) Categories /(target number of digital components) Categories
Depending on the implementation, the satisfaction ratio may be a score, a percentage, or any other representation based on the number of numeric components of a category and the target number of numeric components of the category. In some implementations, the satisfaction ratio may be based on the number of digital components delivered to the client device over a particular duration of time. In such implementations, the satisfaction ratio may be based on (i) the number of digital components that should have been delivered over a period of time, regardless of the category of the digital components, and (ii) the expected number of digital components that should have been delivered over the same period of time, regardless of the category of the digital components. For example, assume the number of digital components (X) delivered to the client device over a period of time t Transfer of ) (independent of the category of the digital component) and the expected number (X) of digital components that have been delivered within the same time period t Anticipation of ) (independent of the category of the digital component), the satisfaction ratio can be expressed as
Satisfactory ratio = (X) Transfer of *t)/(X Anticipation of *t)
The content distribution system generates a score for each digital component based on (i) the priority value, (ii) the satisfaction ratio, and (iii) the calculated duration factor for the category to which the digital component belongs. This can be expressed by the following equation:
V(p，d，s)＝F(P)G(d)H(s)
wherein the function V is parameterized by the priority p of the digital component, the duration factor d and the satisfaction ratio r. Functions F, G and H may be functions that map their respective inputs (i.e., p, d, and s) and generate a value for each of their respective inputs that may be used to generate a score. For example, the function G may be a function that characterizes the numeric component based on its class to facilitate a fair distribution of the numeric component among the multiple classes. As previously described with reference to step 310 of process 300, the category of the digital component is based on the duration of the digital component. However, depending on the particular implementation, the categories may be based on one or more characteristics, such as priority, location factor, satisfaction ratio, and/or context of the digital components. The functions F and H may be functions that manipulate the priority p and satisfaction ratio s of the digital components linearly or non-linearly into a value space such that the resulting values of the functions F and H may promote a fair distribution of the digital components. For example, if the function F is proportional to the priority p, the value generated by the function F for digital components having a high priority is relatively higher than the value generated by the function F for digital components having a lower priority. As another example, if the delivery of the digital component lags behind the expected number of digital components to be delivered according to the satisfaction ratio s, the function H may generate a value greater than 0.5. Similarly, if the number of already delivered digital components is greater than the expected number of digital components according to the satisfaction ratio s, the function H may generate a value less than 0.5. In some implementations, the functions F, G and H may take into account constraints imposed by the duration of the slot, the duration of the digital component, and the location requirements of the digital component when calculating the respective generated values.
In some implementations, these functions can be further parameterized and/or defined using learnable parameters. For example, functions F, G and H may be machine learning models that may learn learnable parameters via training by adjusting values of the learnable parameters. For example, the function G may be a machine learning model configured to receive the duration factor d as an input and generate a predicted value that may be used to calculate a score for the digital component. These functions may be determined and modified by the system designer.

selecting, from the plurality of digital components and based on the scores of the plurality of digital components, a first set of digital components having a set of highest scores for provision within the time slot; and
providing the first set of digital components for provision within the time slot during display of the particular content on a client device.
14. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 13, wherein generating the score is further based on: (i) A priority value assigned to the digital component, wherein the priority value represents an importance of providing the digital component to the client device, and (ii) a satisfaction ratio representing a number of digital components of a particular duration that have been previously provided to the client device for display relative to a total number of particular digital components available for provision to the client device.
15. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 13 or 14, wherein the number of times the digital component is available for provision within the time slot is based on: (ii) a maximum number N of the digital components, (ii) a time T specifying a total duration of the time slots, and (iii) a position requirement for the digital components.
16. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 14, wherein the score is generated based on: (ii) a duration of the digital component, (ii) a location requirement for the digital component, and (iii) a number of times the digital component can be provided within the N available locations, including:
grouping digital components into a plurality of categories based on their duration;
determining a location requirement for each of the plurality of categories, wherein the location requirement for each category specifies a particular location of a time slot in which a numeric component of the category is to be provided for display;
for each category, determining a number of times that a numeric component from each category can be provided for display within the time slot based on (i) a maximum number, N, of numeric components that can be provided in the time slot, (ii) a time, T, that specifies a total duration of the time slot, and (iii) a location requirement for the category;
calculating a duration factor for each category as an inverse of the number of times a digital component from the category can be included in the time slot; and
generating the score for each of the plurality of digital components based on (i) the priority value, (ii) the satisfaction ratio, and (iii) a calculated duration factor of a category to which the digital component belongs.
17. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of any preceding claim, wherein the number M of available positions comprises M sequential positions.
18. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of any preceding claim, further comprising generating the satisfaction ratio comprising:
identifying a plurality of categories of digital components of different durations, wherein each category represents a group of digital components of a particular duration;
for each category:
determining a target number of digital components to be provided to the client device;
determining a number of digital components that have previously been provided to the client device for display;
calculating a ratio based on the target number and a number of digital components that have previously been provided to the client device for display; and
generating a satisfaction index based on the calculated ratios of the plurality of categories.
