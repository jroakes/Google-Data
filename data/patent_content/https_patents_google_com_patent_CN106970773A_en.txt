It is the type based on media item, genre information or other metadata.If for example, media item is regarding for the people that gives a lecture
Frequently, then acquiescence ALA values can be corresponding with the raising of audio level.Equally, if media item is the video of concert, give tacit consent to
ALA values can be corresponding with the reduction of audio level.There may be the rule being stored in media data storage 128, if its
Its instruction is unavailable, then the rule makes ALA modules 122 set acquiescence ALA values.If with the request phase of media player applications 114
The user of association has the account on media server 120, then ALA modules 122 can store 130 according to account data is stored in
In user profile come adjust acquiescence ALA values.If for example, user more often sent than other users turn down it is certain type of
Therefore the voice command of media item, then can change ALA values.
ALA modules 122 based on specific first and second media item to corresponding audio level directory entry come really
Poor (ALD) value of fixed 410 audio levels.ALD values are each in the audio level directory entry for the certain media items pair
Total poor numerical value between the main audio level and secondary audio program level of entry is represented.For example, can be by pair with first and second
The difference of each entry in the corresponding entry of media item is averaged, intermediate value or mode determine ALD values.For example, returning
To Fig. 3, if the first media item ID is ' Cat.mov ' and the second media item ID is ' Pig.mov ', can by
' Cat.mov ' as the first media item ID and ' Pig.mov ' as the second media item ID four differences 326 are averaged
To determine ALD.Average value can be (33+23+0-4) ÷ 4=+13.Therefore, the ALD for media item sequence can be+13.
According to embodiment, in addition to aforesaid way, ALD can be calculated in a number of different ways.It is, for example, possible to use in
Value, mode, more complicated function, changeability that abnormal data can be abandoned to reduce result etc..
In one embodiment, ALA modules 122 using the subset of the audio level directory entry for media item pair come
Determine ALD values.For example, ALA modules 122 only can use audio level to be changed into from main audio level during some period
The entry of secondary audio program level.For example, the period can be first 30 seconds that the second media item is presented.The embodiment is based on such as
It is lower to assume：If the intensity of sound for the second media item is not appropriate, user is more likely in closer second media
The presentation of item adjusts audio level when starting.On the contrary, being due to unlikely that unsuitable sound is strong the adjustment in later stage is presented
Degree.Therefore, carrying out analysis to entry in disable time section allows ALA modules 122 to determine more likely to cause to be directed to the second media
The ALA values of the more appropriate intensity of sound of item.
In addition to based on from the default value obtained by media item metadata and user profile, ALA values can be based on institute really
Fixed ALD values.ALA values can be equal to ALD values.In another embodiment, ALA modules 122 determine whether identified ALD values surpass
Cross the threshold value for adjusting ALA values.If ALD values exceed threshold value, ALA modules 122 adjust 415ALA values to handle
(account for) audio level is poor.The adjustment of ALA values can be proportional to ALD.If ALD values are no more than threshold value, not right
ALA values are adjusted.In the case where adjustment will be user's invisible minute or relevant with the ALA that user is initiated
In the case of the clear pattern for the adjustment that the not shown user of data is initiated, it is desirable to which ALD values, which exceed threshold value, can preserve calculating money
Source.
New ALA directory entries are added 420 to the ALA indexes being stored in media data storage 128 by ALA modules 122.
In addition to the ALA values that the ALA directory entries of acquiescence and user specify, the ALA directory entries based on ALD values also include such as the
One and second media item pair media item ID data and identified ALA values.
There can be multiple possible ALA values to corresponding ALA directory entries with specific media item.Certain media items
Treated and different audio output apparatus 118 is being used together or different ALA values corresponding with different user to that can have.
For example, ALA modules 122 can be to be determined individually from the corresponding audio level directory entry of different audio output apparatus 118
ALD values, and different ALA values are stored in media item in corresponding ALA directory entries.This can be by handling
Intensity of sound between different users and different types of audio output apparatus 118 changes to produce more preferable Consumer's Experience.
It can be performed according to order different illustrated in Fig. 4 it is determined that various during ALA values
Step.Request in response to the media item for media item centering from media player applications 114 or in service
Under the requirement of device 120 or another logical process, the step come in implementation procedure can be spaced to schedule.
