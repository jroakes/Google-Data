Definitions
- This disclosure relates to systems and methods for providing a list of destination recommendations to a social group. More particularly, this disclosure describes systems and methods for first identifying a social group based on a combination of location-based signals and social graph information and then providing a group recommendation based at least in part on the personal preference profiles of each member of the social group.
- a method for providing destination recommendations to social groups comprises receiving, at a group recommendation system, a recommendation request from a remote computing device associated with a requesting user, identifying by the system a preliminary social group based on one or more location-based signals received from one or more remote computing devices, identifying those members of the preliminary social group that meet a social connection threshold to define a social group, generating a group recommendation list comprising recommendations for where to go next, and displaying the group recommendation list on the remote computing device of at least the requesting user.
- a system and a computer program product for providing destination recommendations to social groups are provided.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting a system for identifying and providing suggested destinations to members of a social group, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
- FIG. 2 is a block flow diagram depicting a method to provide destination recommendation based on the composition of an identified social group, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
- FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method to identify members of a social group based on location-based signals and social graph information, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
- FIG. 4 is a block flow diagram depicting a method to generate group destination recommendations, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram depicting a computing machine and a module, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
- a social group may comprise a group of individuals who are at the same location and would like recommendations on where to go next.
- the system can identify members of the social group based on a combination of location-based signals and social graph information. After the composition of a social group is determined, the system can generate a list of suggested destinations tailored to the group.
- Location-based signals that refer to the same location, or within a defined proximity threshold may be used to define a preliminary social group. Location-based signals may only be acquired by the system if the user has given prior permission to share such location-based signals from their remote computing device. For example, the user may set their default preference for sharing location based signals in an account associated with the user and stored on the system. Alternatively, an application executing on the remote computing device may prompt the user to provide permission to share a location-based signal with the system. Location-based signals may be explicit location-based signals, implicit-location based signals, or a combination thereof Explicit location-based signals may include signals received from a remote computing device associate with a member of a social group, such as the check-in feature available in a social network application.
- Implicit location-based signals may include signals that are associated with another user's explicit location-based signal.
- social networking services may allow a user to tag other users when the user checks-in to a location.
- a user may also tag another user in a photo when uploading the photo to a social network. The tagged user may then be associated with the location of the check-in or photo.
- the process for providing a destination recommendation is initiated when the system receives a location-based signal from a mobile computing device associated with a user.
- the location-based signal provides a current location of the mobile computing device.
- the user may explicitly initiate a destination recommendation request.
- the user may elect to allow the mobile computing device to provide updated location information to the system and allow the system to surface destination recommendations automatically.
- the system determines if the user is part of a social group, the system then identifies other users with location-based signals that have been received by the system and that are within a defined proximity and time threshold of the requesting user. For example, the system may look for other users that have checked-in to the same location within a defined time window.
- the system may look for location-based signals that fit the defined proximity and time thresholds only for users who are within a social connection threshold to the requesting user. For example, the system may look for location-based signals received only from remote computing devices associated with users that are within one step in a social graph of the requesting user.
- each member may be required to have at least one social network connection with every member of the group.
- each member may be required to share at least one common social network connection with at least one other member of the social group, but may have less than a social network connection with every member of the group. For example, a first user and a second user may both have a common social network connection to a third user, but not have a direct social network connection between the first and second users.
- the system After a social group is identified, the system then generates a ranked group recommendation comprising a list of suggested destinations for the group.
- the ranked group recommendation takes into account the personal preferences of each member of the group.
- the system may send a verification to the requesting user or all members of the group giving them the option to confirm whether they are members of the same social group.
- the ranked social group recommendation is generated by first generating individual recommendation lists for each user based on a personal profile of each member of the social group. For example, the system may apply a recommendation algorithm to a personal profile associated with each user to generate the individual recommendation list.
- a group recommendation is then prepared comprising destinations from the individual recommendation lists.
- the group recommendation may include only destinations that appears on at least two individual recommendation lists.
- Each recommendation may be ranked according to a composite score. For example, the composite score may be determined by adding together the score that a recommendation received on each individual recommendation list.
- the system generates the ranked social group recommendation list by merging the personal preference profile of each group member to generate a master preference profile. The same algorithm that is applied to generate individual recommendations is then applied to the master preference profile to generate the ranked group recommendation.
- the system then displays the ranked group recommendations on the remote computing device associated with the requesting user.
- the system may also display the group recommendations on the remote computing devices associated with other members of the group.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting a system for identifying and providing suggested destinations to members of a social group, in accordance with certain example embodiments.

- the application 111 can interact with web servers or other computing devices connected to the network 105 , including the group recommendation system 120 .
- remote computing devices 110 a - c and group recommendation system 120 illustrated in FIG. 1 can have any of several other suitable computer system configurations.
- a remote computing device 110 embodied as a mobile phone or handheld computer may not include all the components described above.
- FIG. 2-4 The example methods illustrated in FIG. 2-4 are described hereinafter with respect to the components of the example operating environment 100 .
- the example methods of FIG. 2-4 may also be performed with other systems and in other operating environments.
- FIG. 2 is a block flow diagram depicting a method 200 to provide destination recommendations based on the composition of an identified social group, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
- Method 200 begins at block 205 where the group module 121 detects a location-based signal from a remote computing device 110 a.
- the user may have enabled a location history function on the remote computing device that sends a set of time-stamped GPS coordinates to the group module 121 at regularly timed intervals.
- the user may communicate a recommendation request to the destination recommendation system.
- the user may be at a restaurant and may wish to receive a list of suggested destinations on where to go next.
- the requesting user may have a user account stored in the user preference index 123 .
- the user account stores a user preference profile.
- the personal preference profile may cover a wide variety of subjects.
- the user may specify favorite restaurants, by name or type, favorite neighborhoods, favorite retailers, a preferred price range, and preferred attractions or concerts, among other items.
- a user may also score or weight how important a given factor in the personal profile is to the recommendations they would like to see. For example, a user may specify that a particular type of restaurant in a particular neighborhood is a more important factor than price.
- a user's personal preferences may be inferred from behavior of the user on the system or related applications. For example, a personal preference for a particular restaurant may be inferred from repeated check-ins at the same location, the writing of a review after visiting a given location, or bookmarking of locations.
- the request for a destination recommendation may include a general request for all recommended suggestions, or the request may specify certain categories of destinations such as a theater, a museum, or a bar.
- the suggestion module 121 determines whether the user is part of a social group by identifying other potential members of the social group based on location-based signals and social graph information. Block 210 will be described in further detail with reference to FIG. 3 below.
- FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method 210 to identify members of a social group, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
- Method 210 begins at block 305 , where the group module 121 receives a location-based signal from the remote computing device 110 a.
- the location-based signal may be included in the destination recommendation request discussed above in reference to block 205 .
- the suggestion module 122 may communicate a request to provide current location information to the remote computing device 110 a in response to receiving the destination recommendation request.
- the location-based signals may include an explicit location-based signal received from the remote computing device 110 a, such as a GPS location from a GPS application of the remote computing device 110 a or the check-in feature available in a social network application.
- the application 111 may request location data from an operating system of the remote computing device 110 a. Access to and transmission of location-based signals by the application 111 may only be performed with prior consent from the user.
- the group module 121 uses the location information included in the location-based signal received from the remote computing device 110 a to determine if other users associated with other remote computing devices 110 , for example remote computing devices 110 b - c, are nearby.
- the group module 121 may use a predetermined proximity threshold to determine if location-based signals from other remote computing devices 110 b - c are within the predetermined proximity threshold.
- the proximity threshold may require the other remote computing devices 110 b - c to be checked-in to the same location as remote computing device 110 a.
- the proximity threshold may define a distance threshold that the remote computing devices 110 b - c have to be within to be considered nearby.
- the distance threshold can be calibrated based on the time or location of the remote computing device 110 a. For example, if remote computing device 110 a is at a restaurant the distance threshold may be relatively small, for example within 50 feet and the time threshold relatively low, for example, the typical time it would take to complete a meal. If the remote computing device 110 a is checked in at a theme park or multi-venue sporting or music event that spans several acres, the distance threshold may be defined in hundreds or thousands of feet and the time threshold may be expanded.
- the location-based signals may be explicit.
- a location-based signal such as a check-in
- the location-based signal may also include implicit location-based signals.
- social networking services allow a user to tag other users in their social network when the user checks-in to a location.
- a user may also tag another user in a photo when uploading the photo to a social network.
- a photo may have GPS and time metadata associated with it by the camera application that took the photo.
- a photo may also be associated with a location when the photo is attached to a check-in at a given location. The photo does not have to be taken by a member of the social group.
- a photo that associates a potential member of the social group with the location of the requesting user or preliminary social group can be taken by a user who is not included in the social group.
- the group module 121 may require the implicit-location signal to be within a defined time threshold. For example, if a user has been tagged in a photo, the group module 121 may determine that the tag was added within a defined time threshold to ensure the tag was a recent tag and thereby increase the likelihood the tagged user is at the same location as the preliminary social group. In certain example embodiments, the group module 121 may also determine the date and time of the upload of the photo and exclude any photos outside the time threshold even if the potential social group member has been tagged by a current social group member.
- the method proceeds to block 315 . If the group module 121 does not determine that remote computing devices 110 b - c arc nearby, then the method returns to block 305 and waits to receive a location-based signal from a user requesting a recommendation search. In certain other example embodiments, the system may proceed instead to provide an individual destination recommendation to the requesting user, for example, as described below in reference to block 405 .
- the group module 121 uses social graph information associated with the requesting user to select those users identified in block 310 above that also meet a predetermined social connection threshold.
- the users that meet the social connection threshold define a final social group.
- the group module 121 may identify only those users that have a direct connection to the requesting user.
- the group module 121 may include users that are within a defined number of steps on the requesting user's social graph.
- the group module 121 may include users that are not connected to the requesting user but are directly connected to a second user that is in turn directly connected to the requesting user.
- the group module 121 may include users that have a defined number of users in common in their respective social graphs.
- the group module 121 may communicate a request to remote computing device 110 a to access the social graph information of the requesting user, for example by requesting the user login in to their social network account, wherein the login authorizes a social network server 124 to share social graph information with the group module 121 .
- the social network server 124 may be part of the group recommendation system 120 and accessed by the same user account login.
- the group module 121 first identifies all users for which the group module 121 has received location-based information and determines if any remote computing device 110 is within the defined proximity threshold. For example, the group module 121 may store location-based information in a data structure for a defined period of time. For example, the group module 121 may time stamp a location-based signal and store the remote computing device 110 location information from the location-based signal in an index, where the index deletes the stored location information at a set time interval. The suggestion module 121 then determines if any of the identified remote computing devices 110 meet the social connection threshold.
- the group module 121 may first perform block 315 to identify those users that meet the social connection threshold, and then define the social group by determining if a location-based signal has been received for one or more of those users as described in block 310 above.
- the group module 121 may communicate a social group confirmation to one or more members of the identified social group.
- the social group confirmation may only be communicated to the requesting user, or may be communicated to each member of the group.
- a user may then confirm they are a member of the social group or opt out of being included in the social group. The method then proceeds to block 215 of FIG. 2 .
- the suggestion module 122 generates a ranked destination recommendation list based on the personal preference profiles of each member of the group. Block 215 is described in further detail hereinafter with reference to FIG. 4 .
- FIG. 4 is a block flow diagram depicting a method 215 to generate ranked destination recommendations based on the personal preference profiles of each member of the social group, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
- Method 215 begins at block 405 , where the suggestion module 122 generates a personal recommendation for each member based at least in part on each user's personal preference profile.
- the suggestion module 122 may access a user preference profile index 123 .
- the user preference profile index 123 stores a preference profile.
- the preference profile may be created by the user when the user registers with the group recommendation system 120 as referenced in block 205 above, or may be obtained from an associated non-group-based recommendation system.
- the group recommendation system 120 provides individual as well as group-based recommendations.
- a user's personal preferences may be inferred from behavior of the user on the system or related applications.
- a personal preference for a particular restaurant may be inferred from repeated check-ins at the same location, the writing of a review after visiting a given location, or bookmarking of locations.
- the preferences in a preference profile are used to focus the recommendation for that user and to emphasize or highlight results that match the personal preference profile.
- the group recommendation system 120 generates a list of recommendations for a user based on their personal profile using a recommendation ranking algorithm.
- the recommendation ranking algorithm generates a list of recommendations for the user with a score for each recommendation based on how closely the recommendation matches one or more criteria of the personal preference profile. The recommendations may be ranked or given a score value.
- a recommendation that matches multiple criteria in a user's preference profile may be given a higher score than a recommendation that matches on a single criteria in a user's preference profile.
- the suggestion module 122 generates a personal recommendation list for each member of the social group.
- the suggestion module 122 calculates a composite score for each recommendation based, at least in part, on the individual rank the recommendation received in each personal recommendation list. For example, the suggestion module 122 may identify common recommendations that occur in multiple personal recommendation lists and calculate a composite score for that recommendation.
- the composite recommendation may be calculated by adding the rank or score value each recommendation list achieved on each personal recommendation list. For example, if recommendation A had a score of 10 on user A's personal recommendation list, a score of 5 on user B's personal recommendation list, and a score of 7 on user C's personal recommendation list, the composite score would be 22 .
- the composite score is calculated by multiplying the scores assigned to a common recommendation on multiple personal recommendation list.
- the suggestion module 122 then generates a ranked group recommendation list based on at least the calculated composite score for each recommendation. For example, the suggestion module 122 may generate a ranked recommendation list with the recommendations ranked from highest to lowest based on the composite score of each recommendation.
- the individual personal profiles of each member of the group are first merged into a group recommendation profile.
- the suggestion module will merge the personal profiles of group members A, B, and C into a single group suggestion profile.
- the suggestion module 122 then applies the same ranking algorithm used for individual recommendation list to generate a group recommendation list.
- the method 215 then proceeds to block 220 of FIG. 2 .
- the suggestion module 122 communicates the group recommendation list to the remote computing device 110 a for display on the remote computing device 110 a.
- the group recommendation list may be displayed to the requesting user on the remote computing device 110 a via the application 111 .
- the group recommendation list is communicated to all members of the social group via the remote computing devices 110 b, 110 c or other remote computing devices 110 .
- the group recommendation list may be communicated to the other users in the social group from remote computing device 110 a.
- the requesting user may share the group recommendation list with other members of the social group by communicating the group recommendation list to the remote computing devices 110 associated with the other members using NFC or other suitable communication medium.

Abstract
Description
- This disclosure relates to systems and methods for providing a list of destination recommendations to a social group. More particularly, this disclosure describes systems and methods for first identifying a social group based on a combination of location-based signals and social graph information and then providing a group recommendation based at least in part on the personal preference profiles of each member of the social group.
- When people go out to explore restaurants, pubs, attractions, and recreational venues, they tend to do so in groups. They also tend to report their activity using social network features like posts, photos, and check-ins. After deciding to leave one location, they may want recommendations regarding where to go next. Users desire to obtain a set of recommended destinations on their mobile communication device that not only provide recommendations based on their individual personal preferences but are also based on the personal preferences of other members in their group.
- In certain example embodiments described herein, a method for providing destination recommendations to social groups comprises receiving, at a group recommendation system, a recommendation request from a remote computing device associated with a requesting user, identifying by the system a preliminary social group based on one or more location-based signals received from one or more remote computing devices, identifying those members of the preliminary social group that meet a social connection threshold to define a social group, generating a group recommendation list comprising recommendations for where to go next, and displaying the group recommendation list on the remote computing device of at least the requesting user.
- In certain other example embodiments described herein, a system and a computer program product for providing destination recommendations to social groups are provided.
- These and other aspects, objects, features, and advantages of the example embodiments will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of illustrated example embodiments.
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting a system for identifying and providing suggested destinations to members of a social group, in accordance with certain example embodiments. -
FIG. 2 is a block flow diagram depicting a method to provide destination recommendation based on the composition of an identified social group, in accordance with certain example embodiments. -
FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method to identify members of a social group based on location-based signals and social graph information, in accordance with certain example embodiments. -
FIG. 4 is a block flow diagram depicting a method to generate group destination recommendations, in accordance with certain example embodiments. -
FIG. 5 is a block diagram depicting a computing machine and a module, in accordance with certain example embodiments. - The embodiments described herein provide a system and method for identifying and providing suggested destinations to members of a social group. For example, a social group may comprise a group of individuals who are at the same location and would like recommendations on where to go next. In certain example embodiments, the system can identify members of the social group based on a combination of location-based signals and social graph information. After the composition of a social group is determined, the system can generate a list of suggested destinations tailored to the group.
- Location-based signals that refer to the same location, or within a defined proximity threshold may be used to define a preliminary social group. Location-based signals may only be acquired by the system if the user has given prior permission to share such location-based signals from their remote computing device. For example, the user may set their default preference for sharing location based signals in an account associated with the user and stored on the system. Alternatively, an application executing on the remote computing device may prompt the user to provide permission to share a location-based signal with the system. Location-based signals may be explicit location-based signals, implicit-location based signals, or a combination thereof Explicit location-based signals may include signals received from a remote computing device associate with a member of a social group, such as the check-in feature available in a social network application. Implicit location-based signals may include signals that are associated with another user's explicit location-based signal. For example, social networking services may allow a user to tag other users when the user checks-in to a location. Alternatively, a user may also tag another user in a photo when uploading the photo to a social network. The tagged user may then be associated with the location of the check-in or photo.
- The process for providing a destination recommendation is initiated when the system receives a location-based signal from a mobile computing device associated with a user. The location-based signal provides a current location of the mobile computing device. The user may explicitly initiate a destination recommendation request. Alternatively, the user may elect to allow the mobile computing device to provide updated location information to the system and allow the system to surface destination recommendations automatically. To determine if the user is part of a social group, the system then identifies other users with location-based signals that have been received by the system and that are within a defined proximity and time threshold of the requesting user. For example, the system may look for other users that have checked-in to the same location within a defined time window. In certain example embodiments, the system may look for location-based signals that fit the defined proximity and time thresholds only for users who are within a social connection threshold to the requesting user. For example, the system may look for location-based signals received only from remote computing devices associated with users that are within one step in a social graph of the requesting user. In one example embodiment, each member may be required to have at least one social network connection with every member of the group. In another example embodiment, each member may be required to share at least one common social network connection with at least one other member of the social group, but may have less than a social network connection with every member of the group. For example, a first user and a second user may both have a common social network connection to a third user, but not have a direct social network connection between the first and second users.
- After a social group is identified, the system then generates a ranked group recommendation comprising a list of suggested destinations for the group. The ranked group recommendation takes into account the personal preferences of each member of the group. In certain example embodiments, the system may send a verification to the requesting user or all members of the group giving them the option to confirm whether they are members of the same social group. In one example embodiment, the ranked social group recommendation is generated by first generating individual recommendation lists for each user based on a personal profile of each member of the social group. For example, the system may apply a recommendation algorithm to a personal profile associated with each user to generate the individual recommendation list. A group recommendation is then prepared comprising destinations from the individual recommendation lists. For example, the group recommendation may include only destinations that appears on at least two individual recommendation lists. Each recommendation may be ranked according to a composite score. For example, the composite score may be determined by adding together the score that a recommendation received on each individual recommendation list.
- In another example embodiment, the system generates the ranked social group recommendation list by merging the personal preference profile of each group member to generate a master preference profile. The same algorithm that is applied to generate individual recommendations is then applied to the master preference profile to generate the ranked group recommendation.
- The system then displays the ranked group recommendations on the remote computing device associated with the requesting user. In certain example embodiments, the system may also display the group recommendations on the remote computing devices associated with other members of the group.
- Turning now to the drawings, in which like numerals represent like (but not necessarily identical) elements throughout the figures, example embodiments are described in detail.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting a system for identifying and providing suggested destinations to members of a social group, in accordance with certain example embodiments. As depicted inFIG. 1 , theoperating environment 100 includes network computing devices 110 a-c and 120 that are configured to communicate with one another via one ormore networks 105. In some embodiments, a user associated with remote computing devices 110 a-c must install an application and/or make a feature selection to obtain the benefits of the techniques described herein. - Each
network 105 includes a wired or wireless telecommunication means by which network devices (including devices 110 a-c and 120) can exchange data. For example, eachnetwork 105 can include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), an intranet, an Internet, storage area network (SAN), personal area network (PAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wireless local area network (WLAN), a virtual private network (VPN), a cellular or other mobile communication network, Bluetooth, NFC, or any combination thereof or any other appropriate architecture or system that facilitates the communication of signals, data, and/or messages. Throughout the discussion of example embodiments, it should be understood that the terms “data” and “information” are used interchangeably herein to refer to text, images, audio, video, or any other form of information that can exist in a computer-based environment. - Each network device 110 a-c and 120 includes a device having a communication module capable of transmitting and receiving data over the
network 105. For example, each network device 110 a-c and 120 can include a server, desktop computer, laptop computer, tablet computer, a television with one or more processors embedded therein and / or coupled thereto, smart phone, handheld computer, personal digital assistant (“PDA”), or any other wired or wireless, processor-driven device. In the example embodiment depicted inFIG. 1 , the network devices (including devices 110 a-c and 120) are operated by end-users or consumers (not depicted), andgroup recommendation system 120 operators (not depicted), respectively. - A user can use an
application 111 on the remote computing device 110 , such as a web browser application or a stand-alone application, to view, download, upload, or otherwise access documents or web pages via thenetwork 105. Theapplication 111 can interact with web servers or other computing devices connected to thenetwork 105, including thegroup recommendation system 120. - It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are example and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers and devices can be used. Moreover, those having ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the present disclosure will appreciate that the remote computing devices 110 a-c and
group recommendation system 120 illustrated inFIG. 1 can have any of several other suitable computer system configurations. For example a remote computing device 110 embodied as a mobile phone or handheld computer may not include all the components described above. - The example methods illustrated in
FIG. 2-4 are described hereinafter with respect to the components of theexample operating environment 100. The example methods ofFIG. 2-4 may also be performed with other systems and in other operating environments. -
FIG. 2 is a block flow diagram depicting amethod 200 to provide destination recommendations based on the composition of an identified social group, in accordance with certain example embodiments. -
Method 200 begins atblock 205 where thegroup module 121 detects a location-based signal from aremote computing device 110 a. For example, the user may have enabled a location history function on the remote computing device that sends a set of time-stamped GPS coordinates to thegroup module 121 at regularly timed intervals. In certain example embodiments, the user may communicate a recommendation request to the destination recommendation system. For example, the user may be at a restaurant and may wish to receive a list of suggested destinations on where to go next. The requesting user may have a user account stored in the user preference index 123. The user account stores a user preference profile. The personal preference profile may cover a wide variety of subjects. For example, the user may specify favorite restaurants, by name or type, favorite neighborhoods, favorite retailers, a preferred price range, and preferred attractions or concerts, among other items. A user may also score or weight how important a given factor in the personal profile is to the recommendations they would like to see. For example, a user may specify that a particular type of restaurant in a particular neighborhood is a more important factor than price. In certain example embodiments, a user's personal preferences may be inferred from behavior of the user on the system or related applications. For example, a personal preference for a particular restaurant may be inferred from repeated check-ins at the same location, the writing of a review after visiting a given location, or bookmarking of locations. The request for a destination recommendation may include a general request for all recommended suggestions, or the request may specify certain categories of destinations such as a theater, a museum, or a bar. - At
block 210, thesuggestion module 121 determines whether the user is part of a social group by identifying other potential members of the social group based on location-based signals and social graph information.Block 210 will be described in further detail with reference toFIG. 3 below. -
FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting amethod 210 to identify members of a social group, in accordance with certain example embodiments.Method 210 begins atblock 305, where thegroup module 121 receives a location-based signal from theremote computing device 110 a. In certain example embodiments, the location-based signal may be included in the destination recommendation request discussed above in reference to block 205. In certain other example embodiments, thesuggestion module 122 may communicate a request to provide current location information to theremote computing device 110 a in response to receiving the destination recommendation request. The location-based signals may include an explicit location-based signal received from theremote computing device 110 a, such as a GPS location from a GPS application of theremote computing device 110 a or the check-in feature available in a social network application. In other example embodiments, theapplication 111 may request location data from an operating system of theremote computing device 110 a. Access to and transmission of location-based signals by theapplication 111 may only be performed with prior consent from the user. - At
block 310, thegroup module 121 uses the location information included in the location-based signal received from theremote computing device 110 a to determine if other users associated with other remote computing devices 110, for exampleremote computing devices 110 b-c, are nearby. Thegroup module 121 may use a predetermined proximity threshold to determine if location-based signals from otherremote computing devices 110 b-c are within the predetermined proximity threshold. In certain example embodiments, the proximity threshold may require the otherremote computing devices 110 b-c to be checked-in to the same location asremote computing device 110 a. In other example embodiments, the proximity threshold may define a distance threshold that theremote computing devices 110 b-c have to be within to be considered nearby. The distance threshold can be calibrated based on the time or location of theremote computing device 110 a. For example, ifremote computing device 110 a is at a restaurant the distance threshold may be relatively small, for example within 50 feet and the time threshold relatively low, for example, the typical time it would take to complete a meal. If theremote computing device 110 a is checked in at a theme park or multi-venue sporting or music event that spans several acres, the distance threshold may be defined in hundreds or thousands of feet and the time threshold may be expanded. - The location-based signals may be explicit. For example, a location-based signal, such as a check-in, is received directly from the mobile computing device associated with the user. The location-based signal may also include implicit location-based signals. For example, social networking services allow a user to tag other users in their social network when the user checks-in to a location. Alternatively, a user may also tag another user in a photo when uploading the photo to a social network. A photo may have GPS and time metadata associated with it by the camera application that took the photo. A photo may also be associated with a location when the photo is attached to a check-in at a given location. The photo does not have to be taken by a member of the social group. A photo that associates a potential member of the social group with the location of the requesting user or preliminary social group can be taken by a user who is not included in the social group. In certain example embodiments, the
group module 121 may require the implicit-location signal to be within a defined time threshold. For example, if a user has been tagged in a photo, thegroup module 121 may determine that the tag was added within a defined time threshold to ensure the tag was a recent tag and thereby increase the likelihood the tagged user is at the same location as the preliminary social group. In certain example embodiments, thegroup module 121 may also determine the date and time of the upload of the photo and exclude any photos outside the time threshold even if the potential social group member has been tagged by a current social group member. - If the
group module 121 determines that other users associated with otherremote computing devices 110 b-c are nearby, then the method proceeds to block 315. If thegroup module 121 does not determine thatremote computing devices 110 b-c arc nearby, then the method returns to block 305 and waits to receive a location-based signal from a user requesting a recommendation search. In certain other example embodiments, the system may proceed instead to provide an individual destination recommendation to the requesting user, for example, as described below in reference to block 405. - In
block 315, thegroup module 121 uses social graph information associated with the requesting user to select those users identified inblock 310 above that also meet a predetermined social connection threshold. The users that meet the social connection threshold define a final social group. For example, thegroup module 121 may identify only those users that have a direct connection to the requesting user. In other example embodiments, thegroup module 121 may include users that are within a defined number of steps on the requesting user's social graph. In other example embodiments, thegroup module 121 may include users that are not connected to the requesting user but are directly connected to a second user that is in turn directly connected to the requesting user. In yet other example embodiments, thegroup module 121 may include users that have a defined number of users in common in their respective social graphs. Thegroup module 121 may communicate a request toremote computing device 110 a to access the social graph information of the requesting user, for example by requesting the user login in to their social network account, wherein the login authorizes asocial network server 124 to share social graph information with thegroup module 121. In certain example embodiments, thesocial network server 124 may be part of thegroup recommendation system 120 and accessed by the same user account login. - In another example embodiment, the
group module 121 first identifies all users for which thegroup module 121 has received location-based information and determines if any remote computing device 110 is within the defined proximity threshold. For example, thegroup module 121 may store location-based information in a data structure for a defined period of time. For example, thegroup module 121 may time stamp a location-based signal and store the remote computing device 110 location information from the location-based signal in an index, where the index deletes the stored location information at a set time interval. Thesuggestion module 121 then determines if any of the identified remote computing devices 110 meet the social connection threshold. - In certain example embodiments, the
group module 121 may first performblock 315 to identify those users that meet the social connection threshold, and then define the social group by determining if a location-based signal has been received for one or more of those users as described inblock 310 above. - At
block 320, thegroup module 121 may communicate a social group confirmation to one or more members of the identified social group. For example the social group confirmation may only be communicated to the requesting user, or may be communicated to each member of the group. A user may then confirm they are a member of the social group or opt out of being included in the social group. The method then proceeds to block 215 ofFIG. 2 . - Returning to block 215 of
FIG. 2 , thesuggestion module 122 generates a ranked destination recommendation list based on the personal preference profiles of each member of the group.Block 215 is described in further detail hereinafter with reference toFIG. 4 . -
FIG. 4 is a block flow diagram depicting amethod 215 to generate ranked destination recommendations based on the personal preference profiles of each member of the social group, in accordance with certain example embodiments. -
Method 215 begins atblock 405, where thesuggestion module 122 generates a personal recommendation for each member based at least in part on each user's personal preference profile. For example, thesuggestion module 122 may access a user preference profile index 123. For each registered user of thesystem 120, the user preference profile index 123 stores a preference profile. The preference profile may be created by the user when the user registers with thegroup recommendation system 120 as referenced inblock 205 above, or may be obtained from an associated non-group-based recommendation system. In certain example embodiments, thegroup recommendation system 120 provides individual as well as group-based recommendations. In certain example embodiments, a user's personal preferences may be inferred from behavior of the user on the system or related applications. For example, a personal preference for a particular restaurant may be inferred from repeated check-ins at the same location, the writing of a review after visiting a given location, or bookmarking of locations. The preferences in a preference profile are used to focus the recommendation for that user and to emphasize or highlight results that match the personal preference profile. In certain example embodiments, thegroup recommendation system 120 generates a list of recommendations for a user based on their personal profile using a recommendation ranking algorithm. In certain example embodiments, the recommendation ranking algorithm generates a list of recommendations for the user with a score for each recommendation based on how closely the recommendation matches one or more criteria of the personal preference profile. The recommendations may be ranked or given a score value. For example, a recommendation that matches multiple criteria in a user's preference profile may be given a higher score than a recommendation that matches on a single criteria in a user's preference profile. Thesuggestion module 122 generates a personal recommendation list for each member of the social group. - At
block 410, thesuggestion module 122 calculates a composite score for each recommendation based, at least in part, on the individual rank the recommendation received in each personal recommendation list. For example, thesuggestion module 122 may identify common recommendations that occur in multiple personal recommendation lists and calculate a composite score for that recommendation. In certain example embodiments, the composite recommendation may be calculated by adding the rank or score value each recommendation list achieved on each personal recommendation list. For example, if recommendation A had a score of 10 on user A's personal recommendation list, a score of 5 on user B's personal recommendation list, and a score of 7 on user C's personal recommendation list, the composite score would be 22. In certain other example embodiments, the composite score is calculated by multiplying the scores assigned to a common recommendation on multiple personal recommendation list. - At
block 420, thesuggestion module 122 then generates a ranked group recommendation list based on at least the calculated composite score for each recommendation. For example, thesuggestion module 122 may generate a ranked recommendation list with the recommendations ranked from highest to lowest based on the composite score of each recommendation. - In an alternative example embodiment, the individual personal profiles of each member of the group are first merged into a group recommendation profile. For example, in a social group comprising group members A, B, and C, the suggestion module will merge the personal profiles of group members A, B, and C into a single group suggestion profile. The
suggestion module 122 then applies the same ranking algorithm used for individual recommendation list to generate a group recommendation list. Themethod 215 then proceeds to block 220 ofFIG. 2 . - Returning to block 220 of
FIG. 2 , thesuggestion module 122 communicates the group recommendation list to theremote computing device 110 a for display on theremote computing device 110 a. For example, the group recommendation list may be displayed to the requesting user on theremote computing device 110 a via theapplication 111. In certain example embodiments, the group recommendation list is communicated to all members of the social group via theremote computing devices 110 b, 110 c or other remote computing devices 110. In certain other example embodiments, the group recommendation list may be communicated to the other users in the social group fromremote computing device 110 a. For example, the requesting user may share the group recommendation list with other members of the social group by communicating the group recommendation list to the remote computing devices 110 associated with the other members using NFC or other suitable communication medium. -
