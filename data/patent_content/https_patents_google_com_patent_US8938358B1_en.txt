Definitions
- the present subject matter relates generally to the use of computer-based mapping systems for generating and/or receiving driving directions to requested travel destinations and, more particularly, to a system and method for suggesting alternative travel destinations to a user of a computer-based mapping system.
- Google Maps for Mobile allows mobile devices, such as smart phones, tablets, and PDAs, to display maps and directions in response to user requests.
- a user may request travel directions by inputting an origin (e.g., the user's current location) and a desired travel destination into his/her mobile device.
- the device may then receive and/or generate suggested routing information based on the origin and destination information and provide such routing information to the user, such as by mapping the suggested route onto a display screen of the device.
- a user of a computer-based mapping system desires to travel to a certain destination but actually issues a query related to a different destination. For example, a user may issue a query for a particular sports arena when in fact the user actually intends to travel to a parking lot or parking garage near the sports arena. In such instance, the user will typically request driving directions to the sports arena and thereafter deviate from the suggested route so arrive at the parking lot/garage.
- alternative travel destinations in response to queries for specific travel destinations that are more closely linked to a user's actual intent, it is believed that a more enjoyable and satisfying user experience may be obtained.
- the present subject matter is directed to a computer implemented method for suggesting alternative travel destinations.
- the method may include receiving, at a computing device, a query from a client device associated with a requested travel destination.
- the requested travel destination may be at a first geographic location.
- the method may also include analyzing travel pattern data for at least one user that previously requested travel directions to the requested travel destination to identify at least one second geographic location that is associated with the requested travel destination.
- the travel pattern data may include information associated with a location of the at least one user after requesting the travel directions.
- the method may include transmitting to the client device a suggestion for at least one alternative travel destination based on the at least one second geographic location.
- the present subject matter is directed to a system for suggesting alternative travel destinations.
- the system may include a computing device including a processor and memory.
- the memory may store instructions that, when executed by the processor, configure the computing device to receive a query from a client device associated with a requested travel destination.
- the requested travel destination may be at a first geographic location.
- the computing device may also be configured to analyze travel pattern data for at least one user that previously requested travel directions to the requested travel destination to identify at least one second geographic location that is associated with the requested travel destination.
- the travel pattern data may include information associated with a location of the at least one user after requesting the travel directions.
- the computing device may be configured to transmit to the client device a suggestion for at least one alternative travel destination based on the at least one second geographic location.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a partial map view showing both a suggested driving route for traveling between two locations and an actual travel route taken by the user that requested such driving route;
- FIG. 2 illustrates a schematic view of one embodiment of a computer-based mapping system for suggesting alternative travel destinations
- FIG. 3 illustrates a server-client flow diagram of one embodiment of a method for suggestion alternative travel destinations
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example of a user interface that may be utilized to display suggested alternative travel destinations on a client device of the user.
- travel pattern data may be collected from a plurality of users of the mapping system (e.g., using known crowdsourcing methodologies).
- the travel pattern data may include, for example, location information associated with the travel patterns of the users after requesting driving directions to a given travel destination. For instance, after receiving a request from a user for directions to a particular travel destination, data regarding the user's movement may be collected and analyzed to determine if the user actually traveled to the requested destination or to a completely different destination.
- users will often request driving directions to one destination when they actually intend to travel to a different destination.
- one or more alternative destinations may be identified as being associated with the requested travel destination. Thereafter, when another user enters a query related to the same travel destination (e.g., a search query or a query for driving directions), the identified destination(s) may be suggested to the user as a potential alternative(s) to receiving query results for the requested travel direction.
- a query related to the same travel destination e.g., a search query or a query for driving directions
- FIG. 1 illustrates a partial map view showing a suggested driving route for traveling between two locations (indicated by the solid line extending between points A and B) and an actual travel route taken by the user that requested such driving route (indicated by the circles).
- a user may request travel or driving directions by inputting an origin (e.g., the user's current location) and a travel destination into a suitable computing device (e.g., a location-enabled navigation device).
- the computing device may then receive and/or generate suggested routing information based on the origin and destination information and provide the routing information to the user (e.g., by mapping the suggested route onto a display screen of the device and/or by providing audible cues for navigating along the route).
- a suggested route may be displayed in response to a user's request for driving directions from his/her current location 10 to a nearby travel destination 12 .
- the user may then, if desired, travel along the suggested route to the requested travel destination 12 .
- this alternative destination 14 may be related to or associated with the requested travel destination 12 .
- the requested travel destination 12 may correspond to a particular attraction (e.g., a sports arena, a concert hall, a shopping mall, etc.) and the alternative destination 14 may correspond to a location for parking near the attraction (e.g., a parking lot or parking garage) or a restaurant near the attraction.
- alternative travel destinations may be identified for the requested travel destination that correlate highly to the actual travel intentions of the users.
- a user issues a query related to the same travel destination in the future (e.g., a search query or a query requesting driving directions to the destination)
- the user may be presented with one or more suggestions for alternative travel destinations based on the travel pattern data of previous users. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, when a user issues a query related to travel destination 12 , destination 14 may be suggested to the user as a potential alternative travel destination.

- a point-of-interest may be any item that is interesting to one or more users and that is associated with a geographical location.
- a point-of-interest may include a landmark, stadium, or building.
- a point-of-interest may be added to the map database 138 by professional map providers, individual users, or other entities.
- the map database 138 may also store street information.

- location information may be used to determine the travel patterns of the various users, such as the specific routes taken by users between two specified locations and the final driving destinations of the users. For example, as described above with reference to FIG.
- users may often request driving directions to a travel destination located at a first geographic location (e.g., destination 12 ) but, for a variety of reasons, may actually travel to a travel destination located at a second geographic location (e.g., destination 14 ).
- a travel destination located at a first geographic location e.g., destination 12
- a second geographic location e.g., destination 14
- travel patterns may be identified and stored with the travel pattern database 144 .
- This travel pattern data may then be utilized to suggest one or more alternative travel destinations in response to a user submitting a query related to a given travel destination.
- the travel pattern data may be stored and/or organized within the memory 134 based on a user's requested travel destination. For example, each time a user requests driving directions to a given travel destination, the location information transmitted by the user's device may be collected and stored together with the requested destination. This location information may be used to determine, among other things, when the user has reached his/her final driving destination, which may then be compared to the geographic location of the requested destination. If the geographic location of the user's final driving destination differs from the geographic location of the requested destination, such location may be identified as a potential alternative travel destination for the requested destination. As more and more users request directions to the same travel destination, a significant amount of data may be collected that reflects the actual travel patterns of users traveling to the requested destination. Thus, if the data indicates that users requesting driving directions a given travel destination often complete their journey at a different destination, such destination may be suggested to a user up-front as an alternative travel destination for the requested destination.
- FIG. 3 a client-server flow diagram of one embodiment of a method 200 for suggesting alternative travel destinations is illustrated in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter.
- the method 200 will generally be discussed herein with reference to the system 100 shown in FIG. 2 .
- the methods described herein may be executed by any computing device or any combination of computing devices.
- the methodology described herein may be performed entirely on a computing device associated with the user, such as a user's mobile device.
- the method elements 202 - 220 are shown in FIG. 3 in a specific order, the various elements of the disclosed method 200 may generally be performed in any suitable order that is consistent with the disclosure provided herein.
- the travel pattern data may be continuously analyzed to identify suitable alternative travel destinations and/or to assign quality scores to such destinations and, thus, such method elements ( 208 and 210 ) may be performed at any suitable time, including prior to and/or after receiving a suitable query from a client device.
- travel pattern data may be received within and/or stored onto a server device, such as the computing device 130 .
- a location-enabled client device e.g., computing device 110
- the server device may be configured to collect location information that provides an indication of the actual route taken by the user, as well as the final driving destination of the user.
- the actual travel patterns of users requesting driving directions to the same travel destination may be collected and stored within the server device.
- the server device may be configured to suggest alternative destinations to users requesting travel directions to a given travel destination. For instance, as shown in FIG. 3 , at 204 , a user of a client device may transmit a query to the server device related to a requested travel destination. This query may, for example, be a search query for the requested travel destination, a query for driving directions to the requested travel destination or any other suitable query.
- the server device may, at 206 , receive the user's query and, at 208 , may analyze the stored travel pattern data to identify one or more geographic locations associated with the requested travel destination.
- the server device may be configured to analyze the travel pattern data to identify the actual travel pattern(s) of a previous user(s) (including past data from the current user) that requested driving directions to the same travel destination. For example, as indicated above, the travel pattern data may allow the server device to identify the final driving destination(s) of a user(s) that previously requested driving directions to such travel destination. If the travel pattern data indicates that the user's final driving destination differed from the requested destination, the geographic location of such final driving destination may be identified as a potential alternative travel destination for the requested destination.
- the geographic location of the client device (as determined by the location information transmitted from such device) immediately prior to the navigation application being terminated and/or the device being shutdown may be assumed to be the final driving destination of the user.
- the user's navigation application may have been terminated after reaching his/her final driving destination 14 , thereby providing an indication that the user completed his/her driving journey at destination 14 instead of at the requested destination 12 .
- changes (or a lack thereof) in the travel pattern data over time may be used to estimate when a user has arrived at his/her final driving destination. For example, if the travel pattern data indicates that the user has remained at the same location for an elongated period of time, it may be determined that the user has arrived at his/her final driving destination. Similarly, the user's travel velocity may also be indicative of the user reaching his/her final driving destination. For example, if the data indicates that the user's travel velocity suddenly decreased from a speed associated with driving (e.g., greater than 5 or 10 miles per hour) to a speed associated with walking (e.g., less than 5 miles per hour), it may be assumed that the user has exited his/her vehicle. In such instance, the location at which the user's travel velocity suddenly decreased may be identified as the final driving destination for the user.
- a speed associated with driving e.g., greater than 5 or 10 miles per hour
- a speed associated with walking e.g., less than 5 miles per hour
- a geographic location(s) may also be identified as a potential alternative travel destination(s) based on its proximity to the requested travel destination (regardless of whether previous users have traveled to such geographic location(s)). For instance, in one embodiment, all businesses (e.g., restaurants, shops, etc.), potential parking areas and/or other points-of-interest (e.g., user-defined points-of-interest) located within a given distance of the requested travel destination may be identified as potential alternative travel destinations. In another embodiment, any points-of-interest that are within a given distance from the requested travel destination and that also share a common feature with or have similar characteristics to the requested travel destination may be identified as potential alternative travel destinations.
- businesses e.g., restaurants, shops, etc.
- points-of-interest e.g., user-defined points-of-interest
- a geographic location(s) may also be identified as a potential alternative travel destination(s) based on a recognized affiliation or association between the geographic location(s) and the requested travel destination.
- Such an affiliation or association may be stored on the server device and may be derived from any source that provides a link or connection between a given location and the requested travel destination.
- a business such as a hotel or restaurant, may provide recommendations or other suitable information (e.g., via its website) linking the business to geographic locations that differ from the actual geographic location of the business, such as the locations of available parking lots/garages, the locations of recommended tourists sites in the area or any other suitable locations.
- the affiliated or associated locations provided by the business may be stored on the server device and identified as potential alternative travel destinations for users requesting driving directions to such business.
- recognized affiliations or associations may also be provided directly from users of the disclosed system 100 .
- a user may be provided with the option (via a suitable user interface) to recommend or identify specific locations as potential alternative travel destinations for other users requesting travel directions to a given travel destination.
- a quality score may be assigned to each potential alternative travel destination.
- the quality score for each alternative travel destination may correspond to an assessment of the likelihood that the current user may be interested in traveling to or otherwise receiving query results for such destination as opposed to the requested travel destination.
- the quality scores may be analyzed to determine the manner in which the destination(s) are suggested to the user.
- the quality score may be based at least in part on the frequency at which users travel to the alternative travel destination.
- this frequency may be determined based on the number of instances at which users traveled to the alternative travel destination after requesting driving directions to the requested travel destination. For instance, in the example shown in FIG. 1 , the number of instances at which users traveled to destination 14 after requesting driving directions to destination 12 may be analyzed and used assign a quality score to destination 14 .
- the frequency may be determined based on the total number of instances at which users traveled to the alternative travel destination regardless of the requested travel destination. For instance, referring again to the example shown in FIG.
- destination 14 may be identified as a suitable alternative travel destination for users requesting driving directions to destinations within the area and, thus, may be scored appropriately.
- the quality score may also be user-dependent. Specifically, in several embodiments, the quality score assigned to an alternative travel destination may depend on the association or relationship of the current user (i.e., the user of the client device that transmitted the current query ( 204 )) with the user(s) from which the travel pattern data was derived in order to initially identify the alternative travel destination. For example, an alternative travel destination that has been identified based on travel pattern data derived from the current user may be scored higher (or lower depending on the user's settings) than alternative travel destinations that have been identified based on travel pattern data derived from other users.
- travel pattern data derived from users that are similar to the current user e.g., a group of users that are about the same age or that share similar interests to that of the current user) or that have some recognized relationship with the current user (e.g., users identified as “friends” of the current user) may be scored higher (or lower depending on the user's settings) than alternative travel destinations that have been identified based on travel pattern data derived from dissimilar or unrelated users.
- the quality score may also be location-dependent. Specifically, in several embodiments, the quality score assigned to an alternative travel destination may be based at least in part on the proximity of such destination to the requested travel destination. For example, alternative travel destinations that are closer to the requested travel destination may be scored higher (or lower depending on the user's settings) than alternative travel destinations that are further away from the requested travel destination.
- the quality score assigned to an alternative travel destination may also be time-dependent and/or date-dependent.
- the travel pattern data may indicate that users requesting driving directions to the requested travel destination often travel to a first alternative travel destination during certain time periods (e.g., in the morning) and to a second alternative travel destination during other time periods (e.g., at night).
- the first alternative travel destination may be scored higher (or lower depending on the user's settings) than the second alternative travel destination in the morning while the second alternative travel destination may be scored higher (or lower depending on the user's settings) than the first alternative travel destination at night.
- the travel pattern data may indicate that users requesting driving directions to the requested travel destination often travel to a first alternative travel destination on certain days (e.g., weekdays) and to a second alternative travel destination on other days (e.g., on weekends or on holidays).
- the first alternative travel destination may be score higher (or lower depending on the user's settings) than the second alternative travel destination on weekdays while the second alternative travel destination may be score higher (or lower depending on the user's settings) than the first alternative travel destination on weekends or holidays.
- the quality score may depend on whether an alternative travel destination was identified as such based on travel pattern data or on a recognized affiliation/association between the alternative travel destination and the requested travel destination. For instance, given the identified connection between the two destinations, an alternative travel destination that has been identified based on recognized affiliation/association may be scored higher (or lower depending on the user's settings) than an alternative travel destination that has been identified based solely on travel pattern data.
- the quality score may depend on user-based input selections. For instance, as will be described below with reference to FIG. 4 , a user may be provided with multiple options for alternative travel destinations displayed on a suitable user interface. Thus, in several embodiments, the user's input selection may be used as a signal or factor for determining the quality score of one or more of the alternative destinations (e.g., by scoring selected destinations higher than non-selected destinations).
- any combination of the above-described factors/criteria may be utilized to assign quality scores to the alternative travel destinations.
- each factor/criteria may be given a certain weight depending on predetermined settings and/or user-defined settings.
- a suitable machine learning technique may be implemented to determine which combination of factors/criteria should be used to most accurately assess each potential alternative travel destination.
- method elements 208 and 210 have been shown in FIG. 3 as being performed by the server device in response to receiving a query for a specific travel destination ( 206 ).
- the server device may be configured to continuously process and/or analyze the travel pattern data and, thus, may continuously update the alternative travel destination data. For instance, upon the receipt of travel pattern data, the data may be organized according to the requested travel destination and, if necessary, the list of potential alternative travel destinations for such travel destination, as well as the quality scores for such alternative destinations, may be updated based on the new travel pattern data.
- the server device may simply call-up the alternative travel destination(s) identified for such travel destination and, if necessary, adjust the quality score(s) for such alternative destination(s) based on any user-specific factors/criteria that are used in determining the quality score(s).
- the server device may suggest the potential alternative travel destination(s) to the user ( 210 ).
- the server device may be configured to transmit data associated with the alternative travel destination(s) to the client device for subsequent presentation to the user (e.g., via display 120 ( FIG. 2 )).
- the server device may be configured to transmit the alternative travel destination suggestions(s) to the client device based on the quality score(s) assigned to the destination(s). For example, in one embodiment, the server device may be configured to only transmit suggestions for alternative travel destinations that have been assigned a quality score above a predetermined threshold.
- the server device may be configured to transmit the suggestions for alternative travel destinations in a particular order or in specific categories based on their quality scores.
- the server device may simply be configured to transmit the alternative travel destinations to the client device along with their corresponding quality scores so that the client device may subsequently filter, sort and/or otherwise process the suggestions based on their scores.
- the alternative travel destination suggestion(s) transmitted by the server device may be received by the client device and subsequently presented to the user.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example user interface 300 that may be utilized to display the alternative travel destination suggestions on a client device of the user (e.g., computing device 110 ).
- a plurality of alternative travel destinations may be presented to the user in the form of selectable interface elements 302 (e.g., with the elements 302 ordered randomly or according to their quality scores).
- selectable interface element 304 may also be presented to allow the user to confirm that he/she would like to receive the query results for the previously requested travel destination.
- the client device may, at 216 , transmit a query related to the selected destination. Additionally, at 218 and 220 , the server device may receive the query and subsequently generate appropriate query results. For example, if the query transmitted by the client device requests driving directions to the selected alternative travel destination, the server device may generate a driving route for traveling from the user's current location (or from another point or origin) to the selected alternative travel destination. Thereafter, the routing information may be transmitted to the user's client device and presented to the user. Alternatively, in embodiments in which the client device is configured to generate its own driving route, the route may be generated by the client device upon selection by the user of one of the alternative travel destinations.
