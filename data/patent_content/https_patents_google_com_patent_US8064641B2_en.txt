- FIG. 3 shows how various inputs are collected and processed.
- the context fusion processor 220 may use these inputs, together with additional data from the databases, to determine the identity of an unknown object in the video clip.
- a determination of the identity of an unknown object may be performed as the following. For every input i, i being input number 1, 2, 3 . . . N, a distance to each reference object D i is obtained and weight w i is assigned to the input based on the historical data received from the history DB 242 .
- C i 1/(a i +b i ⁇ D i 2 ), where a i +b i are constants chosen based on historically performed recognitions of unknown objects.
- D i may be a distance between vectors of the unknown object and a reference object.
- D i may be an edit distance extracted as Levenstein distance.
- D i may be a distance showing the unknown object resemblance to the reference objects in the reference database.
- D i in some example embodiments, may be a distance indicating voice resemblance to the reference person in the database.
- the decision may be made on whether the unknown object is identified as a reference object by comparing the joint distance function value with some threshold learned from the historical recognitions. If the distance value for some reference object is less than the threshold, then the unknown object is identified as this reference object. If there is more than one reference object for which joint distance is less than threshold, then the reference object with the least distance value is chosen.
- inputs are combined linearly with the weights. However, it will be noted that other joint distance derivation may be used. For example, non-linear combinations of the inputs with weights may be utilized. For example, instead of the partial confidences C i , true conditional probabilities may be utilized i . Any other types of distance to confidence transformation may be utilized.
- the context fusion processor 220 may create indexed records of identified objects and store the indexed records to the index DB 240 .
- FIG. 4 Various example components of the context fusion processor 220 are shown in FIG. 4 .
- the context fusion processor 220 may comprise a receiving module 202 , an associating module 204 , a computing module 206 , a comparing module 208 , an identification module 210 , an indexing module 212 , and other modules 214 .
- Various operations performed by the context fusion processor 220 are described by a way of example with reference to an example method 500 of FIG. 5 .
- FIG. 5 shows a method 500 for processing digital media, in accordance with one example embodiment.
- the method 500 may be performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (e.g., dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, etc.), software (such as may be run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both.
- the processing logic resides at the digital media processor 200 illustrated in FIG. 2 .
- the method 500 may be performed by the various modules discussed above with reference to FIG. 4 . These modules may comprise processing logic.
- each input received from a context extraction processor may be a distance between an unknown object detected by the facial context extraction processor 224 and a suggested reference object selected among the reference objects of the persons DB 238 .
- the digital media inputs utilized by the extraction possessors to produce inputs to be received by the receiving module 202 may comprise facial images detected in a video frame, an EPG, a television channel identifier, sub-titles accompanying a video stream, optical character recognition data, human voices detected in the audio accompanying the video, textual data derived from the accompanying audio, and a transcript of the audio derived from the video stream.
- the suggestions received from various context extraction processors by the receiving module 202 may represent distances between the unknown object and the reference objects.
- Multiple suggestions received from a single context extraction processor may indicate that multiple reference objects look similar to the unknown object.
- there may be more than one suggestion received from a single context extraction processor because more than one reference object may be determined to be within a certain threshold distance of the unknown object.
- only the shortest distance between the reference object and the unknown object is received from a single context extraction processor.
- the input distances to reference objects received from the context extraction processors are expressed as a norm of vectors difference in a non-Euclidean coordinate system.
- each input received by the receiving module 202 may represent a distance between the unknown object and a reference object, where the likelihood of the correct identification may become greater as the distance gets smaller.
- the distance may be of different kind.
- the distance received from the facial context extraction processor 224 represents the distance between the unknown facial image and the reference facial image.
- the distance received from the audio context extraction processor 232 represents the difference between the voice of the unknown object and the known reference object.
- the distance received from the names extraction processor 230 represents the distance between the name of the unknown object and the name of the known reference object.
- the receiving module 202 may receive relative weights to be associated with the inputs received at operation 502 .
- the relative weights may represent likelihoods that the distances between the reference objects and the unknown objects have been correctly determined.
- the weights may be based on the historical probabilities of correct identification obtained from the history DB 242 , shown in FIG. 3 . Utilization of the historical data may imply that a part of a processed video stream is manually verified to fill in the history DB 242 and derive historical probabilities.
- a context extraction processor may correctly determine the distance between the reference object and the unknown object to be the smallest in 90% of identification attempts. In such 90% of the identification cases, the reference object may subsequently be determined to be the unknown object.
- the weight associated with such a suggestion may be higher than the weight associated with the input that has only been correct in 30% of the historical cases.
- Historical probability of an object or person's appearance in a given category of video may be used to determine the likelihood of the unknown object to appear in the video.
- the more frequently a person appears in the video the more probable it is that any object or face detected in the video is of that person and, accordingly, the weight associated with such person may be increased.
- the weights of the inputs may be determined by the corresponding extraction processors based on how many other possible reference objects are within the threshold distance of the unknown object. As an example, if an extraction processor has three possible matches within a certain threshold distance of each other, the weight assigned to the input may be smaller because the likelihood of an error is higher. Since the inputs are not homogeneous and may be based on analyses of a video frame, accompanying audio, subtitles, and other digital media, the weights assigned to each input based on the historical data may not directly correlate with the percentage of previous correct identifications.
- the relative weights associated with the inputs there may be additional factors affecting the relative weights associated with the inputs. Such factors may include whether or not the reference objects and the unknown object are being seen on the same TV set, same TV channel, same news channel, and the same web broadcast. Other factors may include a category of the video clip comprising social life, sports, politics, fashion, show business, finance, and stock market. Information regarding the category of the video clip may be derived from the EPG, a video transcript, or be previously learned. A locale of the context of the video may also affect the relative weights of the inputs. As an example, if a video has been filmed in France, then it is more likely that a French national is appearing in the video rather than a national of a different country.
- the relative weights received by receiving module 202 may be associated with their respective inputs by the associating module 204 , shown in FIG. 4 .
- the weight of each input may be normalized so that the sum of the weights received by the receiving module 202 is equal to the unit weight (e.g., 1).
- the inputs and their associated weights may be utilized by the context fusion processor 220 to determine the distance between the reference objects and unknown object based on the inputs and their weights received by the receiving module 202 of FIG. 4 .
- a weight function may be utilized to determine the distance.
- the computing module 206 may utilize the weight function to compute the distance between the unknown object and the reference objects from the persons DB 238 , shown in FIG. 3 .
- the weight function may be utilized to perform a sum, integral, or average operation in order to give some elements more of a “weight” than others.
- the distance weight value may be calculated for a different set of the reference objects.
- the value of the joint distance function may be computed for every reference object in the persons DB 238 .
- the value of the joint distance function representing the distance between the unknown object and a reference object from the persons DB 238 may be computed by the computing module 206 , shown in FIG. 4 , based on the inputs and their relative weights.
- Constants a x and b x may be learned from historical data stored in the history DB 242 .
- the inputs received from the context extraction processors represent distances between the unknown object and the reference objects from the persons DB 238 .
- the comparing module 208 may be utilized to compare the values of the joint distance function computed by the computing module 206 to the predetermined threshold values. Because the values of the joint distance function are distances between the unknown object and the reference objects, the predetermined threshold values are set to ensure that the computed distances are within a certain range. Accordingly, the facial image may be assumed to be correctly identified when the value of the joint distance function is the smallest of the distances calculated for the reference facial images set and is smaller than a threshold value.
- the facial image of the unknown person may be represented by a point in some mathematical space and the value of the joint distance function may represent the radius of a sphere in that space. If the point representing the facial image of the reference image is within the sphere, the facial image of the unknown person and the facial image of the reference person may be assumed to be associated with the same person.
- the distances between the unknown object and the reference objects may be calculated for each reference person in the persons DB 238 .
- the metadata stored in the persons DB 238 along with the reference objects may include the name of the person associated with the reference object and the person's occupations or professions.
- the metadata may result in an increase of the relative weight assigned to the input if the video feed and the person's occupation correspond thematically.
- Information regarding the theme of the video feed may be extracted from the EPG. In some example embodiments, frequent appearances of the person in the videos with a certain theme may increase the relative weight associated with the input.
- the identification module 210 may make an identification of the unknown object.
- the unknown object in some example embodiments, may be a facial image.
- the reference object and the unknown object may be correctly identified as the same object, but the metadata may be assigned to the reference object in the persons DB 238 that is incorrect. Accordingly, an incorrect identification may result, and at operation 512 , the persons DB 238 may be corrected or updated manually by performing a visual check.
- an operator performing a visual check may utilize his prior knowledge to determine that the reference object is not correctly labelled and update the persons DB 238 .
- the fusion parameters 244 may be tuned in order to more correctly represent the likelihood of each context extraction input predicting the identity of the unknown object. Such determination may be based on the identification made at operation 512 . At operation 522 , it may be determined whether or not there is a high likelihood of correct identification made at operation 512 . If, for example, the identification is made based on relative weights received from previously utilized fusion parameters, a process may be run against the history DB 242 , shown in FIG. 3 , to determine whether the relative weights associated with the inputs correlate to the historical identifications.
- the relative weights may be readjusted based on the historical identifications at operations 524 and 516 and re-associated with the inputs at operation 506 .
- a distance function weight value may be obtained again based on the new relative weights at operation 508 and the process of the comparing and the identification repeated at operations 510 and 512 .
- the indexing module 212 may create an index file or add new index data to an existing index file. For each frame in the input video stream, a corresponding record may be created in the index file having a record identifier, the identity of the object, the spatial position of the object in the frame, and the time of appearance of the object in the video.
- the data indexed at operation 518 may consequently be used to permit users to search videos for objects by name and allow users to view videos exactly from the moment when the object appeared in the video stream.
- Other modules 214 shown in FIG. 4 , may be used to facilitate operations of the context fusion processor 220 . Various operations performed by the facial context extraction processor 224 are described by way of example with reference to FIG. 6 .
- FIG. 6 illustrates a method 600 for object extraction and storing, in accordance with an example embodiment.
- the method 600 may be performed by the various modules discussed above with reference to FIG. 2 .
- the method 600 may commence at operation 602 with detecting a scene change in a frame received from the buffered frame sequence processor 222 .
- the object to be identified may be located in the frame.
- the object detection may not be initially performed on each frame. Instead the object, such as a facial image, may be detected in the first and the last frame of the buffered part of the input video stream and the likely locations of the object approximated across the frames located between the first and last frames of every buffer. Regions that are less likely to contain the objects may be excluded from further detection to increase performance.
- the frame may be queued for OCR (optical character recognition) processing if an object is present in the frame.
- OCR optical character recognition
- the OCR content extraction processor 226 may be subsequently utilized to process the textual context of the frame.
- the OCR processing is described in more detail with reference to FIG. 7 of the drawings below.
- eyes may be detected in the frames where a facial image was already detected.
- the eye detection may be implemented by detection of eye pupil centers by any of a number of known methods.
- the eye detection may be utilized in normalizing the facial image.
- AdaBoost Adaptive Boosting
- AdaBoost Adaptive Boosting
- Other face detection methods may be based on direct detection of eye pupils.
- a determination may be made to preserve the frames if the distance between the eyes is greater than a threshold distance. For example, the faces with the distance between eyes of less than 40 pixels may be suppressed and not used when identifying the object.
- the facial images previously detected at operation 610 are normalized to be in a horizontal orientation, for light intensity, and by size so that the coordinates of the eye centers in the facial image have certain fixed values.
- the facial mages normalized at operation 612 may be clustered in a cluster cache.
- Each facial image is added to an existing facial image if the facial image is identified as similar to an existing facial image. Such identification may mean that a cluster for this object has been previously created. Every face in a cluster may have an associated presence rate, representing how many images similar to the face are detected in the video stream.
- To determine whether the facial image represents an object from a previously detected cluster the distance between the current facial image and the previous facial images is measured. If the distance is below a predetermined threshold, the facial image may be assumed to represent a person for whom a cluster has already been created.
- the distance is below a predetermined threshold, there may be no additional value in saving an almost identical facial image, and, correspondingly, the facial image may be dropped. If, on the other hand, the difference between the facial images in the previously created clusters and the newly normalized facial image is greater than a predetermined threshold, the image may belong to a different unknown object, and accordingly, a new cluster may be started. In some example embodiments, there may be more than one cluster created for the same unknown object.
- the cluster caches created at operation 614 may be labeled with a list of probable objects and confidence levels that correspond to each probable object identified as such from the normalized facial images. The identification of the normalized facial images is based on a calculation of distances of the unknown object to every reference image from the persons DB 238 . Clusters with overall presence rated below a certain threshold may be discarded and not used in further processing.
- the cluster caches created at operation 614 may be saved to the cluster DB 236 along with labels, face sizes, and screenshots.
- the facial context extraction processor 224 may save textual context extracted from the input video stream for subsequent processing by the optical character recognition content extraction processor 226 . Because such textual context may contain names of the persons appearing in the input video stream, it may be helpful in the identification of such persons.
- Various operations performed by the optical character recognition content extraction processor 226 are described by way of example with reference to an example method 700 of FIG. 7 .
- FIG. 7 illustrates a method for identifying text blocks associated with face objects within an image for optical character recognition of relevant text, in accordance with an example embodiment.
- the method 700 may be performed by the various modules discussed above with reference to FIG. 2 . These modules may comprise processing logic.
- a text block may be detected in a frame saved for OCR by operation 606 as described above with reference to FIG. 6 of the drawings.
- frame blocks may be selected based on probable name locations within the textual content.
- the probable names may be subsequently determined by using an edit distance method to measure a number of transformations it may take to change a word into a name, thus determining the likelihood of the textual content to include names (e.g., Levenstein method), as mentioned above with reference to FIG. 2 of the drawings.
- the optical character recognition content extraction processor 226 may process text blocks, find caption patterns template at operation 708 , classify OCR output at operation 710 , and create raw OCR context at operation 712 .
- the raw OCR context created at operation 712 may be processed by the names extraction processor 230 to extract names from the raw OCR context.
- Various operations performed by the names extraction processor 230 are described by way of example with reference to an example method 800 of FIG. 8 .
- FIG. 8 illustrates a method for identifying names associated with an object in a video clip, in accordance with an example embodiment.
- the method 800 may be performed by the various modules discussed above with reference to FIG. 2 . These modules may comprise processing logic. As shown in FIG. 8 , the method 800 commences at operation 802 with speech-to-text recognition technology being used to translate audio received from the audio context extraction processor 232 into text. At operation 804 , the textual context received from the optical character recognition content extraction processor 226 and the text-based context creation processor 228 is used, along with the text recognized at operation 802 , to extract names. The names extracted at operation 804 are made available to be utilized by the context fusion processor 220 when making the identification of the unknown object.
- FIG. 9 shows a diagrammatic representation of a machine in the example electronic form of a computer system 900 , within which a set of instructions for causing the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein may be executed.
- the machine operates as a standalone device or may be connected (e.g., networked) to other machines.
