- the inventive field relates to advertising in conjunction with publication of publishers Web content.
- the application relates to improving the relevance of advertisements and other virtual content in publisher documents, with respect to inferred locus for advertisers ads and inferred locus for the publishers Web content.
- Some websites provide an information search functionality that is based on query keywords entered by the user seeking information. This user query can be used as an indicator of the type of information of interest to the user. By comparing the user query to a list of keywords specified by an advertiser, it is possible to provide relevant advertisements to these search service users.
- a publisher's Web content may not include information search functionality, but may include links to Web pages or other documents. Also, a publisher's Web content may incorporate advertisements in order to generate a source of revenue, as well as to enhance the value of their Web site.
- Publishers may be concerned with proliferation of advertisements in their Web sites that do not enhance the value of their Web sites, but instead may be annoying to visitors browsing their Web sites. Publishers may wish to limit their Web sites to advertisements that enhance the visitors experience and motivation for visiting their site. For example, a publisher Web site that provides information about Big Sur would have its value enhanced by including advertisements about local outfitters in the publisher's Web pages.
- facilities may be provided that enable advertisers to include keywords and parameters. Advertisers can provide keywords that would help their ads to be matched by search terms entered by a potential consumer. In addition, advertisers can provide preferred geographic location information so that potential consumers will be provided advertisements that pertain to a location of interest.
- advertisements for a specific location area can be provided to users that are relevant to the location of the user.
- keywords and parameters such as location information by advertisers are voluntary, and may not be entered by an advertiser in creating an ad.
- publishers may not show a specific address, but may publish content that relates to a geographic area.
- an aspect is to infer a geographic locus for a publisher Web site, document or application, and a geographic locus associated with advertiser Web sites, and match potential advertisers with the publisher Web site based on geographic locus information inferred for the publisher Web site and inferred for advertisers landing pages.
- a method and apparatus including a virtual content analysis and selection component inferring a geographic locus for landing pages based on information indicating a geographic location encoded in the respective landing page, and a publisher document analyzer inferring a geographic locus for the publisher document based on information indicating a geographic location encoded in the publisher document.
- the virtual content analysis and selection component selecting one or more ads based on corresponding landing pages having inferred geographic locus that match the inferred geographic locus for the publisher document.
- An ad interface component that serves the selected ads.
- a publisher's document can provide important hints on the location of the publisher or the location about which the document is written. Advertisers may not have specified a location of their business, but corresponding landing pages may provide information that indicates a possible location. By extracting information on the location of the publisher and location information from landing pages, geographic locus of a publisher and geographic locus of landing pages can be inferred. This enables content ads which pertain to a geographic locus in proximity of the publisher location to be served.

- step 308 a geographic location is inferred for all pages that have been analyzed. If other addresses are incorporated in other pages of the advertiser Web site, a determination can be made as to which address is the most common. The most common address is qualified as a geographic location for the landing page. If only one address is incorporated in multiple pages of the advertiser Web site, the address is identified as being unambiguous. The unambiguous address is qualified as a geographic location associated with the landing page.
- the inferred geographic location is provided as a geographic locus of a Web site for an advertiser, an ad agency, or hosting service that is serving as a proxy for the advertiser, and is stored as an address for an ad in the ad database 120 .
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart for determining an inferred geographic locus for a publisher page, document, or application based on pages or documents in a publisher Web site.
- a geographic locus for the publisher Web page can be inferred in a manner similar to the analysis performed for landing pages.
- the publisher page analysis component 250 determines if any city names, major landmarks, street names, are incorporated that would indicate a geographic locus. If there are multiple city names, major landmarks or street names, a geographic locus for the publisher Web page may be inferred and in step 404 , qualified as a potential geographic locus.
- step 406 steps may be repeated for other publisher Web pages or documents.
- step 408 the inferred geographic locus is provided as a geographic locus of a publisher page, document or application.
- step 410 the inferred locus can be annotated to a publisher page, document or application stored in the publisher database 130 .
- Landing pages and other pages associated with a businesses Web site may contain an explicit structured address. Businesses that provide a structured address can be considered as a “local business.” In contrast, a Web site that does not provide an address may be directed to a regional, national or international audience, or otherwise has no locality information contained within its pages, and as such is not a “local business.” Publisher pages, documents or applications may be for a specific region, and may also contain an explicit structured address.

- step 510 a determination is made as to whether the landing page is for a local business, i.e., incorporates an explicit address.
- step 510 when the landing page is determined to be for a local business, in step 520 the ad analysis and selection component 220 extracts the address and/or phone number and in step 530 , the address is qualified as a potential geographic location associated with the landing page.
- the landing page incorporates a phone number, but not an address, an address can be obtained by reverse lookup on the phone number.
- step 540 is performed in the ad analysis and selection component 220 .
- the page is analyzed for information that indicates a geographic location.
- the landing page can be analyzed for words or phrases that indicate city names, major landmarks, or street names. City names, major landmarks, or street names may be extracted based on terms maintained in the geo-location database 135 .
- step 550 the geographic location of the landing page is determined based on the extracted location information and the landing page is tagged (annotated) as a local landing page.
- step 560 other pages are followed using the advertiser server 140 and analyzed beginning at step 510 in a similar manner in the ad analysis and selection component 220 . Further links from the landing page may be followed to other pages of the advertiser Web site. The other pages may be tagged (annotated) as being a local page.
- a geographic location is inferred for all pages that have been tagged. If other addresses are incorporated in other pages of the advertiser Web site, a determination can be made as to which address is the most common. The most common address is qualified as a geographic location for the landing page. If only one address is incorporated in multiple pages of the advertiser Web site, the address is identified as being unambiguous. The unambiguous address is qualified as a geographic location associated with the landing page.

Abstract
An apparatus and method for inferring a geographic locus for a publisher document in order to obtain advertisements that are relevant to the inferred geographic locus. Landing pages are analyzed by determining whether the page encodes a street address and extract the street address or for information that is indicative of a geographic locus and thereby determine the geographic locus of the page. The ad server can infer a geographic locus for the publisher document based on information indicating a geographic location encoded in the publisher document, and select ads based on corresponding landing pages having inferred geographic locus that match the inferred geographic locus for the publisher document.
Description
- 1. Technical Field
- The inventive field relates to advertising in conjunction with publication of publishers Web content. In particular, the application relates to improving the relevance of advertisements and other virtual content in publisher documents, with respect to inferred locus for advertisers ads and inferred locus for the publishers Web content.
- 2. Background
- Some websites provide an information search functionality that is based on query keywords entered by the user seeking information. This user query can be used as an indicator of the type of information of interest to the user. By comparing the user query to a list of keywords specified by an advertiser, it is possible to provide relevant advertisements to these search service users.
- A publisher's Web content may not include information search functionality, but may include links to Web pages or other documents. Also, a publisher's Web content may incorporate advertisements in order to generate a source of revenue, as well as to enhance the value of their Web site.
- However, selecting advertisers that may enhance value for the publishers Web site can be fairly complicated. Also, publisher documents have limited display resources, and there may be other advertisers that would be more relevant and produce better value enhancement to a publisher's Web site.
- Publishers, on the other hand, may be concerned with proliferation of advertisements in their Web sites that do not enhance the value of their Web sites, but instead may be annoying to visitors browsing their Web sites. Publishers may wish to limit their Web sites to advertisements that enhance the visitors experience and motivation for visiting their site. For example, a publisher Web site that provides information about Big Sur would have its value enhanced by including advertisements about local outfitters in the publisher's Web pages.
- In order to assist advertisers in producing online ads, facilities may be provided that enable advertisers to include keywords and parameters. Advertisers can provide keywords that would help their ads to be matched by search terms entered by a potential consumer. In addition, advertisers can provide preferred geographic location information so that potential consumers will be provided advertisements that pertain to a location of interest.
- Provided an ad database that contains geographic location information, advertisements for a specific location area can be provided to users that are relevant to the location of the user.
- However, entry of keywords and parameters such as location information by advertisers is voluntary, and may not be entered by an advertiser in creating an ad. In addition, publishers may not show a specific address, but may publish content that relates to a geographic area.
- In order to expand the pool of potential advertisers that may be relevant to a publisher, an aspect is to infer a geographic locus for a publisher Web site, document or application, and a geographic locus associated with advertiser Web sites, and match potential advertisers with the publisher Web site based on geographic locus information inferred for the publisher Web site and inferred for advertisers landing pages.
- A method and apparatus including a virtual content analysis and selection component inferring a geographic locus for landing pages based on information indicating a geographic location encoded in the respective landing page, and a publisher document analyzer inferring a geographic locus for the publisher document based on information indicating a geographic location encoded in the publisher document. The virtual content analysis and selection component selecting one or more ads based on corresponding landing pages having inferred geographic locus that match the inferred geographic locus for the publisher document. An ad interface component that serves the selected ads.
- A publisher's document can provide important hints on the location of the publisher or the location about which the document is written. Advertisers may not have specified a location of their business, but corresponding landing pages may provide information that indicates a possible location. By extracting information on the location of the publisher and location information from landing pages, geographic locus of a publisher and geographic locus of landing pages can be inferred. This enables content ads which pertain to a geographic locus in proximity of the publisher location to be served.
- These and other aspects are described in detail with respect to the drawings.
- The teachings of the present invention can be readily understood by considering the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. In the drawings,

One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.
- The following description refers to the accompanying drawings. The following description is not intended to limit the scope. Instead, the scope is defined by the appended claims.
- In an example embodiment, a database of ads, or other virtual content submitted by advertisers, and a database of publisher Web site information and content can be maintained in a database system. Advertisers can be provided with an interface for creating and/or updating ads or other virtual content for storage in the ad database. Publishers can incorporate code in their Web pages, documents or applications that can retrieve ads from the ad database. The selection of ads and virtual content to be retrieved can be made by a virtual content selector. Publisher data can be obtained by a crawler that analyzes a Publisher Web site, documents or application and extracts content, information about content and geographic locus information. Landing pages associated with the database of ads can be analyzed in order to extract geographic location information for the landing pages.

FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an example network environment which embodiments may be implemented. Implementations of the network environment can include a computing system that includes a back end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), e.g., the Internet, or cellular network. - The network environment in
FIG. 1 includes anad server 110, anadvertiser server 140, apublisher server 150, andvarious user devices 160, which communicate overnetwork 170. The ad server is in communication with a back-end database system, including anad database system 120, apublisher database system 130, and a geo-location database system 135. Other database systems which are not shown may also be included, including a performance database system. Although only asingle advertiser server 140 and asingle publisher server 150 are shown for purposes of simplicity of illustration, it is understood that more than one such server may be provided. Also,publisher server 150 may be accessed through communication withuser devices 160 of publishers, and anadvertiser server 140 may be accessed though communication withuser devices 160 of advertisers. - It is understood that advertisers may also be agencies for advertisers, and that publishers may also be developers of Web sites for publishers. In addition, advertisers may have landing pages that may also be publisher Web pages or a publisher Web site. In other words, it is possible to have online ads or at least links for the publisher Web site itself.
- For purposes of this disclosure, an advertiser may be a party that directly or indirectly sells the goods or services being advertised. The advertisement (“online ad”) may exist in a variety of forms ranging from text, image, audio, audio/visual, or any other type of sensory message. Also, advertisers may distribute other virtual content, in addition to or as an alternative to ads.
- The
advertiser server 140 may be accessed by both the advertiser through auser device 160 and an advertisement consumer, such as a publisher. A publisher may access apublisher server 150 to incorporate online ads into a page of a publisher Web site. The online ads may be related to landing pages hosted by the advertisement server. Publisher Web pages may be provided to a user through thenetwork 170 by way of auser device 160 using a Web browser, document or application. - As shown in
FIG. 2 , thead server 110 may include an ad entry andmanagement interface 210. An advertiser can use the ad entry andmanagement interface 210 to enter one or more ad creatives (otherwise known as “ads” or “advertisements”), one or more keywords associated with the creatives, geographic location information (such as a country, city, address, that represents a region of interest an online ad), and other information related to the online ad. Data entered and maintained for ad creatives are stored in thead database system 120. Thead database system 120 may be any of a variety of data storage and retrieval systems, such as a relational database system, flat file system, extensible markup language (XML) files, as well as other data management tools, such as tools for handling big data. - The
ad server 110 also includes an ad analysis andselection component 220.FIG. 6 shows a schematic for an example of an electronic display of a publisher page or document 600. As shown inFIG. 6 , the publisher page or document 600 may contain publisher content 610 alink 640 to anexternal Web page 650. For purposes of this disclosure, a link is a hypertext link, which when activated, retrieves a Web page addressed by the hyperlink. - The ad analysis and
selection component 220 can access landing pages from theads database 120. For landing pages that are for local businesses (i.e., businesses that have an explicit address that mention formal addresses, identified by a label “address” or in the form of an address, such as street, city, zipcode), the ad analysis andselection component 220 can extract the addresses and phone numbers. The ad analysis andselection component 220 can apply a weighting to extracted addresses. For example, address information that is repeated a number of times in a landing page can be given greater weight. When a landing page contains only one address that is repeated more than once, that address would be given greater weight than when a landing page contains a repeated address, but also contains at least one other address. On the other end of weighting, when multiple addresses are contained in a landing page, and the multiple addresses are in different regions, states, even countries, which would indicate large distances between addresses, the address information is given a relatively low weight. The ad analysis andselection component 220 can access other pages of an Advertiser's Web site fromadvertiser server 140. When the other pages are associated with the landing page, address information can be extracted from those other pages of the advertiser Web site. When the same address is mentioned on multiple pages, the same address is labeled as “non-ambiguous.” - For the Advertiser's Web pages that do not mention specific addresses and phone numbers, the ad analysis and
selection component 220 can extract city names, names of major landmarks, and street names. For purposes of identifying city names, names of major landmarks, and street names, geo-location database 135 can be accessed. If a page mentions any of a city name, name of a landmark, street name, more than once, the page will be marked as being a local page. - The ad analysis and
selection component 220 can tag (i.e., annotate) those local landing pages that have geographic location information extracted. Upon extracting geographic location information from pages, an inferred location for a landing page will be determined among all of the local pages of an Advertiser's Web site. - The
ad server 110 further includes apublisher page analyzer 250. Thepublisher page analyzer 250 analyzes the publisher pages at the publisher Web site by extracting any explicitly mentioned addresses and phone numbers, and by searching for possible location information, such as city names, major landmarks, street names.FIG. 6 shows an example publisher Web page, document or application 600 in whichcontent 610 may include an address/phone number 612 or landmark name 614. Thepublisher page analyzer 250 can determine a geographic locus for a page, document or application in the publisher page Web site. Analysis of a publisher Web site can be performed using data maintained in thepublisher database system 130. For example, thepublisher database system 130 can contain cached pages or documents from a publisher Web site. - Analysis of advertiser landing pages and other pages in an advertiser Web site by the ad analysis and
selection component 220, and analysis of publisher pages or documents in a publisher Web site by the publisherpage analysis component 250 can be performed using data obtained by a crawler. A crawler may periodically crawl a publisher Web site or advertiser Web site for updated information that may be used to populate thepublisher database 130 orads database 120, respectively. - Online ads stored in the
ad database 120 can be retrieved by the ad analysis andselection component 220 based on criteria that the advertisers had chosen geo-targeting for the advertiser's inferred location. In addition, other online ads can be retrieved based on criteria that an inferred geographic location of landing pages match the inferred geographic location for the publisher document. - An ad ordering and ranking
component 230 can rank online ads taking into account their proximity to the publisher inferred location. Thead consumer interface 240 can further evaluate the one or more ranked online ads from the ad ordering and rankingcomponent 230 in order to provide an ad consumer such as a publisher with Web site relevant ads in accordance with a request from a publisher Web page for an automatically inserted ad.FIG. 7 shows a schematic for a publisher Web page or document 600 in which an embedded request for an ad A2 760 results in insertion of an ad A2. The inserted ad A2 may have a link to a landing page A2 770. Also shown inFIG. 7 is a request for an ad that has resulted in insertion of an ad A3 780 that has been retrieved by taking into consideration proximity to the inferred geographic locus for the publisher Web page, document or application. - “Geographic location information” may include information specifying one or more of one or more countries, one or more (inter-country) regions, one or more states, one or more metro areas, one or more cities, one or more towns, one or more boroughs, one or more areas with common zip codes, one or more areas with common telephone area codes, one or more areas served by common cable head end stations, one or more areas served by common network access points or nodes, one or more geographic areas defined by some other means, etc. It may include latitude and/or longitude, or a range thereof. Thus, for example, it may be or include an area defined by a geographic reference point and perhaps some additional information, such as a circular area of a defined radius about a point defined by latitude and longitude coordinates for example. As another example, it may be an area defined by three or more geographic reference points, such as a triangle, rectangle, pentagon, or some other polygon defined by a number of geographic reference points for example. It may also include information, such as an IP address, from which a location can be estimated.
- A “Web browser” is a browser facility (such as the Google Chrome™ browser form Google Inc., the Internet Explorer™ browser from Microsoft, the Mozilla Firefox™ browser of the Mozilla Foundation, the Navigator™ browser from AOL/Time Warner, the Opera™ Web browser from Opera Software of Norway, etc.) capable of interpreting and displaying Web pages from an underlying page source code.
- A “document” is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product. A document may be a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, etc. The files may be of any type, such as text, audio, image, video, etc. Parts of a document to be rendered to an end user are “content” of the document. A document may include “structured data” containing both content (words, pictures, etc.) and some indication of the meaning of that content (for example, e-mail fields and associated data, XML tags and associated data, etc.). Ad spots in the document may be defined by embedded information or instructions. In the context of the Internet, a common document is a Web page. Web pages often include content and may include embedded information (such as meta information, hyperlinks, etc.) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript™, etc.). In many cases, a document has a unique, addressable, storage location and can therefore be uniquely identified by this addressable location. A universal resource locator (URL), for example, is a unique address used to access information on the Internet.
- “Content” from a document may be rendered on a “content rendering application or device”. Examples of content rendering applications include a Web browser, a media player (e.g., an MP3 player, a Realnetworks streaming audio file player, etc.), a viewer (e.g., an Abobe Acrobat™ pdf reader), etc.
- Advertisers can use the ad campaign entry/
management interface 210 to enter an address for their business or service, or a geographic locus that they wish to target. Entry of a geographic location or address is optional. For those ads, or other virtual content, stored in thead database 120, thead server 110 can infer a location for ads, based on information extracted from an associated landing page, as well as other pages for the Web site associated with the landing page. -
FIG. 3 shows a flowchart for an example process of inferring a geographic locus of an ad in thead database 120. Instep 302, the page is analyzed for information that indicates a geographic location. The landing page can be analyzed for words or phrases that indicate city names, major landmarks, or street names. City names, major landmarks, or street names may be extracted based on terms maintained in the geo-location database 135. Instep 304, the geographic location of the landing page is determined based on the extracted location information. - In
step 306, other pages are followed using theadvertiser server 140 and analyzed beginning atstep 302 in a similar manner in the ad analysis andselection component 220. Further links from the landing page may be followed to other pages of the advertiser Web site. Instep 308, a geographic location is inferred for all pages that have been analyzed. If other addresses are incorporated in other pages of the advertiser Web site, a determination can be made as to which address is the most common. The most common address is qualified as a geographic location for the landing page. If only one address is incorporated in multiple pages of the advertiser Web site, the address is identified as being unambiguous. The unambiguous address is qualified as a geographic location associated with the landing page. - In
step 310, the inferred geographic location is provided as a geographic locus of a Web site for an advertiser, an ad agency, or hosting service that is serving as a proxy for the advertiser, and is stored as an address for an ad in thead database 120. -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart for determining an inferred geographic locus for a publisher page, document, or application based on pages or documents in a publisher Web site. A geographic locus for the publisher Web page can be inferred in a manner similar to the analysis performed for landing pages. Instep 402, the publisherpage analysis component 250 determines if any city names, major landmarks, street names, are incorporated that would indicate a geographic locus. If there are multiple city names, major landmarks or street names, a geographic locus for the publisher Web page may be inferred and instep 404, qualified as a potential geographic locus. - In
step 406, steps may be repeated for other publisher Web pages or documents. Instep 408, the inferred geographic locus is provided as a geographic locus of a publisher page, document or application. Instep 410, the inferred locus can be annotated to a publisher page, document or application stored in thepublisher database 130. - Landing pages and other pages associated with a businesses Web site may contain an explicit structured address. Businesses that provide a structured address can be considered as a “local business.” In contrast, a Web site that does not provide an address may be directed to a regional, national or international audience, or otherwise has no locality information contained within its pages, and as such is not a “local business.” Publisher pages, documents or applications may be for a specific region, and may also contain an explicit structured address.
-
FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method for analyzing pages of an advertiser Web site that are for a business, product or service including cases where a advertiser is a local business. Inferred locations are annotated to the landing page of the ad. - The
ad server 110 can analyze landing pages. A landing page for a local business is identified in thead database 120 by an explicit address. An example of an explicit structured address is one that contains a label “address” or “location” followed by a standard expression for an address, such as street, city, state, and zip code. International addresses may vary in format. Alternatively, a landing page may contain an explicit address that is in a standard format for an address, but without a formal label. A phone number having a local area code may also be included in the vicinity of the address. In addition, an address, or addresses, may be located on different pages of an advertiser Web site for the local business. - Any data that is collected from Web pages and documents can be anonymized to protect individual users, through, for example, removal of personally identifying information, demographic aggregation of data, anonymization of user identifiers and/or device identifiers, and the like.
- In
step 510 ofFIG. 5 , thead server 110 begins analysis of a landing page. Instep 510, a determination is made as to whether the landing page is for a local business, i.e., incorporates an explicit address. - In
step 510, when the landing page is determined to be for a local business, instep 520 the ad analysis andselection component 220 extracts the address and/or phone number and instep 530, the address is qualified as a potential geographic location associated with the landing page. In the case that the landing page incorporates a phone number, but not an address, an address can be obtained by reverse lookup on the phone number. - In
step 510, when the landing page is not for a local business, i.e., does not contain an explicit structured address,step 540 is performed in the ad analysis andselection component 220. Instep 540, the page is analyzed for information that indicates a geographic location. The landing page can be analyzed for words or phrases that indicate city names, major landmarks, or street names. City names, major landmarks, or street names may be extracted based on terms maintained in the geo-location database 135. Instep 550, the geographic location of the landing page is determined based on the extracted location information and the landing page is tagged (annotated) as a local landing page. - In
step 560, other pages are followed using theadvertiser server 140 and analyzed beginning atstep 510 in a similar manner in the ad analysis andselection component 220. Further links from the landing page may be followed to other pages of the advertiser Web site. The other pages may be tagged (annotated) as being a local page. - In
step 570, a geographic location is inferred for all pages that have been tagged. If other addresses are incorporated in other pages of the advertiser Web site, a determination can be made as to which address is the most common. The most common address is qualified as a geographic location for the landing page. If only one address is incorporated in multiple pages of the advertiser Web site, the address is identified as being unambiguous. The unambiguous address is qualified as a geographic location associated with the landing page. - In
step 580, the inferred geographic location is provided as a geographic location of a Advertiser's Web site. -
FIG. 6 is a flowchart for determining an inferred geographic locus for a publisher page, document, or application based on pages or documents in a publisher Web site. Instep 610, if a publisher page or document contains an explicit address/phone number,step 620 is performed in which the explicit address/phone number information is extracted and instep 630 is used to determine a possible geographic locus for the publisher page or document. - If, in
step 610, a publisher Web page does not include an explicit address and/or phone number from which an address can be determined, a geographic locus for the publisher Web page can be inferred in a manner similar to the analysis performed for landing pages. Instep 640, the publisherpage analysis component 250 determines if any city names, major landmarks, street names, etc. are incorporated that would indicate a geographic locus. If there are multiple city names, major landmarks or street names, a geographic locus for the publisher Web page may be inferred and instep 650, qualified as a potential geographic locus. - In the example publisher Web page shown in
FIG. 10 , a geographic locus for the publisher Web page can be inferred from the location information contained in the page, for example, location information of “Blue Ridge Mountains,” “Pennsylvania,” “Georgia,” “Blue Ridge Parkway,” “Shenandoah National Park,” “Great Smoky Mountains National Park,” “James River,” “Lynchburg,” and “Kanawha Canal.” As “James River” and “Blue Ridge Parkway” are mentioned multiple times, an inferred geographic locus for the publisher Web page may be an area where the James River and the Blue Ridge Parkway are in common. - In
step 660, steps may be repeated for other publisher Web pages or documents.FIG. 11 shows an example of another publisher Web page at the publisher Web site. The Web page inFIG. 11 includes an explicit location label and telephone label. The location “North of Big Island,” may be inferred as the location for the other publisher Web page. Instep 670, a geographic locus is inferred for all analyzed pages of a publisher Web site. Instep 680, the inferred geographic locus is provided as a geographic locus of a publisher page, document or application. -
FIG. 7 is a flowchart for retrieving relevant ads and ranking retrieved ads taking into consideration proximity to publisher geographic locus. The process inFIG. 7 can use location data in thead database 120 resulting from the process inFIG. 3 and locus data in thepublisher database 130 resulting from the process inFIG. 4 . Instep 710, if a publisher Web site has an extracted geographic locus, step 720 can be performed in which online ads can be retrieved from thead database system 120 for ads that have designated geographic targeting for a specific geographic locus. In addition, instep 710, if a publisher Web site does not include an explicit address or phone number from which a geographic locus can be extracted, step 730 can be performed in which online ads can be retrieved from thead database system 120 based on the inferred geographic location for the tagged advertiser landing pages. - In the example display shown in
FIG. 12 , online ads have been automatically inserted into the publisher Web page. Online ads are obtained from thead database system 120 based on criteria such as relevance to the content in the publisher Web page. Thead consumer interface 240 can insert a selected online ad(s) for insertion based on a request from the publisher Web page for ad(s).FIG. 13 shows an example of a type of script that may be incorporated into the code for the publisher Web page. The script designates parameters used in display of an online ad and an address to which the request for an ad(s) is sent. Although the example script is Javascript, one of ordinary skill would understand that other locally executable programs may be used instead to accomplish the same functions. - In
step 740, the retrieved online ads can be ranked in the ad ordering and rankingcomponent 230 based on proximity to the publisher geographic location. The online ads ranked based on proximity can be evaluated based on other criteria such as relevance to content of the publisher Web page by thead consumer interface 240, to be automatically inserted into the publisher Web page for display to a user at auser device 160. - Further according to the example, the ad analysis and
selection section 220 can use the inferred location of “James River” and “Blue Ridge Parkway” to retrieve online ad(s) fromad database system 120. In the example display shown inFIG. 14 , an online ad for “Canoe Outfitter” is inserted into the publisher Web page. A landing page for the “Canoe Outfitter,” shown inFIG. 15 , indicates that the location is Madison Heights, Virginia, which is a town outside of Lynchburg, located along the James River in the vicinity of where the Blue Ridge Parkway crosses the James River. Thus, the ad analysis andselection component 220 has retrieved an online ad that may otherwise have not been considered for insertion into the publisher Web page, thereby expanding the pool of ads that can be considered for insertion. -
FIG. 16 is a block diagram illustratingad server 110 configured ascomputing device 1600 that is arranged for inferring location from landing pages and matching with publisher's page in accordance with the present disclosure. In a very basic configuration 1601,computing device 1600 typically includes one ormore processors 1610 andsystem memory 1620. A memory bus 1630 can be used for communicating between theprocessor 1610 and thesystem memory 1620. - Depending on the desired configuration,
