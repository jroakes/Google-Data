Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to communication systems, and more particularly, to a method for transmitting a quick paging channel at different power levels at a base station.
- the base station In order to ensure that stored configuration parameter values are up-to-date for mobile stations monitoring the QPCH paging indicator bits, the base station, after updating the overhead configuration information, sets all QPCH paging indicator bits to "ON" for an amount of time which is a function of the maximum slot cycle index. For example, in current systems, the base station sets all QPCH paging indicator bits to "ON" for 1.28 seconds if the maximum slot cycle index is set to 0. This is described in TR45.5.2.3.SIG/98.11.17.07, TR45.5.2.3.SIG/98.11.17.08, and TR45.5.2.3.SIG/98.11.18.06.

- TR45.5 has adopted a Quick Paging Channel (QPCH) approach to increase mobile station battery life in the next version of TIA/EIA-95-B.
- This next version is commonly known as cdma2000.
- the QPCH as well as the paging channel (PCH) in the cdma2000 standard are channels broadcast on a common frequency spectrum of a CDMA communications system.
- a pilot channel is also broadcast.
- the channels may be associated with Walsh codes or other unique spreading codes.
- the QPCH reduces the amount of time a mobile station is awake. As used herein, a mobile station is awake when it is consuming power from a power source to demodulate a channel using a radio frequency receiver and demodulation hardware.
- the term “wake up” is used to mean activation of, and application of a power source to, hardware necessary for demodulating a paging signal.
- the terms “sleep” and “go to sleep” refer to the deactivation of the hardware for the purpose of conserving a power source in the mobile station.
- a paging indicator bit indicates to the mobile station whether it is to wake up for its paging channel slot to receive a page.
- On-off keying is used by the base station to transmit the QPCH bits. For example, for one value the base station transmits a spread spectrum signal at a given power level during the bit time period using a particular spreading code and for the other value the base station does not transmit any power during the bit time period using the particular spreading code.
- the mobile station When the mobile station receives a QPCH bit, there are preferably three possibilities: "ON”, “OFF”, or “not certain”. “ON” means that the base station clearly transmitted the bit. “OFF” means that the base station clearly did not transmit the bit. “Not certain” means that the mobile station is not certain whether or not the base station transmitted the bit. If the mobile station determines that the received power for the QPCH bit time period and spreading code is sufficiently strong, then it can be certain that the base station transmitted the bit. If the mobile station determines that the pilot power for the QPCH bit time period is sufficiently strong and that there is little received power for the QPCH bit time period and spreading code, then it can be certain that the base station did not transmit the bit. If the mobile station determines that the pilot power for the QPCH bit time period is not sufficiently strong, the mobile station cannot be certain whether or not the base station transmitted the bit.
- FIG. 1 depicts a quick paging channel 100 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- Quick Paging Channel 100 is preferably divided into 80 ms slots 101 called Quick Paging Channel slots.
- Associated with a mobile station's "regular" 80 ms paging channel (PCH) slot 101 is a Quick Paging Channel (QPCH) slot 103.
- PCH personal computer
- QPCH Quick Paging Channel
- the beginning of a QPCH slot 103 preferably occurs 100 ms earlier in time than the beginning of the associated PCH slot 101.
- Each QPCH slot 103 is preferably divided into four 20 ms frames 105-108.
- a mobile station's first paging indicator bit will preferably be in one of the first two 20 ms frames 105 or 106 of the QPCH slot 103.
- a mobile station's second paging indicator bit will preferably occur in the frame two frames after the frame containing the mobile station's first paging indicator bit.
- FIG. 2 shows an example of the bit positions of a mobile station's QPCH paging indicator bits 201 in accordance with the prior art. It should be noted that the positions of a mobile station's QPCH paging indicator bits 201 within a QPCH slot 203 vary as a function of the system time.
- the base station In order to ensure that stored configuration parameter values are up-to-date for mobile stations monitoring the QPCH paging indicator bits 201, it has been proposed that the base station, after updating the overhead configuration information, sets all QPCH paging indicator bits 201 to "ON" for an amount of time which is a function of the maximum slot cycle index.
- the amount of time is 1.28 seconds if the maximum slot cycle index is set to 0.
- the amount of time could be 2.56 or 3.84 seconds if the maximum slot cycle index is set to 0, or 2.56, 5.12, or 7.68 seconds if the maximum slot cycle index is set to 1.
- a mobile station When a mobile station is in idle mode and is monitoring a paging channel or quick paging channel, it measures the strengths of pilot signals of neighboring base stations. When a mobile station determines that a neighboring pilot signal is sufficiently stronger than the pilot signal associated with the base station whose paging channel or quick paging channel is being monitored, it performs a handoff to the neighboring base station to monitor the paging channel and quick paging channel of the neighboring base station. This type of handoff is called an idle handoff.
- mobile stations have a 10 minute timer for remembering stored configuration parameter values when performing idle handoffs from cell to cell. For example, if a mobile station receives configuration parameter values from cell A, performs an idle handoff to cell B, then 5 minutes later performs an idle handoff back to cell A, the mobile station retrieves its stored configuration parameter values. The mobile station need not waste its battery or other power source receiving the configuration parameter values again if a sequence number, such as the CONFIG -- MSG -- SEQ in a configuration message or General Page Message, still matches the stored value for the cell.
- a sequence number such as the CONFIG -- MSG -- SEQ in a configuration message or General Page Message
- a mobile station updates its configuration parameter values by receiving the paging channel over which configuration parameter messages are sent for a period of time until all configuration parameters are up-to-date.
- Cdma2000 mobile stations may also update configuration parameters by receiving a paging channel.
- Another possibility is to update configuration parameters by receiving a special broadcast channel (BCCH), over which configuration parameter messages are sent for a period of time, until all configuration parameters are up-to-date.
- BCCH is a channel similar to the PCH and is spread in a similar manner and is typically broadcast in the same frequency spectrum.
- the base station when updating its configuration parameter values, preferably sets all QPCH paging indicator bits to "ON" for a short time compared to 10 minutes, when a mobile station performs an idle handoff back to a cell for which it has stored overhead information, it would have to wake up for a paging channel slot in order to insure that its overhead information is up-to-date. This time ranges from 20 ms to 160 ms. Waking up for such a relatively long time defeats the purpose of the QPCH. Idle handoffs can be quite frequent in the soft handoff region between cells, and are wasteful of the battery or other power source.
- the result could be a lost mobile station, i.e. a mobile station which does not respond when paged.
- the mobile station could be monitoring the wrong channel.
- the power level of the QPCH were lowered, the mobile station might not respond when paged. Quickly updating the mobile when the overhead information changes is critical.
- the mobile station would be able to determine immediately after the idle handoff if configuration information has changed without waking up for a paging channel slot.
- each QPCH bit 301 is reserved as a Configuration Change indicator bit 303.
- a QPCH bit is reserved as a Configuration Change indicator bit every 5 ms.
- a QPCH bit is reserved as a Configuration Change indicator bit every 20 ms.
- a mobile station When a mobile station performs an idle handoff, it receives at least one configuration change indicator bit 303 for the new base station if the ten minute timer for the new base station has not expired.
- the mobile station can receive and combine multiple configuration change quick bits. This is helpful in RF conditions where the signal from the base station is weak and the mobile station could not otherwise be confident that the configuration is not being changed.
- the mobile station receives one or two paging indicator bits 305. If the mobile station is confident that there is no page and is confident that there was no configuration change, it will go to sleep until the next quick paging slot. It should be noted that Configuration Change indicator bit 303 is only monitored by the mobile after an idle handoff; once the mobile is confident that there is no change in configuration, it does not have to receive a configuration change bit 303 in a subsequent quick paging slot. This is an important feature of the invention because power is consumed monitoring the configuration change quick bit only for the first quick paging slot after an idle handoff.
- the mobile station determines that the configuration has changed after receiving a configuration change quick bit, it will wake up for its regular paging slot and stay awake until it the configuration parameter values are up-to-date. Consequently, the present invention provides a greatly enhanced battery life by waking up the mobile station only when necessary to receive up-to-date configuration parameters.
- a broadcast channel BCCH
- the mobile station determines that the configuration has changed after receiving configuration change indicator bit 303
- the mobile station wakes up and receives the BCCH until the configuration parameter values are up-to-date.
- the mobile station does not support simultaneous demodulation of a BCCH and a PCH
- the mobile station wakes up and receives its PCH slot first if required based upon the paging indicator bits, then receives the BCCH.
- This method can also prevent the mobile station from missing a page.
- a mobile station supports simultaneous demodulation of a BCCH and a PCH; in this case the mobile would receive the BCCH and simultaneously receive the PCH if required based upon the paging indicator bits. Simultaneous demodulation of the PCH and BCCH can be used to conserve the battery or other power source by minimizing the amount of time the radio receiver and associated hardware are on and consuming power.
- the mobile station should conserve the battery or other power source by not waking up to receive either the paging indicator bits or the configuration change indicator bits. This applies when there is no BCCH and only a PCH. If a BCCH is configured in this case, the mobile station preferably wakes up for the BCCH without waking up for the configuration change indicators. Alternately, the mobile station may receive the paging indicator bits to determine whether to wake up for the PCH.
- FIG. 4 depicts a flowchart 400 of the mobile station procedure.
- the mobile station scans (401) the neighbor pilots by waking up and measuring the pilot strengths of the neighboring pilots.
- the mobile station determines (405) if a neighboring pilot is sufficiently stronger than the currently monitored pilot. If the result of step 405 is negative, the mobile station proceeds to step 410; otherwise the mobile station proceeds to step 425.
- the mobile station wakes up and receives (410) the first paging indicator bit. If the mobile station determines (411) that the first paging indicator bit is "OFF”, the mobile station proceeds to step 415. If the first paging indicator bit is not "OFF”, the mobile station goes (412) back to sleep, then wakes up (413) again and receives (414) the second paging indicator bit, then goes (416) back to sleep and proceeds to decision step 415.
- the mobile station determines (415) if it is confident that there is no page in the following PCH slot. If the mobile determines that either of the paging indicator bits was "OFF”, then the result of decision step 415 is positive and the mobile station proceeds to step 430. If neither paging indicator bit was "OFF", the result is negative and the mobile station wakes up (420) and receives the PCH until it either receives a page directed to it or until it determines that there are no pages for it in the PCH slot. The mobile station then proceeds to step 430. The mobile station sleeps (430) until the next QPCH bit it must receive; when the mobile station wakes up for the next QPCH bit this may be several ms earlier than the QPCH bit to allow enough time for neighbor searching. After step 430 the mobile station proceeds back to step 401.
- the mobile station performs (425) the idle handoff to the new pilot.
- the mobile station determines (435) whether its configuration parameter value timer has expired for the new base station. If the result of this step is positive, the mobile station wakes up (440) and receives the updated configuration parameters. This is preferably accomplished without receiving the configuration change indicator, because to receive the configuration change indicator would consume power from the battery or other power source when the mobile station has no choice but to wake up to receive the configuration parameters.
- the mobile station then goes to sleep until the next QPCH bit as in step 430. The mobile station then proceeds back to step 401.
- the mobile station receives (445) configuration change indicator bits and paging indicator bits on the QPCH as necessary. Reception of paging indicator bits is performed in a similar manner as in steps 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, and 415. If there is no BCCH and the mobile station does not determine that that one of the paging indicator bits is off, it can avoid being awake for the configuration change indicator bit since it must in this case wake up for the PCH slot anyway. Typically, however, the mobile station would receive at least one paging indicator bit and at least one configuration change indicator bit.
- the mobile station receives the first paging indicator and, after receiving it, stays awake until the next scheduled configuration change indicator bit, receives it, and then goes back to sleep. If the mobile station does not determine that the first paging indicator is set to "OFF”, the mobile station then wakes up in time to receive the second paging indicator. If the mobile station receives the second paging indicator, determines that it is set to "OFF”, but did not determine that the first received configuration change indicator bit was set to "OFF”, the mobile station stays awake to receive a second configuration change indicator bit. This is preferably the next scheduled configuration change indicator bit.
- the mobile station determines (446) that the second configuration change indicator bit is set to "OFF”, it preferably goes (447) to sleep and then proceeds to step 450. If the mobile station determines (446) that the second configuration change indicator bit is not set to "OFF”, the mobile station determines (448) whether the configuration change bits are "OFF” by combining the results of the first two configuration change indicator bits. If, after combining the two configuration change indicator bits the mobile station is confident there has not been a configuration change, it preferably goes to sleep and proceeds to step 450. If the mobile station determines (448) that the configuration change indicator bits are not "OFF”, the mobile station preferably remains awake (449) for yet another configuration change bit, reevaluates, and so on.
- the mobile station may go back to sleep even though it is not confident that there has been a configuration change. If the mobile station receives a configuration change indicator bit at any time and determines that it is "ON", it need not stay awake for the sake of receiving another configuration change indicator bit. After receiving configuration change indicator bits and paging indicator bits as needed, the mobile station proceeds to decision step 450.
- the mobile station determines (450) if it is confident that there is no page in the slot and if it is confident that there has not been a configuration change. If the result of step 450 is positive, the mobile station sleeps (460) until the next QPCH bit as in step 430 and then proceeds back to step 401. If the mobile station is not confident that there is no page and no configuration change, the mobile station wakes up (455) and makes sure that it has up-to-date configuration parameter values if it is not confident that there has not been a configuration change. The mobile station also must stay awake for its paging channel slot until it either receives a page directed to it or until it determines that there are no pages for it in the PCH slot. After the mobile is sure that its configuration parameter values are up-to-date and there are no pages for it, it sleeps until the next QPCH bit as in step 430 then proceeds to step 401.
- the base station When the base station updates its configuration parameter value information, it preferably sets all QPCH paging indicator bits to "ON" for an amount of time which is a function of the maximum slot cycle index. If the change in configuration parameter values includes a change in the power level of the QPCH, the power level of the paging indicator bits for this time period is set to the old QPCH power level. This is particularly important in order to ensure that mobile stations monitoring the QPCH paging indicators wake up to receive the new parameters when the power of the QPCH is being reduced. If the reduced power level were used immediately, the mobile stations could become “lost” because they are unaware of the configuration change. After this time period, the new power level of the paging indicator bits may be used.
- the base station when the base station updates its configuration parameter value information, it sets all Configuration Change indicator bits to "ON" for a predetermined amount of time, preferably for ten minutes after changing the configuration information. If the change in configuration parameter values includes a change in the power level of the QPCH, the power level of the configuration change indicator bits for this time period is set to the old QPCH power level. This is particularly important in order to ensure that mobile stations monitoring the QPCH configuration change indicators after an idle handoff wake up to receive the new parameters when the power of the QPCH is being reduced. If the reduced power level were used immediately, the mobile stations might become "lost" because they are unaware of the configuration change. After this time period, the new power level of the configuration change indicator bits is preferably used.

- max (x, y) indicates the maximum of x and y.
- the mobile station monitors the Paging Channel in certain slots assigned to it, as described below. Otherwise, the mobile station monitors the Paging Channel in each of its assigned slots. For its assigned slots, the mobile station will begin monitoring the Paging Channel in time to receive the first bit of the slot. If the mobile station is not configured to receive broadcast addresses, the mobile station will continue to monitor the Paging Channel until predetermined conditions are satisfied.

- the mobile station preferably chooses the range N and the modifiers DECORR, DECORR 1 , and DECORR 2 according to the application as shown in FIG. 6.
- HASH -- KEY [0 . . . 11] denotes the 12 least significant bits of HASH -- KEY.
- the base station may support a Quick Paging Channel.
- a Quick Paging Channel When a Quick Paging Channel is supported, the base station transmits paging indicators to the mobile station in the assigned positions in the assigned Quick Paging Channel slot.
- the base station sets the paging indicators to "ON" if the mobile station is to receive the Paging Channel in the Paging Channel slot following its assigned Quick Paging Channel slot.
- the base station preferably sets all paging indicators to "ON" for each Quick Paging Channel slot for a time interval of T units of 1.28 seconds, where:
- N is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- the base station If the base station operates with a Quick Paging Channel, after any configuration parameter value is updated, the base station preferably sets all configuration change indicators to "ON" for each Quick Paging Channel slot for a time interval of 600 seconds. At all other times, the base station sets all configuration change indicators to "OFF.
