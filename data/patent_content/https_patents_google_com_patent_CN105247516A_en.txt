Publisher website 104 comprises one or more resources 105 of associating with territory and carrys out trustship by the one or more servers in one or more position.Usually, website is the set of the webpage of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) (HTML) form, and it can comprise text, image, content of multimedia and compile element, such as, and script.Each publisher website 104 is safeguarded by content publisher, and content publisher is the entity controlling, manage and/or have publisher website 104.
Resource to be provided through network 102 by publisher website 104 and to have any data of resource address (such as, URL(uniform resource locator) (URL)).Resource 105 can be html page, electronic document, image file, video file, audio file and raw material sources etc.Resource can comprise embedded information, such as, and metamessage and hyperlink, and/or embedded instruction, such as, client script.
User's set 106 is electronic installations under control of the user and can asks through network 102 and receive resource.Other device that exemplary user device 106 comprises personal computer, mobile communications device and can transmit and receive data through network 102.User's set 106 generally includes user's application, and such as, web browser, to facilitate transmission through the data of network 102 and reception.Web browser can make user can show text, image, video, music and out of Memory on the webpage at the website place usually in WWW or LAN (Local Area Network) and mutual with it.
The conveniently search of these resources 105, search engine 110 is by crawl publisher website 104 and the resource 105 that index publisher website 104 provides carrys out recognition resource.Resource 105 is indexed, and index data is stored in index 112.
User's set 106 submits search inquiry 109 to search engine 110.Search inquiry 109 is submitted to the form of searching request, and it comprises searching request, and alternatively, mark submits the unique identifier of the user's set 106 of request to.Unique identifier can be the data from the cookie being stored in user device, if or user has the account of search engine 110, user account identifier, or some other identifiers of the user of identifying user device 106 or use user's set.
In response to searching request, search engine 110 makes index of reference 112 to identify resource associated with the query.Search Results with the form recognition resource of Search Results, and is returned to user's set 106 by search engine 110 in result of page searching resource 111.Search Results is the data generated by search engine 110, its recognition resource or provide the information meeting particular search query.The text fragments can comprise web page title to the Search Results of resource, extracting from webpage and the URLs of this resource, such as, the URL of webpage.
Based on the score relevant with the resource that Search Results identifies, such as, information retrieval (" IR ") score and alternatively each resource, relative to the independent rank (such as, authoritative score) of other resource, carry out placement search result.Search Results must assign to sort and be supplied to user's set according to this order according to these.
User's set 106 receives result of page searching 111 and plays up this page so that present to user.Select Search Results in response to user at user's set 106 place, user's set 106 asks the resource 105 identified by the URLs be included in selected Search Results.The publisher of the publisher website 104 of trustship resource 105 receives the request to resource from user's set 106, and resource 105 is supplied to requesting party's user's set 106.
In some implementations, the search inquiry 109 submitted to from user's set 106 is stored in inquiry log 114.To quote for searched result and the selection data of the inquiry be easily selected by a user and webpage are stored in and select in daily record 116.Inquiry log 114 and selection daily record 116 limit search historical data 117, it comprises from the data also relevant with it with the prior searches request that unique identifier associates.Daily record is selected to represent the action that the Search Results provided in response to search engine 110 is taked.The resource that inquiry log 114 and the query mappings selecting daily record 116 to can be used for user's set to submit to extremely identify in Search Results and the action that user takes when presenting Search Results in response to inquiry.In some implementations, data and the identifier linkage from searching request, to make the search history of each identifier addressable.Therefore search engine can use selects daily record 116 and inquiry log 114 to the respective queries sequence determined user's set 106 and submit to, in response to inquiring about the action taked and how long submit Query is once.
Search engine 110 uses inquiry log and search sequence to determine the queiy refinement done search inquiry during search sessions.Such as, search engine 110 determines that user can utilize flavor type, such as French or Italian type, or utilizes Price Range etc. to revise initial search query.
§ 1.2 topic is pointed out
Search engine 110 uses these queiy refinement to determine that topic prompting is for search sessions after a while.Such as, at time T
1, user's typing search inquiry " restaurant in San Francisco " and search inquiry is supplied to search engine 110 by the device 106 of user.
Maker 118 of refining utilizes search history data 117, and such as, inquiry log 114, comes for query selection queiy refinement, and wherein queiy refinement meets the similarity with the threshold level of inquiry.Such as, maker 118 of refining selects queiy refinement " the Italian type restaurant in San Francisco ", " French food restaurant in San Francisco ", " the Japanese restaurant in San Francisco ", " restaurant near the Union Square of San Francisco " and " the Japanese restaurant near the harbour of San Francisco ".
At time T
2, maker 118 of refining determines cluster of refining for queiy refinement, and wherein each cluster of refining associates with the topic from queiy refinement.Such as, maker 118 of refining is trooped to make queiy refinement according to type, and to refine cluster based on the n unit " Italian type " in queiy refinement, " French " and " Japanese " selection " local flavor ", and to refine cluster based on n unit " near Union Square " and " near harbour " selection " position ".Here, local flavor cluster of refining comprises queiy refinement " the Italian type restaurant in San Francisco ", " French food restaurant in San Francisco ", " the Japanese restaurant in San Francisco " and " near the harbour of San Francisco Japanese restaurant ", and refine in position, cluster comprises queiy refinement " restaurant near the Union Square of San Francisco " and " the Japanese restaurant near the harbour of San Francisco ".
N unit can be the continuous sequence of n the item from given text sequence.Each in n item can be phoneme, syllable, letter, word, numeral or basis to etc.The value alterable of n, be such as one for unitary, be two for binary, the rest may be inferred.
Maker 118 of refining cluster of refining is supplied to cluster points-scoring system 120, and it is marked to each cluster of refining.Such as, based on the quantity that occurs in the queiy refinement associated with respective cluster topic of n unit, cluster points-scoring system 120 cluster of being refined by local flavor associates with top score, and cluster of being refined position associates with lower score.
The cluster of refining with top score selected by cluster selector switch 122, and generates topic prompting based on this cluster of refining.Such as, cluster selector switch 122 select local flavor refine cluster and generate topic prompting " which kind of local flavor you like? "Alternatively, the most higher assessment of n can be selected to divide the set of cluster, and the topic prompting of each cluster can be generated.
Search engine 110 receives topic prompting from cluster selector switch 122, and at time T
3, this topic is supplied to the device 106 of user.Such as, the device 106 of user to user provides that speech points out " which kind of local flavor you like? "
In some implementations, at time T
3, search engine provides the Search Results in response to inquiry to the device of user.Such as, search engine 110 Response to selection in inquiry " restaurant in San Francisco " Search Results, and by Search Results with topic prompting " which kind of local flavor you like? " be supplied to the device 106 of user together.
At time T
4, search engine 110 receives from the device 106 of user points out the topic associated to select with topic.Such as, user responds topic prompting with " I likes French food restaurant ", and search engine 110 receives user's response " I likes French food restaurant ".In some implementations, when giving an oral account input user and inputting, search engine 110 receives transcribing of user's input from omnitape.Alternatively or in addition, the selection of sub-topic can be displayed to user.Such as, in the example of fig. 1, the selection such as " French ", " Japanese " can be shown.
The Search Results in response to inquiry and user's response determined by search engine 110, and at time T
5, Search Results is supplied to the device 106 of user.Such as, search engine 110 Response to selection is in the Search Results of the inquiry " French food restaurant in San Francisco " revised, comprise Search Results " Caf é Bastille ", " LaFolie " and " AmazingFrenchRestaurant ", and Search Results is supplied to the device 106 of user.
§ 2.0 example system process flow
Figure 1B is the more detailed illustration of topic prompting flow process.Occurred before user's set 106a receives inquiry although certain operations described below is described as be in, in some implementations, all operations can perform in response to this inquiry after receiving inquiry from user's set 106a.Such as, search engine 110 can receive inquiry from user's set 106a, based on this query selection queiy refinement, determines that one or more topic is pointed out, and topic is supplied to user's set 106a for this inquiry.But, for illustration object, before most of processes are below described to betide and receive inquiry from user's set 106a.Such as, for the ad hoc inquiry (such as, focus inquiry) meeting frequency threshold, cluster etc. of refining can be generated in advance.
In fig. ib, at time t
1, the first inquiry Q selected by maker 118 of refining
1.Such as, the inquiry Q often occurred selected by maker 118 of refining from inquiry log 114
1.In one example, maker 118 of refining selects " restaurant in San Francisco " as the first inquiry Q
1.
Alternatively, maker 118 of refining selects user usually to refine during search sessions the inquiry of (such as, meet refine frequency threshold) from inquiry log 114.Such as, based on the search sessions had during same search sessions before initial query " restaurant in San Francisco " and queiy refinement " the Italian type restaurant in San Francisco ", " French food restaurant in San Francisco ", " the Japanese restaurant in San Francisco ", " restaurant near the Union Square of San Francisco " and " the Japanese restaurant near the harbour of San Francisco ", maker 118 of refining selects " restaurant in San Francisco " as the first inquiry Q
1.
At time t
2, maker 118 of refining retrieves the second inquiry Q from inquiry log 114
m, wherein the second inquiry Q
min each inquiry meet and the similarity of the first threshold level inquired about.Various suitable process can be used to determine the second inquiry Q
mwhether inquire about Q with first
1similar.Such as, refining maker 118 can based on the first inquiry Q
1with the second inquiry Q with similarity classification
m, such as the inquiry in technology relevant inquiring or the shop (such as, restaurant or retail shop) to particular type, determines similarity.Similarity can inquire about Q based on search engine 110 with first
1the second inquiry Q is received during identical search sessions
m, or search engine 110 receives inquiry from identical user's set during different search sessions, etc.
Such as, maker 118 of refining selects inquiry " restaurant in New York ", " restaurant in San Francisco ", " the Mexican restaurant in New York ", " the Italian type restaurant in San Francisco ", " French food restaurant in San Francisco ", " the Japanese restaurant in San Francisco ", " restaurant near the Union Square of San Francisco " and " the Japanese restaurant near the harbour of San Francisco " as the second inquiry Q from inquiry log 114
m, wherein all inquiries associate with the inquiry of the similarity classification to restaurant.In addition, the first inquiry " restaurant in San Francisco " is included in the second inquiry Q
min.
At time t
3, maker 118 of refining is for each second inquiry Q
mdetermine queiy refinement R
m.Such as, based on above-mentioned second inquiry Q
m, maker of refining selects " the Italian type restaurant in San Francisco ", " French food restaurant in San Francisco ", " the Japanese restaurant in San Francisco ", " restaurant near the Union Square of San Francisco " and " the Japanese restaurant near the harbour of San Francisco " as queiy refinement R
m, wherein based on n unit " New York ", queiy refinement R is not included in the inquiry in " restaurant in New York "
min.As discussed in more detail below, alternative methods can comprise inquiry " the Mexican restaurant in New York " as queiy refinement.
At time t
4, refine maker 118 based on queiy refinement R
mthe topic of association is by queiy refinement R
mtroop, to create the cluster RC that refines
m.Refine cluster RC
min each queiy refinement R from queiy refinement R
m, and each queiy refinement R that specific is refined in cluster, one of topic of queiy refinement R is identical with the topic of this specific cluster of refining.Various suitable clustering algorithm can be used to create cluster.
Such as, refine maker 118 based on n unit " Italian type ", " French " and " Japanese " create have topic " local flavor " and queiy refinement " the Italian type restaurant in San Francisco ", " French food restaurant in San Francisco ", " the Japanese restaurant in San Francisco " and " the Japanese restaurant near the harbour of San Francisco " " local flavor " to refine cluster, wherein this local flavor all queiy refinement of refining in cluster have the pattern similar to " the cuisine_type restaurant in San Francisco ".Maker 118 of refining also creates " position " with topic " position " and queiy refinement " restaurant near the Union Square of San Francisco " and " the Japanese restaurant near the harbour of San Francisco " based on n unit " near Union Square " and " near harbour " and to refine cluster, and wherein this position all queiy refinement of refining in cluster have the pattern similar to " restaurant near the location of San Francisco ".In some implementations, group type can be appeared suddenly, such as, and can not predefine cluster.Select group type variable based on cluster name, such as, for local flavor, this variable is cuisine_type, etc.Queiy refinement can generate based on types of variables and suitable natural language process.Such as, the value of " $ cuisine_type " modifies the adjective in " restaurant ", and therefore, natural language process generates and refines " the $ cuisine_type restaurant in San Francisco ".
At time t
5, cluster points-scoring system 120 is to each cluster RC that refines
mmark, make score S
mset comprise the cluster RC that refines
min the score of each cluster R that refines.Such as, cluster points-scoring system 120 based on the quantity that occurs of the unit of n in the queiy refinement associated with specified cluster topic to the cluster RC that refines
mmark.In this example, cluster points-scoring system 120 all occurs once based on " Italian type " and " French ", " Japanese " occurs twice and cluster of being refined by local flavor associates with score four, associates with score two based on " near Union Square " and " near the harbour " cluster that all occurs once and by position refining.
Alternatively, cluster points-scoring system 120 can based on unique appearance of n unit to the cluster RC that refines
mmark.Such as, cluster points-scoring system 120 based on n unit " Italian type ", " French " is with " Japanese " and cluster of being refined by local flavor associates with score three, based on n unit " near Union Square " with " near harbour " and cluster of being refined position associates with score two.In other implementation, cluster points-scoring system 120 uses diverse ways to the cluster RC that refines
mmark.
Cluster selector switch 122 based on the cluster RC that refines
mthe score S of association
mto the cluster RC that refines
mcarry out rank, at time t
6from the cluster RC that refines
mdetermine that score is greater than the cluster RC that refines
min the cluster RC that refines of score of other cluster R that refines
n, and at time t
7, select to refine cluster RC
nas the first inquiry Q
1the first search to refine SR
n.Such as, cluster selector switch 122 determines that local flavor cluster of refining has score four, and position cluster of refining has score two, and selects " flavor type " to refine SR as the first search
n.Search engine 110 then can based on the first inquiry Q
1the first search is utilized to refine SR
nperform search operation.
In some implementations, search operation comprises provides topic to point out to user's set, such as, at time t
8, search engine 110 receives the 3rd inquiry Q from user's set 106a
3.At time t
9, the 3rd inquiry Q determined by search engine 110
3q is inquired about with first
1identical, and at time t
10by search suggestion SS
nuser's set 106a is supplied to, wherein search suggestion SS as topic
nthe SR that refines is searched for based on first
n.Such as, search engine 110 receives inquiry Q from user's set 106a
2" restaurant in San Francisco ", based on Q
2with Q
1identically determine that the first search of flavor type is refined SR
nwith inquiry Q
2association, and by search advise " which kind of local flavor you like? " be supplied to user's set 106a.
In some implementation, search engine 110 carries out rank to the sub-topic associated with cluster topic of refining, and sub-topic the highest for rank is supplied to the possible search that user's set 106a points out as topic and refines.Such as, the n unit be included in queiy refinement associated with local flavor topic in local flavor refines cluster determined by cluster selector switch 122, based on similar sub-topic (such as, Japanese, Italian type, French etc.) similar n unit is trooped, antithetical phrase topic carries out rank, and the sub-topic selecting rank the highest can be supplied to the selection classification of user's set 106a as search engine 110.
In one example, local flavor is refined cluster, the sub-topic of Japanese, Italian type and French selected by cluster selector switch 122, carry out rank based on carrying out antithetical phrase topic with the appearance appearing at the n unit that the local flavor particular child topic of refining in cluster associates, and one or more sub-topic the highest for rank is supplied to search engine 110.When cluster selector switch 122 determine Japanese, French and Italian type be local flavor refine the rank of cluster the highest sub-topic time, search engine 110 can to user's set 106a provide topic point out " which kind of local flavor you like---the local flavor of Japanese, French, Italian type or some other types? "User's set 106a can by the prompting of this topic in graphical user interfaces (such as, wherein each sub-topic selects option to associate with sub-topic) or point out as speech and present to user.Various suitable clustering algorithm can be used to create sub-topic cluster, and various suitable rank algorithm can be used to carry out antithetical phrase topic carry out rank.
§ 3.0 sample query server process flow process
Fig. 2 is in response to and receives inquiry, provides the process flow diagram of the process 200 of topic reminder-data.The search engine 110 of Figure 1A-B use procedure 200 can provide topic reminder-data to user's set 106a.
Process 200 receives the first inquiry (202).Such as, the inquiry the most often occurred in inquiry log determined by search engine, and inquires about from the query selection the most often occurred inquiry log first.Such as, search engine selects inquiry " restaurant in San Francisco " from inquiry log, wherein receives the first inquiry to carry out this selection independent of search engine from user.
Process 200 determines the second inquiry (204) based on the first inquiry.Each second inquiry meets the inquiry with the similarity of the first threshold level inquired about.Such as, similarity can based on the inquiry of all n units comprising the first inquiry, or has the inquiry (such as, restaurant inquiry, inquiry etc. to the technology of particular type) inquiring about identical general topic with first, etc.
Process 200 determines queiy refinement (206) based on the inquiry in the second inquiry.For each the second inquiry, maker of refining determines queiy refinement based on the second inquiry.Such as, maker is refined from the second inquiry Q
mselect as the first inquiry Q
1the queiy refinement R refined
m.Queiy refinement R
min each inquiry can be in user conversation before as first inquiry Q
1refine input inquiry, or comprise from first inquiry Q
1all n unit or the inquiry of similar n unit, etc.In some implementations, queiy refinement R
min each inquiry be first inquiry Q
1the inquiry inputted afterwards and do not have intervenient inquiry during user conversation.
Alternatively, when process does not comprise step 204, maker of refining is based on the first inquiry Q
1select queiy refinement R
m.Such as, when maker determination inquiry log of refining comprises for the first inquiry Q
1threshold quantity more than queiy refinement time, maker of refining use first inquiry queiy refinement as queiy refinement R
m, replace the queiy refinement of the second inquiry.
Process 200 generates cluster (208) of refining.Cluster of refining generates from queiy refinement, and each cluster of refining corresponds to specific topics, and each is refined cluster comprise be confirmed as belonging to refine cluster corresponding in the queiy refinement of specific topics.Such as, refine maker based on queiy refinement R
min inquiry association different topics create the cluster RC that refines
m, make each queiy refinement can be included in more than cluster RC that refines
min.
In some implementations, maker of refining is not for wherein existing and being included in the first inquiry Q yet
1in the cluster RC that refines of n unit of any topic association
mselect topic.Such as, queiy refinement " French food restaurant in San Francisco " selected by maker of refining, determine that the n unit that topic " local flavor " is not inquired about with first in " restaurant in San Francisco " associates, and topic " city " (such as, San Francisco) and " COS " (such as, restaurant) be included in the first inquiry Q
1in, and create local flavor and to refine cluster.
Process 200 carries out rank (210) to cluster of refining.Such as, score and each to be refined cluster RC based on being included in corresponding queiy refinement of refining in cluster by cluster points-scoring system
massociation.Such as, cluster points-scoring system cluster of top score and local flavor being refined associates.
Process 200 selects cluster of refining the highest relative to other cluster rank of refining in rank to search for as first of inquiry cluster (212) of refining.Such as, cluster selector switch determines that the first search is refined cluster SR
nwith the cluster RC that refines
min the top score association of cluster, and search engine utilizes the first search to refine cluster SR by continuation process 200
nand based on the first inquiry Q
1perform search operation.Such as, cluster selector switch determination local flavor cluster of refining associates with top score and selects local flavor cluster of refining to search for as first the cluster SR that refines
n.
Cluster selector switch will inquire about Q with first
1the cluster SR that refines is searched for first
nthe data of association store in memory so that use after a while.Such as, during search sessions, the first inquiry Q is received from user's set
1and the cluster SR that during same search sessions, the first search refined
nbefore being supplied to user's set, search engine utilizes inquiry log to perform step 202 to 212.Search engine can perform step 202 to 212 and first search to be refined cluster SR
nstore in memory to reduce the calculating to the inquiry that search engine usually receives.Alternatively, search engine can in response to receiving the first inquiry Q from user's set
1and perform step 202 to 212.
Process 200 receives inquires about (214) with the 3rd of the first match query the.Such as, cluster of refining was generated and is stored in memory before query time, and at query time, search engine receives the 3rd inquiry Q from user's set
3, determine the 3rd inquiry Q
3q is inquired about with first
1identical, and to refine cluster from memory search.
Alternatively, search engine can determine the 3rd inquiry Q
3q is inquired about with first
1substantially the same or similar.Such as, search engine is determined in response to the 3rd inquiry Q
3search Results also according to identical ordinal response in first inquiry Q
1.In one example, search engine determines that inquiry " restaurant, San Francisco " is substantially the same with inquiry " restaurant in San Francisco ".
Process 200 is searched for based on first cluster of refining and is generated topic reminder-data (216).Topic reminder-data can search for based on first the topic that cluster of refining associates, and can describe the request inputted the first user belonging to the n unit searching for the topic that cluster of refining associates with first.Such as, search engine utilizes the first search to refine cluster SR
nand based on the first inquiry Q
1create search suggestion SS
nas topic reminder-data.Here, the search operation performed by search engine generates topic reminder-data.Such as, when first searches for the cluster SR that refines
nbe local flavor refine cluster time, search engine generate topic reminder-data " which kind of local flavor you like? "
Process 200 receives the numeral (218) of language based on topic reminder-data.Such as, topic reminder-data is supplied to language generation system by search engine, the numeral of the language of this system creation topic reminder-data and the numeral of this language is supplied to search engine.
Process 200 provides the numeral (220) of language in response to the 3rd inquiry.Such as, the numeral of language is supplied to user's set by search engine, and the numeral of language is played to user by user's set, to present topic reminder-data to user.
The order of the step in process 200 described above is only exemplary, and the selection of topic reminder-data and transmission can be carried out according to different orders.Such as, process 200 can receive the 3rd inquiry before determining the second inquiry based on the first inquiry.In another example, process can inquire about Q in reception the 3rd
3generate topic reminder-data based on the first cluster of refining before.
In some implementations, process 200 can comprise other step, less step, or some steps can be divided into multiple step.Such as, search engine can perform step 202 to 212, and it is one or more not perform in step 214 to 220.Alternatively, search engine can perform step 202 and 206 to 212.Such as, search engine, based on the first inquiry, replaces the inquiry in the second inquiry, determines queiy refinement.
In one example, search engine can in the numeral of the forward direction language generation system request language of the numeral of reception language.
In another example, the search operation performed by search engine comprises provides topic reminder-data to user's set, and wherein the 3rd inquiry associates with same user conversation with user's set.Such as, search engine by search suggestion " which kind of local flavor you like? " be supplied to user's set.
Search engine receives the selection belonging to the n unit searching for the topic that cluster of refining associates with first, the wherein same subscriber session association inquired about of this selection and the 3rd, and this selection immediately the 3rd inquiry after, do not have other user intervenient to input for user conversation.Such as, the user of indicating user device is selected to want the Search Results of French food restaurant.
Then, the Search Results inquired about in response to first and selection are supplied to user's set by search engine.Such as, the Search Results in response to " French food restaurant in San Francisco " is supplied to user's set by search engine.
In some implementations, when the queiy refinement not determining minimum in step 206 determined by maker of refining, maker of refining repeats step 206.Such as, if first maker of refining determines queiy refinement based on the first inquiry, wherein the amount of queiy refinement is not more than the minimum of queiy refinement, then maker of refining can be inquired about similar other and inquires about to determine queiy refinement based on the second inquiry or to second.Maker of refining can repeat step 206, and the inquiry for identifying queiy refinement is expanded, until determine the queiy refinement of minimum.
In some implementation, the queiy refinement of minimum is determined based on the queiy refinement generating the minimum number of refining needed for cluster.
Fig. 3 is the process flow diagram obtaining the process 300 of component selections topic reminder-data based on associating with topic reminder-data.The search engine 110 of Figure 1A-B use procedure 300 can be marked to queiy refinement cluster and selects the highest cluster of refining of marking.Such as, when search engine 110 implementation 200, search engine 110 can implementation 300, replaces step 210 and 212.
The number of times that process 300 appears in inquiry included in cluster of refining based on the n unit associated with the specific topics of cluster of refining marks (302) to each cluster of refining.Such as, for specific one the cluster RC that refines
min each queiy refinement, cluster points-scoring system analysis and consult refine in n unit to determine that whether n unit corresponds to the topic of specific cluster of refining.When cluster points-scoring system orients the n unit corresponding with the topic of specific cluster of refining in queiy refinement, cluster points-scoring system increases the score of this specific cluster of refining.
Process 300 carries out rank (304) based on must assigning to of associating with cluster of refining to cluster of refining.The refine cluster the highest relative to other cluster rank of refining has the top score of cluster of refining.Such as, cluster selector switch selects to have the cluster RC that refines
mthe highest cluster of refining of the scoring of top score.
Whether process 300 determine the to refine top score of cluster is greater than threshold value (306).Such as, the top score of cluster of refining the highest for scoring and threshold score value compare by cluster selector switch, and determine whether this top score is greater than threshold score value.
If top score is greater than threshold value, then what process 300 was selected to associate with this top score refine cluster as first inquire about first search for cluster of refining (308).Such as, cluster selector switch determination top score is greater than threshold score value and the cluster RC that refines selecting scoring the highest
n.
In some implementations, process 300 can comprise other step, less step, or some steps can be divided into multiple step.Such as, search engine can provide multiple topic to point out to user's set what mark to cluster of refining afterwards.
Specifically, after the cluster of refining selecting scoring the highest refines cluster as the first search, search engine receives the 3rd inquiry, and the 3rd inquiry is with the first match query and for the user conversation associated with user's set.Such as, search engine receives inquiry " restaurant in San Francisco " from user's set.
Search engine provides the first topic reminder-data of user conversation to user's set, wherein search engine is searched for the topic that cluster of refining associates generate the first topic reminder-data based on first, and the first topic reminder-data describes the request inputted the first user belonging to the n unit searching for the topic that cluster of refining associates with first.Such as, search engine to user's set provide first search suggestion " which kind of local flavor you like? ", wherein this first search cluster of refining is that local flavor is refined cluster.
Search engine receives to be selected first of user conversation, wherein first selects to be for belonging to the n unit searching for the topic that cluster of refining associates with first.Such as, search engine receives from user's set and selects " I likes French food restaurant ".
Search engine is for user's set and provide the second topic reminder-data for user conversation, wherein search engine based on there is the cluster RC that refines
mthe second top score second search refine cluster association topic generate second search suggestion, the second topic reminder-data describes the request inputted the second user belonging to the n unit searching for the topic that cluster of refining associates with second.Such as, the cluster RC that refines determined by search engine
min the second high score of the high cluster of refining of scoring second.Second high score and threshold score value compare by search engine, determine that the second high score is greater than threshold value, generate the second topic reminder-data based on the cluster of refining that scoring second is high, and the second topic reminder-data is supplied to user's set.Here, search engine can refine based on the position associated with the second top score cluster to user's set provide the second search suggestion " you find ad-hoc location? "
Alternatively, search engine selects the second topic reminder-data based on the queiy refinement determined from the first inquiry and the first combination selected.Such as, when the first inquiry is " restaurant in San Francisco " and first selects to be " I likes French food restaurant ", search engine selects the second topic reminder-data based on the queiy refinement that the rank of inquiry " French food restaurant in San Francisco " is the highest.
Search engine reception belongs to second of the n unit searching for the topic that cluster of refining associates with second and selects, and wherein second selects receive continuously after first selects when inputting without any intervenient user and associate with this user conversation.Such as, search engine receives second selection of " near Union Square ".
Search engine is determined to select and the second Search Results selected in response to the first inquiry, first, and Search Results is supplied to the user's set associated with user conversation.Such as, the Search Results in response to inquiry " French food restaurant near the Union Square of San Francisco " determined by search engine, and Search Results is supplied to user's set.
Search engine carrys out repetition refinement procedure by providing additional topic reminder-data to user's set, points out until search engine is determined not exist to meet the first inquiry or the first inquiry with the additional topic of the correlativity of the threshold level of the combination of the selection received from user's set.
The additional scoring of § 3.1 and selection details
In some implementations, but maker of refining inquires about based on to first the cluster of refining that the similar inquiry not comprising all n units of the first inquiry determines to inquire about.Such as, when the first inquiry is " restaurant in San Francisco ", " the Mexican restaurant in New York " and " French food restaurant in Los Angeles " are included in queiy refinement R by maker of refining
min.Here, the basic query pattern of maker identification of refining " restaurant of city ", wherein " city " represents the variable be included in from any city title in the inquiry of inquiry log.When refine maker determination match query basic query pattern time, this inquiry is included in queiy refinement R by maker of refining
mwith the cluster RC that refines
min for determining that search is refined SR
n.
This allows search engine receive any first inquiry of " restaurant of $ city " form and utilize queiy refinement R
mtopic is selected to point out.Such as, search engine can receive inquiry " restaurant in San Francisco " with " restaurant in New York " and use identical topic prompting (such as, search suggestion SS for two inquiries
n).In addition, when ad hoc inquiry does not have any queiy refinement, search engine uses the pattern being used for this ad hoc inquiry to locate the queiy refinement of similar inquiry, and it also can be used for this ad hoc inquiry.
In some implementations, when maker of refining uses basic query pattern, whether maker of refining is similar to the value of inquiring about from first to the cluster RC that refines based on the value of the variable in queiy refinement
mmark.Such as, when the first inquiry is " restaurant in San Francisco ", to the cluster RC that refines
mcompare with " restaurant near the Union Square of New York " with queiy refinement " French food restaurant in Los Angeles " when carrying out rank, queiy refinement " French food restaurant in San Francisco " associates with larger weighted value.
In some implementations, search engine inquires about Q based on the n unit in queiy refinement with first
1between similarity level to each cluster RC that refines
mmark.Such as, when first inquiry be " restaurant in San Francisco " time, with local flavor refine cluster queiy refinement " the French coffee-house in San Francisco " compared with, queiy refinement " French food restaurant in San Francisco " associates with higher weighted value.
In some implementations, cluster points-scoring system is to the cluster RC that refines
mthe position of user's set is used when marking.Such as, the queiy refinement received from the user's set the region identical with providing the user's set of the first and second inquiries can associate with higher weighted value.
In some implementations, cluster points-scoring system is to the cluster RC that refines
mthe search history of the user-association of use and user's set and/or user's set when marking.Such as, compared with other queiy refinement, search engine had previously received from user's set or the queiy refinement similar with the queiy refinement received from user's set associates with higher weighted value.
In some implementations, when search engine selects multiple topic to point out to be supplied to user's set, if search engine receives the response to the first topic prompting in response to the second topic prompting, then search engine does not provide the second topic prompting to user's set.Such as, search engine select search suggestion " which kind of local flavor you like? " " you find ad-hoc location? " and to user's set provide search suggestion " which kind of local flavor you like? "When search engine receives such as the response in " French food restaurant near harbour " or " restaurant near harbour " from user's set, when additional searching wherein in user's difference specified response limits or does not advise that the search associated limits with search, search engine by search restriction with second search for advise " you find ad-hoc location? " compare, determine to receive the data of advising in response to this search, and do not provide the second search suggestion to user's set.Then, whether search engine can meet according to the prompting of additional topic to be inquired about with first or first to inquire about and be received from the correlativity of the threshold level of the combination of the response of user's set (such as, based on threshold score value) provide additional topic to point out (such as, search suggestion) to user's set.
In some implementations, comprised by search engine utilize the first search to refine search operation that cluster performs and generate topic particular problem.Such as, when first search refine cluster be local flavor refine cluster time, search engine can Generating Problems " you want the French food restaurant in San Francisco? " as topic prompting, and this problem is supplied to user's set.Search engine can carry out select permeability based on the prior queries providing the user of the first inquiry or user's set to associate to search engine.Such as, search engine uses search history data to determine that user searches for French food restaurant usually.
The selection in response to problem received by search engine can be brief, or can be more detailed.Such as, search engine receives the response " being, near harbour " such as, and uses additional location information to identify the Search Results in response to " French food restaurant near the harbour of San Francisco ".In another example, when search engine receive response " no, looking for Chinese style restaurant " time, search engine identification is in response to the Search Results in " the Chinese style restaurant in San Francisco ".
