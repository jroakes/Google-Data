Definitions
- the embodiments disclosed herein generally relate to providing information (data) related to natural phenomena using online information systems. More particularly, the embodiments herein relate to automatically determining prominent cities that are most susceptible to transient natural phenomena.
- Transient natural phenomena such as hurricanes, tornados, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the like can cause devastating damage to populated areas that are in the vicinity or path of these natural phenomena.
- various national, regional and scientific organizations monitor, track and predict the likely behavior of transient natural phenomena. These organizations provide information to the public about the behavior and location of a natural phenomenon to warn the public of any possible danger resulting from the phenomenon. While the information provided by these natural phenomena agencies is beneficial to the public, it does entail certain problems and inefficiencies.
- One such problem is the difficulty of predicting the path or extent of a natural phenomenon.
- transient natural phenomenon is a naturally occurring physical event that is not produced by humans, but may pose danger to humans and/or property. Typically, these phenomena only occur for a limited duration of time lasting anywhere from a few seconds up to multiple days.
- Transient natural phenomena include meteorological phenomena such as hurricanes, tropical storms, typhoons, monsoons, snow storms, thunderstorms, and tornadoes as well as oceanographic phenomena such as tsunamis. Additionally, natural phenomena include geological phenomena such as volcanic activity and earthquakes.
- an online geographical information system receives natural phenomena data included in an online data feed from a natural phenomena monitoring organization such as the National Hurricane Center (NHC).
- the geographical information system converts the data into a mapping markup language which is used to generate online maps, using presentation elements of the markup language to indicate the current and/or potential future locations of a natural phenomenon.
- the geographical information system Based on the natural phenomena data, the geographical information system identifies an area of probable impact and cities that are within the identified area.
- the geographical information system calculates a score for each identified city that describes the city's prominence as well as the city's susceptibility to the natural phenomenon. That is, the score indicates the aggregate potential danger that the natural phenomenon poses to the people or property that are located in the city.
- a city's prominence is correlated to the population of the city.
- the geographical information system provides users with maps and other online presentations based upon the natural phenomena data, where the presentations include the city of most importance in the area affected by the natural phenomenon as well as attributes that describe the characteristics of the natural phenomenon such as the wind speed, pressure, and intensity of a hurricane, for example.
- the geographical information system provides the natural phenomena data to a user in response to a user search request for location related information, where the user is not intentionally searching for natural phenomena data related to the location.
- the user may request a map feature from the geographical information system, such as a request for a specific city in an online map.
- the geographical information system identifies general information related to the map feature as well as any natural phenomena data that is relevant to the search request if applicable.
- the geographical information system returns in the search results both the general information about the map feature as well as the natural phenomena data associated with the map feature.
- the geographical information system provides natural phenomena data that the user may not be aware of that is relevant to the request as well as the information sought out by the user.
- the natural phenomena data is presented in an online map that displays the natural phenomenon and its attributes.
- the geographical information system may automatically update a viewport of a user's client with natural phenomena data.
- the geographical information system monitors the viewport of the user's client to determine the geographical area displayed on an online map currently being viewed by the user.
- the geographical information system updates the online map with natural phenomenon data after determining that natural phenomena data is available for the geographical area displayed on the online map.
- the geographical information system informs the user viewing the map of the phenomenon occurring in the geographical area displayed on the map.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a system architecture of a geographical information system according to one embodiment.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an online map including a natural phenomenon forecast and the cities most impacted by the natural phenomenon according to one embodiment.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a method for providing natural phenomena information related to a map feature according to one embodiment.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a system architecture of a geographical information system 100 in accordance with one embodiment.
- the geographical information system 100 provides information describing prominent cities that will be most impacted by transient natural phenomena as well as attributes of the phenomena. In one embodiment, a city's prominence is correlated to the city's population.
- the geographical information system 100 provides the information within an online map, but may provide the information via other means such as electronic mail (email), text message, or telephone call. Providing information about a transient natural phenomenon allows people to be aware of the phenomenon so as to better prepare for it.
- a transient natural phenomenon is a naturally occurring physical event that is not produced by humans, but may harm humans or property.
- natural phenomena will be generally discussed with respect to hurricanes, but it is understood that the mechanisms herein may be applied to any type of transient natural phenomena.
- the natural phenomena data provided by the natural phenomena information source 119 describes attributes of transient natural phenomena. Attributes of a natural phenomenon generally depend on the phenomenon type and describe characteristics of the natural phenomenon.
- the attributes of the hurricane comprise the wind speed (miles or kilometers per hour) of the hurricane, the location of the center of the hurricane in terms of geospatial identifiers (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates) at a given time, the heading or route of the hurricane, the central pressure of the hurricane, the hurricane intensity that characterizes the destructive potential of the hurricane, hurricane name, and/or hurricane identification number.
- the identification module 105 identifies automatically and periodically cities that are most susceptible to natural phenomena. More specifically, the identification module 105 identifies the most prominent city in terms of population that will be most impacted by the natural phenomena. For example, the identification module 105 automatically determines which prominent city is subject to a high degree of danger from an incoming hurricane, given a current natural phenomenon information data feed pertaining to a given hurricane. Continuing this example, consider a town with a population of 10 people that is directly in the path of a hurricane and New York City that is 100 km from the hurricane. Although New York City is less likely to be impacted by the hurricane compared to the town, the identification module 105 identifies New York City as the prominent city that will be most impacted by the hurricane.

- P: contribution of the population of the city to the locality score:
-
-
- where population is the population of the city and MaxPop is a constant representing the most populated city of interest. Here, MaxPop is set at 32,000,000, which represents the population of the Tokyo metropolitan area, which is by some measures the most populous city in the world, and p is a constant weight set to 0.15. Note that in other embodiments other values can be used to represent the most populous city in the world and the weight.
- T: contribution of time to the locality score:
- T=eα(TimeLimit−time) where re the time is the estimated time in hours until the hurricane comes into contact with the city, TimeLimit is a constant (e.g., 6 hours) and α is a constant weight. In one embodiment, α is 0.1 but can be other values in other embodiments. Note that if the hurricane's approach (i.e., comes into contact with the city) is less than TimeLimit, the time contribution T is set to 1;
- E: contribution of the elevation of the city. Generally, a city is more susceptible to a hurricane if the city is close to sea level in terms of elevation. Thus, a city's higher elevation could mitigate the susceptibility of a city to a hurricane.
- E=e−β*elevation where elevation is the city's elevation (e.g., meters) and is a constant weight. In one embodiment, β is 0.01 but can be other values in other embodiments;
- C: contribution of the city's distance to the nearest coastline. Generally, a city is more susceptible to a hurricane if the city is close to a coastline in terms of distance;
- C=e−χ*distanceToCoast where distanceToCoast is the distance from the city (e.g., kilometers) to the nearest coastline and χ is a constant weight. In one embodiment, χ is 0.002 but can be other values in other embodiments.
- B: contribution of the city's distance from the hurricane's projected path of travel or track.
- B=e−λ*distanceToProjectedPath where distanceToProjectedPath is the closest distance (e.g., kilometers) from the city to the hurricane's projected path and λ is a constant weight. In one embodiment, λ is 0.02 but can be other values in other embodiments.
