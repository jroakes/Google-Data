Definitions
- This application relates to identification of and delivery of multimedia content of most interest to a viewer, such as advertisements and programming, from television service providers such as cable TV, satellite TV, and fiber optic TV, to computerized multimedia devices such as GoogleTVTM, smart phones, and various types of wireless devices.
- television service providers such as cable TV, satellite TV, and fiber optic TV
- computerized multimedia devices such as GoogleTVTM, smart phones, and various types of wireless devices.
- Television advertisements have heretofore been targeted to viewers only on a very general demographic basis, wherein an identical advertisement is sent to many viewers during a predetermined commercial break, regardless of the individual preferences of the viewers.
- the advertisements that are shown are very broad, untargeted, and often not very relevant to a given viewer watching them.
- Advertisers currently know aggregate demographic information about the general audience of a television program, and the advertisers target ads during a program based on what is relevant to its most broad demographics. However, ads may not be relevant to a large percentage of the audience despite being relevant to much of the audience.
- a method of dynamically determining television advertisements to be provided to a customer includes editing an advertisement selected for an individual customer to include content related to social networking profile information or viewing history, and displaying the edited advertisement on the television.
- the selected advertisement to be provided to the customer may be based on an individualized ad determined in accordance with interests and demographics of the specific customer obtained from the social networking profile information, or may be based on a generic ad delivered to a wide audience as described above.
- the advertisement is edited to include personalized content related to social networking profile information or other information of the customer obtained through the Internet or the customer's viewing history.
- the added matter may be any multimedia content obtained through the social networking profile information or other information such as viewing history.
- Computerized multimedia devices such as Google TVTM are configured with functionality to enable dynamic display of the edited advertisement that is specifically targeted to the individual viewer.
- viewers may explicitly identify themselves each time they sit in front of the TV, or may be automatically detected via a video camera. This type of identification is essentially “logging in” to watch TV. Explicit incentives for this can be provided such as special deals on advertised products for watching a particular show, or restricting access to certain shows. It should be noted that the term. “TV” as used herein refers to a home TV system including all of the components thereof and need not be limited to merely the TV box itself.
- a viewer (or viewers) of the TV may be detected and identified by picking up the viewer's face with a camera (e.g., a wide-angled front-facing camera) embedded in or mounted on the TV box or some component of the TV system, and using facial recognition to recognize the viewer's face from faces stored on the TV. These stored faces are associated with logon information, for online social networking or other Internet sites, that is also stored on the TV. Then, these online social networking or other Internet sites are accessed and profile information is obtained therefrom. Next, the profile and demographic information derived therefrom may be used to create a personalized and edited ad for display on the TV.
- a camera e.g., a wide-angled front-facing camera
- a TV has a wide-angle front-facing camera embedded, for example, into the top center of the TV, in order to capture the faces of all viewers watching the TV (i.e. if a viewer can see the TV, the wide-angle camera should be able to see the viewer).
- the camera may be mounted at any position, even a position structurally apart from the TV box.
- the TV also has an Internet connection. It should be noted that a viewer who “logs on” provides his account information for his social networking site. This account information may be stored at the TV, and subsequently, the stored account information may be used for this viewer based on recognition of his face, thus making it unnecessary for him to log in each time he begins a new viewing session. It should be noted that alternatively the profile information may be locally stored at the TV itself and accessed during the ad editing procedure described herein.
- the “identity” of a viewer merely relates to a “user profile.”
- the TV user profile can be associated with a social networking profile, or with information from a social networking profile. Only these anonymized user profiles may be provided to advertisers, rather than actual user identities, for privacy considerations.
- An opt-in/out may be provided for each viewer in order to address privacy concerns that may exist.
- users can set up, on their social networking profile, limitations to what the TV can access.
- Other techniques for opt-in/out or anonymization of the system may be envisioned by those skilled in the art.
- the TV detects who is currently watching by locating their online social networking profiles or viewing history, the TV then further queries the viewer's profiles at the social networking platform or platforms to identify information that will draw out the viewer's preferences to enable the system to infer demographics and deliver personalized advertisements to the viewer. If the system detects that a number of viewers are watching the TV simultaneously, the system may select advertisements that will best cater to the overall audience, either by finding advertisements that are relevant to all parties or a single advertisement that is highly targeted for each individual viewer or at least certain individual viewers in the audience. This requires the TV to have access to a full corpus of advertisements appropriately categorized so that the system is able to select the best advertisements to display for the viewers watching.
- the ads may be stored on an ad server, and the ad server may receive the profile and preference information, infer demographics and determine relevant personalized ads for delivery to the viewer(s).
- the TV system itself may obtain the profile and preference information from the social website and infer demographics therefrom, and provide this information to an ad server which then determines personalized ads for delivery to the viewers.
- Discounted to individual viewer(s) may be delivered to the TV for the viewer(s) to see.
- discounts and offers personalized specifically for the viewer(s) watching can be delivered—e.g., if the specific viewer is a member of a club card for a specific organization such as a supermarket, specific offers can be delivered to the viewer based on their past spending habits and the number of points they have accumulated. This has the capability to deliver very targeted and personalized advertisements and offers to the viewer that will be far more compelling and increase the likelihood that the viewer will act upon them.
- the advertisements may be made interactive so that the viewer can respond/interact directly with the advertisement.
- the smart TV detects who this viewer is (or the group of viewers) and can potentially detect the exact viewer by asking the viewer interacting with the TV to confirm, the viewer's actions can be directly stored against his profile. The viewer can make a purchase then and there with a credit card or any form of payment attached to the online profile. Also, another specific action may be tied to the viewer's identity such as delivery of more information after the viewing of the advertisement.
- the ads involve an inventory and infrastructure of TV ads.
- Google+TM may be the viewers' online social networking platform, and the corresponding profiles may be used, along with other technologies such as facial recognition within the Android platform.
- the system may be implemented with respect to TV programs, TV advertisement providers, TV service providers such as a cable, satellite or fiber optic TV company, and TV manufacturers, working in concert with each other.
- TV service providers such as a cable, satellite or fiber optic TV company
- TV manufacturers working in concert with each other.
- the system also can operate with any other social networking platform such as FacebookTM, TwitterTM, or others.
- “attendance” info, illation may be obtained and provided to advertisers. This information involves whether the viewer(s) actually stayed in the room while the commercial or other content played. Estimated demographic breakdown of the audience can be provided as feedback to advertisers. Further, in addition to the number of people who stayed/left, the particular individuals who (from a demographics point-of-view) stayed/left may be observed and provided to advertisers. Before the commercial is shown, the profiles of those present are used to determine what ad to show. When the commercial ends, the device should send feedback on the profiles of the individuals who remained watching during the ad. Advertisers may analyze the data to determine how effective their ad is to certain groups.
- the system may include demographics-based advertiser bidding. That is, advertisers bid on having their ad being shown to particular demographic groups, paying more or less per viewer based on the inferred audience distribution as determined by the method of this application. For example, if an advertiser prefers to have their ad shown to a male aged 25-40, they could pay a premium per viewer in this demographic as compared with all other viewers. Ads per viewer(s) can be determined by a real time bid when it comes time to show a commercial. Since a group of viewers in the same room may be of mixed demographics (i.e., a family watching TV at the same time), knowing the exact combination of demographics could inform bidding. For example, in showing a given commercial, five men watching a football game may be more valuable to an advertiser than two parents and three children; in contrast, two parents and three children may be more valuable to an advertiser for a another type of commercial.
- the associated facial recognition software alone need not be capable of determining demographics.
- the facial recognition software need not detect the gender, age, and so on of the viewer. Instead, the system merely relies on the facial recognition software to recognize the same person at different times and use his viewing history (and/or online profile) to infer demographics. From a manufacturing perspective, this has an advantage of reducing hardware requirements and cost since it does not require as much computing power or camera quality. A person's interests as determined by his viewing history (or online activities) may actually be more relevant to advertisers than gender and age.
- a computer-implemented method of dynamically determining television advertisements to be provided to a customer includes obtaining profile information of a customer; selecting an advertisement based on the obtained profile information; editing the selected advertisement to include content related to the obtained profile information; and delivering the edited advertisement to the television.
- an advertisement server includes a profile information obtaining unit configured to obtain profile information associated with a customer; an advertisement selecting unit configured to select an advertisement based on the obtained profile information; an advertisement editing unit configured to edit the selected advertisement to include content related to the obtained social networking profile information; and an advertisement delivery unit configured to deliver the edited advertisement to the television.
- a computer-implemented dynamic advertising system includes a television configured to access the Internet and further configured to display television programming; and an advertisement server connected to the television over the Internet, wherein at least one of the television and the advertisement server are configured to select an advertisement based on obtained profile information of a customer, and edit the selected advertisement to include content related to the obtained profile information of the customer.
- a computer-readable storage medium containing program code enabling dynamic determining of television advertisements to be provided to a customer includes program code for obtaining profile information of a customer; program code for selecting an advertisement based on the obtained social networking profile information; program code for editing the selected advertisement to include content related to the obtained social networking profile information; and program code for delivering the edited advertisement to the television.

- the social networking profile information obtaining unit 202 may obtain the social networking profile information of the identified customer (or customers).
- the identity of viewers can be determined based on login information.
- the identity of viewers can be determined based on facial recognition techniques.
- the identity of viewers can also be determined based on near-field communication (NFC) techniques.
- NFC techniques include, for example, using a device (e.g., handheld card, cell phone, etc.) which wirelessly communicates with a Smart TV 100 .
- a device e.g., handheld card, cell phone, etc.
- data is exchanged between the wireless device and the Smart TV to indicate that the person carrying the small portable device is within the predetermined range of the Smart TV 100 .
- the advertisement selection unit 204 selects an advertisement based on the social networking profile information obtained by the social networking profile information obtaining unit 202 .
- the selection process can be based on any of various different types of rules and algorithms.
- the advertisement selection unit 204 may select an advertisement from among a wide variety of generic advertisements (hereinafter, also referred to as an “ad corpus”) which are created by the advertisers 110 a , 110 b and 110 c and stored in the storage unit 206 .
- the ad corpus includes many different types of generic advertisements which are intended to advertise many different types of products or services.
- Each of the advertisements included in the ad corpus typically will include a combination of video data, audio data and metadata, although it is also possible to include other types and combinations of data as well.
- each advertisement in the ad corpus may include several different pieces of metadata.
- the advertisement selection unit can compare the social networking profile information obtained from a customer with the metadata of each of the advertisements stored in the ad corpus, and select the advertisement which has the highest number of matches between the metadata and the social networking profile information.
- different types of metadata can be weighted differently, to give priority to certain types of metadata in comparison to other types of metadata.
- the ad server 108 may include an index or indices associating each of the advertisements included in the ad corpus with the corresponding metadata.

- the advertisement editing unit 208 edits the advertisement selected by the advertisement selection unit 204 to include content related to the social networking profile information of the customer.
- the user can select what in the profile can be accessed by the TV for this purpose (via opt in/opt out, and/or other options), and the user can select what in the profile can be viewed by TVs in which the user's friends are logged in (e.g., access via another's profile).
- an anonymization function may be employed to anonymize the friends who are not logged in. Any technical function known to those skilled in the art may be employed in this anonymization function to allow a user to control privacy and the user's data.
- Such existing anonymization techniques are directed to privacy preserving of social network data with respect to privacy, background knowledge, and data utility.
- Existing anonymization methods for privacy preservation generally fall into two categories: clustering-based approaches and graph modification approaches. Those skilled in the art may devise any number of anonymization functions to implement protection systems with respect to privacy.
- the advertisement editing unit 208 may include different combinations of hardware and software configured to embed/inject dynamic information into specific audio/video content.
- the dynamic information is information related to the social networking profile information of the user.
- the edited advertisements may include injected images, injected audio, injected video, or a combination thereof.
- Injected photos can be actual photos taken from a user's social network of the user, the user's friends, and the user's family. These can be in photo/image/camera specific advertisements or advertisements that have no direct relation to photos, but often display photos for a personal touch (e.g. a family buying insurance for their home or home heating/gas with photos displaying in their home within the advert). This could be even more powerful if taken real-time from the most recent photo of the user taken (e.g. one that may have just been taken a few minutes ago by a friend and automatically uploaded).
- Injected photos can also be photos of the user's face (or their faces of their friends or families) on very short, slightly distant and slightly blurred video shots of people in the video with some dynamic distortion to make the image of their face appear to move with the body within the video so that a still image can look real-life and credible within the video.
- the actual person in the video should match the rough profile of the user or user's contact they are supposed to match (which can be done by querying the basic attributes on the user's social network site such as gender, age, height etc.)
- Injected photos can also be very simple injected words/phrases that are directly relevant to the user. This could be for example, call ⁇ number> on your Galaxy NexusTM if the user owned a Galaxy NexusTM phone.
- the user's name could be injected in a direct textual call to action such as “Phil, call us now on . . . ”.
- the name of a user's close friend or family member e.g. spouse
- Any other facts inferred from a user's online profile could be used in many more examples (some other examples of inferred facts are stated below under the Audio section). These would be especially powerful using real time facts derived from information posted most recently by the user of one of their contacts.
- the user's address can be used to get pictures of the user's house from Street ViewTM (for example) and this information could be used within the advertisement to give the impression that the advertisement is taking place at, or is strongly related to, the user's own home.
- the camera could quickly zoom in on the static image of the user's house and the rest of the advertisement could be filmed in a generic home that could be the user's, and would give them the impression that it is.
- the user's current location can be used to get pictures from Street ViewTM and these pictures could be used within the advertisement in a similar way to that described above—this would require access to real time location information about the user (as captured for example from the GPS coordinates of the user's smartphone).
- the user's favorite colors, brands, styles etc. could be inferred based on the clothing the user wears in the photos they are tagged within. These preferred attributes of the users could be used to color the advert appropriately. For example, the main character could be wearing clothing very similar to the user to draw a much greater, connection with them as the user could relate more strongly with them and will more likely be influenced by them. Moreover, these colors, logos etc. could be displayed in other parts of the advertisement to get the user's trust, attention and allegiance. Real-time photos of the user that have just been uploaded could be prioritized to color the advertisement based on colors that the user likes or even a color of something the user is actually wearing at the time or even an entire outfit. Of course, this technique can be made subject to opt in/opt out in order to address any issues of privacy or the like that the viewer(s) may have.
- the user's name can be injected on the audio track of the actor/narrator so that it appears that the character in the advert is talking directly to/about the user.
- the live actor's lips may need to be hidden when the user's name is called out, or even more intelligently, a variety of lip movements could be recorded to cover different names that produce different lip movements.
- the audio injection would have to match the voice of the actor/narrator, so very intelligent voice-matching technology would need to do this in real time given a textual name of a user.
- the user's favorite music could be extracted/inferred from the user's online profile and the user's friends' favorite music and this music could be played as background music to the advertisement.
- Using some music services it can be known in real time what music the user is currently or has very recently listened to. This music can be used within the advert to have even more impact.
- the videos that the user has uploaded or that the user's friends have uploaded that the users are tagged/identified within could potentially be used in intelligent ways within advertisements. For example, if sophisticated analysis was performed on these videos, snippets could be identified of the user saying certain things. If these snippets matched certain portions of the advertisement that were applicable, the snippets could be embedded within the advertisement in intelligent ways. For example, if the user was found to be saying “check this out . . . ”, this could be played at the start of an advertisement before advertising a very interesting/exciting scene, for example. This would have a very strong impact on the user, as the user would effectively be introducing the advertisement.
- a combination of the above-described techniques can be used.
- a combination of images, audio and video can be injected into an advertisement during the editing process.
- the advertisement delivery unit 210 prepares the edited advertisement to be delivered to the customer, and performs the delivery of the advertisements. For example, the advertisement delivery unit 210 formats and encodes the edited advertisement to properly deliver the edited advertisement over the network 104 to the access provider 102 , which then delivers the edited advertisement to the appropriate customer. To deliver the edited advertisement, the advertisement delivery unit 210 physically transmits the edited advertisement over the network 104 to the customer.
- the delivery of the customized advertisements to the customers may occur in many different ways, including, for example, real-time, non-real-time, and hybrid formats. These delivery formats relate to the speed at which the ad server 108 performs the selection and customization of an advertisement.
- advertisements are customized and delivered in a very quick, nearly instantaneous format as soon as the customer begins viewing a television program.
- the ad server 108 begins the process of selecting and customizing an advertisement based on social networking profile information, as described above in the General Overview of a First Embodiment section.
- the ad server 108 selects, customizes and delivers an advertisement to the Smart TV of the customer 100 a so that the delivered advertisement is displayed during the commercial break at time (y).
- a real-time connection should be established between the Smart TV of the customer 100 a and the ad server 108 .
- a benefit of the real-time delivery format is that the most recent social networking profile information can be taken into account in the ad customization process. For example, if the customer 100 a edits his or her social networking profile to indicate a preference for a certain pop music group while simultaneously viewing a television program, the ad server 108 can create the pop music group ad simultaneously while the customer 100 a is viewing the television program, and deliver the created pop music group ad to a Smart TV of the customer 100 a at the next available commercial break of the television program.
- the ad server 108 begins the process of selecting and customizing an advertisement based on social networking profile information, as described above in the General. Overview of a First Embodiment section, during a time period when the customer is not viewing television programming. For example, the ad server 108 can select and customize advertisements hours, days or weeks in advance of when the customer begins viewing the television programming. To perform this non-real-time delivery format, a real-time connection between the Smart TV of the customer 100 a and the ad server 108 is not required.
- the ad server 108 can deliver the customized ad during the next commercial break.
- a benefit of the non-real-time delivery format is that the non-real-time delivery format does not require the ad server 108 to operate at very fast processing speeds.
- certain advertisements are delivered in the real-time delivery format and other advertisements are delivered in the non-real-time delivery format.
- the hybrid delivery format may be used, for example, so that advertisements which are customized by the ad server 108 are delivered in the non-real-time format, and advertisements which are not customized by the ad server 108 are delivered in the real-time format, based on the assumption that customizing the advertisements will take additional time, which may make a real-time delivery technically difficult.
- mapping techniques to map the customers with corresponding advertisements may be employed.
- FIG. 1 there may be a plurality of customers 100 a , 100 b and 100 c , and a plurality of advertisers 110 a , 110 b and 110 c .
- mapping can be performed between the customers and the advertisers.
- the ad server 108 may create the Pop music group ad for customer 100 a .
- a first mapping example is for the ad server 108 itself to map customized advertisements to customers.
- the ad server 108 includes a storage device to store information mapping customers to respective ads.
- the ad server 108 transmits the pop music group ad to the access provider 102 along with mapping information mapping the pop music group ad to customer 100 a .
- the access provider can analyze the received mapping information and determine that the pop music group ad should be transmitted to the Smart TV of customer 100 a.
- a second mapping example is for the access provider 102 to map customized advertisements to customers.
- the access provider 102 includes a storage device to store information mapping customers to respective ads.
- the ad server 108 After the ad server 108 creates the pop music group ad for customer 100 a , the ad server 108 transmits the pop music group ad to the access provider 102 , without any mapping information. Then, upon receiving the pop music group ad, the access provider 102 can access the storage device to determine the mapping between the pop music group ad and the corresponding customer.
- FIG. 3 depicts a dynamic advertising method 300 according to an embodiment, wherein dynamic advertising method 300 includes four operations, as follows.
- social network profile information of a customer is obtained.
- an advertisement is selected based on the social networking profiling information obtained in operation 302 .
- the selected advertisement is edited (customized) to include content related to the social networking profile information obtained in operation 302 .
- the edited (i.e., customized) advertisement is delivered to the customer.
- the following description describes an example of the dynamic advertising method 300 .
- the ad server 108 obtains social network profiling information of a customer. For example, when the customer 100 a logs on to his or her Smart TV to access the Internet and initiate the viewing of television programming using his or her Smart TV, the ad server 108 determines that the customer 100 a is currently viewing television programming. Then, the social networking profile information obtaining unit 202 obtains the social networking profile information of the customer 100 a . For example, the customer 100 a may have recently edited his or her social networking profile information to indicate that the customer 100 a has recently downloaded pop music group music to his or her MP3 player. As a result, the ad server 108 can determine, for example, that (1) the customer 100 a uses a digital music player, and (2) the customer 100 a has a preference for music of the certain pop group.
- the advertisement selection unit 204 selects an advertisement based on the social networking profiling information obtained in operation 302 .
- the advertisement selection unit 204 has determined, for example, that (1) the customer 100 a uses a digital music player, and (2) the customer 100 a has a preference for music of the certain pop group. Based on this analysis, the advertisement selection unit 204 can select an advertisement from among a plurality of generic advertisements stored in the storage unit 206 by matching metadata to the social networking profile information of the user.
- the ad server 108 since the ad server 108 has determined that the customer 100 a uses a digital music player, the ad server 108 can select, for example, a digital music player advertisement stored in the storage unit 206 .
- the advertisement editing unit 208 edits the selected ad to include content related to the social networking profile information of the customer 100 a , thereby customizing the selected ad.
- the advertisement editing unit 208 can customize the selected ad so that the advertisement for the digital music player includes content related to the given pop group music, thereby achieving an extremely dynamic and personalized advertisement.
- the advertisement delivery unit 210 prepares the edited advertisement to be delivered to the customer. For example, the advertisement delivery unit formats and encodes the edited advertisement to properly deliver the edited advertisement over the network 104 to the access provider 102 , which then delivers the edited advertisement to the customer 100 a.
- an advertisement auction can be conducted which is coupled with the advertisement editing technique described above.
- advertisers may participate in a real-time auction to bid on the right to advertise at certain time slots.
- the advertisement auction could be particularly beneficial for small advertisers who could be charged $0.25 per impression, at a cap of $20/day, and thereby obtain 100 ads over the day (good for budget control). Additionally, in the advertisement auction, advertisers could pay more to get spots on premium time slots. The advertisers could also pay a premium to have advertisements customized.
- user feedback could be coupled with the real-time advertisement auction.
- user feedback could indicate whether modified ads are more or less popular than generic ads.
- another feature is to capture feedback through the user's social network (e.g., TwitterTM, FacebookTM). For example, a big news article, which is more relevant to the user, could be delivered to the user.
