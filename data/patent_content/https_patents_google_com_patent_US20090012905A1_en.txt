Definitions
- This invention relates to advertising.
- An advertiser desiring to place an advertisement in a printed publication can enter into an agreement with a publisher of the publication.
- the agreement generally includes the terms associated with the placement of the print ad. For example, if a print ad is to be placed in a newspaper, the agreement can specify the dates the print ad is to run, the section in the newspaper to place the print ad, the print ad size, and possibly other parameters. Because printed publications include manual processes, human error can lead to a print ad not running according to the terms agreed to between the advertiser and the publisher.
- the print ad simply may not run at all, the wrong print ad content may be published, the print ad may be inserted into the wrong section of the newspaper and/or may be sized incorrectly.
- a publisher provides a tearsheet (i.e., a page on which the print ad was placed in the publication) to the advertiser as proof the print ad ran in the publication.
- Publishers typically have various existing relationships with certain advertisers.
- a single publisher of multiple publications may transact with advertisers separately for each publication, or may have a single account with an advertiser that relates to numerous publications.
- the invention features techniques and apparatus whereby publisher information is received from publishers, where the publisher information includes information about available print ad space.
- a request associated with a print ad is received from an advertiser, and publishers with available print ad space are identified to the advertiser.
- the identified publishers include one or more of the publishers and at least one publisher having a specified relationship with the advertiser. Placement of the print ad of the advertiser with at least one publisher having the specified relationship with the advertiser is inhibited.
- a determination can be made whether the advertiser has a specified relationship with one or more of the identified publishers.
- An offer can be received from the advertiser defining terms for placing the print ad in a publication of one or more of the identified publishers, including a publication of at least one publisher having the specified relationship with the advertiser. Determining whether the advertiser has the specified relationship with one or more of the identified publishers can include receiving an indication of the specified relationship from the publisher having the specified relationship with the advertiser after the publisher receives the offer from the advertiser.
- Inhibiting the advertiser from placing the print ad with a publisher having the specified relationship can include preventing the advertiser from submitting an offer for placing the print ad in a publication of the publisher with whom the advertiser has the specified relationship.
- inhibiting the advertiser can include preventing the advertiser from selecting the publisher from a list of the identified publishers presented to the advertiser when the advertiser is generating the offer.
- An interface can be provided to the advertiser that includes a list of the identified publishers including at least a portion of the publisher information for each publisher and a link for each identified publisher on the list that does not have the specified relationship with the advertiser. The advertiser can select a link to submit an offer for placing the print ad in a publication of the corresponding publisher.
- An identification of one or more advertisers having the specified relationship to the publisher can be received from at least some of the publishers.
- determining whether the advertiser has the specified relationship with one of the identified publishers can include comparing the advertiser to one or more advertisers identified by the publishers.
- the request from the advertiser can include search criteria related to publisher attributes and publishers can be identified at least partially based on the received search criteria.
- the specified relationship can include a previous advertising relationship with a publisher.
- One or more indicia can be presented to indicate which of the identified publishers has the specified relationship with the advertiser.
- a request can be received from the advertiser to submit an offer to the at least one publisher having the specified relationship with the advertiser, and, in response to the request, contact information for the at least one publisher can be presented to the advertiser such that the advertiser can contact the at least one publisher directly.
- An offer may be received from the advertiser defining terms for placing the print ad in a publication of one or more of the identified publishers, and a rejection of the offer and an identification that the advertiser has the specified relationship with the publisher can be received from at least one of the identified publishers to whom the offer is submitted.
- Inhibiting placement of the print ad of the advertiser with at least one publisher having the specified relationship can include selectively inhibiting placement based on offer criteria defined by the publisher with the specified relationship with the advertiser.
- An offer can be received from the advertiser that defines terms for placing the print ad in a publication of one or more of the identified publishers including a publication of at least one publisher having the specified relationship with the advertiser.
- Selectively inhibiting placement based on the offer criteria can include comparing the offer received from the advertiser having the specified relationship with the publisher to the offer criteria, and accepting the offer for placement if the offer criteria is satisfied and/or accepting the offer for placement if the offer criteria is not satisfied by the one or more other offers.
- the invention features a system.
- the system includes a memory and an analysis module.
- the memory stores publisher information.
- the analysis module is adapted to receive publisher information from publishers and receive from an advertiser a request associated with a print ad.
- the publisher information includes information about available print ad space.
- the analysis module also is adapted to identify publishers with available print ad space, where the identified publishers includes one or more of the publishers from the plurality of publishers and at least one publisher having a specified relationship with the advertiser, and inhibit placement of the print ad of the advertiser with at least one publisher having the specified relationship with the advertiser.
- the system can further include a presentation module adapted to present to the advertiser a list of the identified publishers.
- the analysis module can be further adapted to inhibit selection of at least one publisher on the list with the specified relationship with the advertiser.
- the invention features a system including a means for receiving publisher information from publishers; means for receiving from an advertiser a request associated with a print ad; and means for identifying to the advertiser publishers with available print ad space, where publishers include one or more of the publishers and at least one publisher having a specified relationship with the advertiser.
- the publisher information includes information about available print ad space. Placement of the print ad of the advertiser with the at least one publisher having the specified relationship with the advertiser is inhibited.
- the invention features techniques and apparatus whereby publisher information is received from publishers, the publisher information including information about available print ad space and an identification of advertisers from whom the publisher will entertain offers for ad placement.
- a request associated with a print ad is received from an advertiser, and publishers with available print ad space are identified to the advertiser. Placement of the print ad of the advertiser with any publisher that has not identified the advertiser as an advertiser from whom the publisher will entertain offers for ad placement is inhibited.
- Identifying to the advertiser publishers with available print ad space can include determining if the advertiser is an advertiser with whom publishers having available print ad space will entertain offers from, and excluding publishers from the identified publishers those publishers that will not entertain offers from the advertiser.
- An online marketplace is provided, for example, by way of a web site accessible over the Internet, that brings together multiple publishers and multiple advertisers.
- the online marketplace is provided by an advertising system manager, who can be compensated for placing prints ads with publishers from advertisers by way of the online marketplace.
- a publisher with an existing set of advertiser clientele can choose to use the online marketplace for advertisers other than some or all of those included in set. The publisher can thereby choose to carry on an existing relationship with an advertiser outside of the online marketplace, while still participating in the online marketplace in terms of forming new advertiser relationships.

- FIG. 7 is a schematic diagram of an example computer system.
- Techniques, methods, apparatus and a system for advertising are described that can be used to facilitate print advertising, being advertising occurring in print for example, in newspapers, magazines, journals, periodicals, flyers, brochures, and other printed publications.
- An advertisement placed in a printed publication shall be referred to herein as a “print ad”. While reference is made to print ads, the systems and methods disclosed herein can be applied to other forms of sponsored content.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example electronic print ad management system 100 .
- the system 100 includes advertisers 102 and publishers 106 .
- a publisher 106 is an entity that publishes content (e.g., print ads) or places content (e.g., print ads) for publication with another entity.
- a publisher 106 is an entity that publishes content (e.g., print ads) or places content (e.g., print ads) for publication with another entity.
- content e.g., print ads
- An advertiser 104 is an entity that desires to place a print ad in a printed publication.
- the advertiser 104 can be a direct (e.g., an advertising entity) or indirect supplier (e.g., a middle man) of the print ad.
- the advertiser 102 and one or more of the publishers 106 may have a specified relationship, e.g., a previous advertising relationship.
- certain advertisers may be deemed to have a specified relationship with one or more of the publishers if the advertiser meets certain criteria, e.g., in terms of volumes of ads placed. That is, in one example, the top 300 advertisers in a region or nationally may be deemed to have a previous advertising relationship with certain publishers, whether or not that is actually the case.
- the significance of having a specified relationship with a publisher, or being deemed to have one, is discussed further below.
- the system further includes an advertising system manager 104 .
- the advertising system manager 104 operates to bring the advertisers 102 and publishers 106 together by way, for example, of an online print ad marketplace, as is described further below.
- a computer network 110 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects the advertisers 102 , the advertising system manager 104 and the publishers 106 .
- the advertising system manager 104 includes an analysis module 104 a and a presentation module 104 b , both of which can be of the form of executable instructions which are stored on a memory of the advertising system manager and executable by a processor of the advertising system manager.
- the analysis module 104 a can receive publisher information from a plurality of publishers; receive from an advertiser a request associated with a print ad; generate a list of publishers with available print ad space, where the list of publishers includes one or more of the publishers from the plurality of publishers and at least one publisher having a specified relationship with the advertiser; receive an offer from an advertiser specifying terms for placing a print ad in a publication of one or more of the publishers on the list, where the advertiser is inhibited from placing the print ad with the at least one publisher having the specified relationship with the advertiser; receive an acceptance from the publisher; receive print ad content from the advertiser and providing the print ad content to the publisher; and/or inhibit selection of at least one publisher on the list with the specified relationship with the advertiser.
- the presentation module 104 b can present to the advertiser the list of identified publishers and/or present indicia identifying one or more publishers with which the advertiser has a specified relationship.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart showing an example process 200 for providing an electronic advertising system 100 (e.g., an online marketplace) for publishers 106 and advertisers 104 , wherein one or more of the steps in the process can be carried out by, for example, the advertising system manager 104 .
- Available print ad space is identified (step 202 ).
- the publishers 106 can provide information to the advertising system manager 104 about available print ad space.
- the publisher information can include the name of the publication, the date or dates the publication is published, the location of the print ad space within the publication, the size and layout of the print ad space, whether the print ad will be run in black and white, color or either, and/or other information the publisher desires to provide to market their available print ad space.
- the advertising system manager 104 can provide an online marketplace in which publisher information provided by the publishers 106 is made available to the advertisers 102 .
- the online marketplace is a web site.
- an advertiser 102 can be presented with a graphical user interface (GUI) through which the advertiser 102 can input certain choices about publishers with whom they would like to place ads.
- GUI graphical user interface
- the GUI can include checkboxes, drop-down menus, radio controls, data entry fields, and/or other user input controls or combinations thereof.
- the web site includes search capabilities.
- the advertiser 102 can use the search capabilities to identify one or more newspapers meeting the advertiser's 102 geographic criteria, although a search query can be based on different and/or other search criteria as well.
- An advertiser selects one or more publishers that the advertiser is interested in placing a print ad with (step 206 ). For example, using the web site provided by the advertising system manager 104 , the advertiser 102 can provide input to the advertising system manager to choose one or more publishers 106 that the advertiser 102 is interested in placing ads with based on publisher information included on the web site.
- the publishers 106 are newspapers.
- the advertiser 102 can choose certain newspaper publishers 106 , for example, based on factors such as geography, circulation size, ad size availability, section availability and other criteria. To the extent that a publisher 106 has provided publisher information relevant to these factors to the advertising system manager 104 , the advertiser 102 has access to this information, through the advertising system manager 104 , when choosing the newspaper publishers 106 .
- the advertiser creates an offer for one or more print ads with the selected publishers (step 207 ) and can submit the offer to the advertising system manager.
- the offer can include the specific terms associated with the advertisement including the price that the advertiser is willing to pay for placing the ad.
- the advertiser 102 can select various parameters related to the desired advertising, such as the day(s)-of-week, desired newspaper section and ad size for each chosen newspaper publisher 106 .
- the advertiser 102 can input a “bid amount” (e.g., a price the advertiser 102 is willing to pay to place an ad of the selected ad size in the chosen newspaper section on the selected day or days of the week).
- the advertiser's input, including the bid amount can constitute the advertiser's “offer”.
- offers are submitted to corresponding publishers.
- the advertising system manager 104 can submit the advertiser's offers to the corresponding publishers 106 .
- submitting the offers can include sending an electronic message to the publishers that includes information about the offers.
- submitting the offers can include making the information about the offers available on a portion of a web site maintained by the advertising system manager 104 , which may be accessible only to appropriate publishers.
- submitting the offers can include making the offers available on a particular portion of the web site and notifying the appropriate publishers of the availability of the offers by electronic message.
- Each publisher 106 can respond by either accepting or declining the offer.
- a publisher 106 can decline an offer but initiate an online (or offline) dialog with the advertiser 102 as to why the offer was not accepted and the two parties can attempt to reach an agreement satisfactory to both parties.
- the print ad content can be submitted (step 210 ).
- the advertiser 102 can electronically submit corresponding print ad content to the publisher 106 .
- the advertiser can supply print ad content with the offer.
- the advertiser 102 uploads an electronic file including the print ad content to the advertising system manager 104 and the advertising system manager 104 provides the electronic file to the publisher 106 (step 212 ).
- step 209 If an offer is declined (“No” branch of decision step 209 ), a check can be made to determine if publisher feedback has been received (step 211 ). If so (“Yes” branch of decision step 211 ), an optional session between the advertiser and publisher can be initiated (step 216 ), during which, for example, the advertiser and publisher can continue negotiating terms associated with an ad placement. If no publisher feedback has been received (“No” branch of decision step 211 ), the process 200 can terminate (step 220 ). For example, if the publisher provides no comments or feedback to the advertiser 102 as to why the offer was declined, then the process terminates.
- the advertiser 102 may be motivated to provide a revised offer (“Yes” branch of decision step 222 ), and the process returns to decision step 208 . Otherwise, if the advertiser 102 does not provide a revised offer (“No” branch of decision step 222 ), the process terminates (Step 220 ).
- Step 214 includes submission of a compliance report (e.g., an electronic tearsheet).
- a compliance report e.g., an electronic tearsheet
- the publisher 106 can provide proof that the ad ran to the advertising system manager 104 .
- an electronic tearsheet can be uploaded to the electronic advertising system as proof that the ad ran according to agreed-upon terms.
- the electronic tearsheet can be an electronic file that includes an image of the ad as placed within the publication and can include enough information to show that the ad ran in the desired section of the newspaper on the selected date and according to any other specifications of the advertiser, e.g., ad size, ad color, font size, etc.
- the electronic tearsheet is a PDF file including a scanned representation of the page of the publication on which the ad ran.
- the advertising system manager 104 can provide the electronic tearsheet to the advertiser 102 .
- the advertising system manager 104 can forward the electronic tearsheet to the publisher by electronic message, by making the electronic tearsheet accessible in a portion of a web site to which the publisher has access, through a combination of providing access and sending an electronic messages, etc.
- the advertising system manager 104 can collect a bid amount from the advertiser 102 and transmit a publisher's share of the collected bid amount to the publisher 106 (Step 216 ).
- an advertiser 102 can challenge the compliance report, i.e., the electronic tearsheet, within a specified period of time after the electronic tearsheet is uploaded.
- the advertiser 102 can, in some implementations, send a challenge message to the advertising system manager 104 .
- the advertising system manager 104 may forward the message to the publisher 106 , or the advertising system manager 104 may resolve any challenge raised by the advertiser directly (e.g., in an automated manner, or with human involvement, or with a combination of both).
- the bid amount may not be collected from the advertiser 102 , and neither the advertising system manager 104 nor the publisher 106 may receive payment.
- the advertising system manager 104 automates many if not all steps in the process of either placing ads (e.g., steps taken by an advertiser 102 ) or selling ad space (e.g., steps taken by a publisher 106 ). For example, the advertising system manager 104 can automatically provide matches between advertisers 102 and publishers 106 based on their respective inputs (e.g., the advertisers' offers and the publishers' information). Further, the advertisers 102 can be provided with an electronic mechanism for uploading and transmitting the ad content to the publishers 106 . The publishers 106 can be provided with an electronic mechanism for proving the ad was placed as agreed (e.g., in the form of an electronic tearsheet).
- payment e.g., the bid amount
- the publisher can be provided with the publisher's share of the bid amount.
- the advertiser 102 is provided with a central mechanism (e.g., the advertising system manager's website) to access available print ad space of, for example, multiple publishers.
- the publishers 106 can be provided with a marketplace for their available print ad space.
- the payment mechanism e.g., a bid system
- the payment mechanism can enable the advertiser 102 to only pay what the advertiser 102 decides to pay, and the publisher 106 can choose to accept only offers that are most desirous to the publisher 106 .
- FIGS. 3A-D example GUIs of an example web site configured to implement the electronic advertising system provided by the advertising system manager 104 are shown.
- the GUIs shown in these figures are directed to the advertisers 102 and can be used to receive the advertisers' offers. These GUIs are illustrative examples, and other configurations can be used.
- a GUI 300 is shown for one particular example whereby an advertiser 102 is creating offers to place print ads with newspaper publishers 106 .
- Data fields 302 and 304 are provided wherein the advertiser 102 can input a name for a print ad campaign being created (i.e., a set of offers) and the desired start and end dates for the ad campaign.
- the advertiser 102 can choose to either search for names of newspapers by location using the search input field 306 , or can enter a newspaper name into the data field 308 .
- Other controls are provided for the advertiser 102 to search, for example, newspapers per the search criteria entered in the data fields, or by use of a drop down menu.
- a list of newspapers is provided to the advertiser 102 , and in this example, the advertiser 102 has selected the first eight newspapers from the list 310 .
- a data box 312 shown to the right of the list clearly identifies for the advertiser 102 the names of the newspapers selected and includes a “remove” control, whereby the advertiser 102 can select to remove one or more from the list.
- a second data box 314 provides additional information to the advertiser 102 about certain of the selected newspapers.
- the advertiser 102 is notified that some of the newspapers selected are a part of packages that offer discount rates if the advertiser bids on the whole package. Suggested packages to add to the list of selected newspapers are proposed to the advertiser 102 .
- Near the bottom of the GUI 300 control buttons 316 are provided for the advertiser 102 to cancel or continue with inputting information to create offers. In this example, the advertiser 102 selects to continue.
- a next GUI 320 is shown that is presented to the advertiser 102 upon selecting to continue, as described above.
- Each of the newspapers selected by the advertiser 102 using the previous GUI 300 is listed beside a set of user controls.
- the advertiser 102 can employ the user controls to input specifics about their offer for each particular publisher 106 , i.e., newspaper.
- the advertiser 102 is prompted to input the section 322 of the newspaper in which to run the print ad, the ad size 324 , and the issues 326 (i.e., for a daily publication, the day(s) of the week).
- the advertiser 102 is also prompted to input a bid amount 328 .
- a column to the right of the bid amount shows a calculated maximum weekly cost 330 , based on the bid amount and the number of days selected.
- a data box 332 can include multiple pieces of information.
- the data box 332 includes information about “overbidding”, a practice that can ensure advertisers get full use of their advertising budget. Because one or more of the advertiser's offers may not be accepted by publishers, the advertiser is recommended to create offers having a total bid amount greater than the advertiser's desired maximum weekly budget. However, only the first publishers that accept the advertiser's pending offers may secure the potential business with the advertiser. That is, a first publisher to respond to the advertiser's offers will likely be able to accept some or all of the advertiser's offers before the advertiser's maximum weekly budget is met.
- a last publisher to respond may not be able to accept any offers, if the advertiser's maximum weekly budget is already met by the earlier acceptance of offers by other publishers.
- a natural by-product of overbidding is a tacit incentive for publishers to respond quickly to advertisers offers and to minimize negotiating with advertisers, as a delay in acceptance due to negotiations can mean the offer will not longer be open for acceptance.
- Control buttons 334 allow the advertiser 102 to go back to the previous GUI 300 , continue or “save and close”.
- the advertiser 102 chooses to continue and is presented with the GUI 340 shown in FIG. 3C .
- the advertiser 102 can use the GUI 340 to upload files including the print ad content the advertiser 102 desires to place in one or more of the selected newspapers.
- data fields 342 are provided wherein the advertiser 102 can provide information for the publishers 106 , including the advertiser's name, product/service name, product/service description, and a description of persons who may find the ad content controversial or offensive.
- Controls 346 are provided for the advertiser 102 to indicate whether they plan to update their ad and/or use different ad files for different issues. For example, the advertiser 102 may upload one ad file for use in issues published from Monday to Friday and a second ad file for use in issues published on the weekend. Controls 348 allow the advertiser 102 to go back to the previous GUI 320 , continue or save and close.
- the advertiser 102 chooses to continue and is presented with the GUI 350 shown in FIG. 3D .
- the advertiser 102 is presented with a summary of the ad campaign the advertiser 102 has created, including a summary of the advertiser's offers and the ad content uploaded in the ad files.
- the advertiser 102 can select “edit” controls 352 and 354 to edit the advertiser's offers and ad content. If the advertiser 102 is satisfied with the ad campaign as shown, the advertiser 102 can select the “start my campaign now” button 356 to initiate consideration of the offers by the corresponding publishers 106 . In this implementation, the advertiser 102 is notified by email from the advertising system manager 104 as newspaper publishers 106 respond to the advertiser's offers.
- an “in progress” campaign is saved automatically. For example, if an advertiser navigates away from the summary review page without selecting “Start My Campaign Now”, the campaign information input by the advertiser is saved.
- the advertising system manager 104 may be automatically alerted to have a salesperson follow-up with the advertiser to determine whether the advertiser has questions or concerns or would like to activate their ad campaign.
- FIG. 4A shows a GUI 400 including example content directed to a specific publisher 106 , in this example, The Tribune.
- the publisher 106 is provided a summary of offers received 402 , e.g., “7 new offers”, and provided a link to another web page to view the offers (see FIG. 4B ).
- the publisher 106 is provided a summary of ad materials for review 404 , e.g., “3 new ads” and a link to download and view the ad materials.
- a link to a list of issues 406 is provided to view and edit accepted ads.
- a summary of tearsheets needed is provided 408 , e.g., “7 tearsheets needed”, and a link to upload a PDF tearsheet.
- a link to viewing reports 410 is provided, whereby the publisher 106 can view reports of all ads the publisher 106 has accepted. In this implementation, the publisher 106 can click on a button to view a list of offers received to place print ads in the publisher's publication.
- a GUI 420 is shown that is presented upon the advertiser 102 clicking the view offers 402 link shown in FIG. 4A .
- Each offer received is detailed and an action column 422 is provided.
- the publisher 106 can input selections into controls and data fields included in the action column 422 to accept an offer, decline an offer and/or to provide reasons for declining an offer and an optional message to the advertiser 102 .
- the advertising system manager 104 automatically collects the bid amount from the advertiser 102 .
- the advertising system manager 104 automatically charges the bid amount to an account the advertiser 102 has with the advertising system manager 104 .
- the advertising system manager 104 transmits the publisher's share of the bid amount to the publisher 106 (e.g., credits the publisher's account) and retains the balance as payment to the advertising system manager 104 .
- the publisher's share is 85% of the bid amount.
- a different percent or a different manner of calculating the publisher's share can be used and this is but one example.
- the amount of the publisher's share can be made contingent on when the electronic tearsheet is uploaded. That is, if the electronic tearsheet is uploaded within a first period of time after the ad is placed, then the publisher's share includes a base amount and a first bonus. By way of illustrative example, if the electronic tearsheet is uploaded within 24 hours of the ad being placed, then the publisher's share includes a base amount of 85% of the bid amount and a first bonus of 5% of the bid amount.
- different bonus amounts can be provided for different upload periods. For example, if the electronic tearsheet is not uploaded within the first period of time, but is uploaded within a second period of time, then the publisher's share includes a base amount and a second bonus, where the second bonus is less than the first bonus.
- the publisher's share increases from 85% to 88% of the bid amount, i.e., a 3% second bonus.
- the publishers performance is monitored based on the time it takes a publisher to upload an electronic tearsheet.
- different factors can be monitored as indications of good performance.
- other performance factors can include: time to respond to new offers; placement quality of print ads; percentage of print ad placements that are correctly executed; an advertiser satisfaction rating of interaction with the publisher and/or publisher ad performance. Rating the publishers performance based on one or more of the above factors, or other factors, can be systematic and automated, can be advertiser-specified or can be qualitatively judged by the advertising system manager 104 .
- a publisher may wish to inhibit specified advertisers from submitting offers through the advertisement system manager to place ads with the publisher and would prefer to transact directly with such advertisers. For example, if the publisher has a pre-existing business relationship with the advertiser and has previously placed one or more ads on behalf of the advertiser, the publisher may prefer to carry on business with that advertiser outside of the electronic print ad management system 100 . The advertiser may not, however, have a previous advertising relationship with other publishers using the system 100 . Accordingly, excluding the advertiser from the system 100 altogether may not be a suitable solution.
- the advertiser can be inhibited from placing print ads with the publisher through the system 100 , although be able to place print ads with other publishers through the system.
- the publisher “blacklists” certain advertiser with whom the publisher has a specified relationship, usually a pre-existing advertising relationship although other criteria can be employed.
- FIG. 5A illustrates a process 500 for managing print ad placement.
- Publisher information is received from one or more publishers (Step 505 ).
- the publishers 106 can transmit over the network 110 publisher information to the advertisement system manager 104 .
- the advertisement system manager 104 can provide an interface to facilitate receipt of the publisher information.
- the publisher information can include information about available print ad space in the publisher's publication(s).
- the publisher information can include information about advertisers that have a specified relationship (e.g., previous advertising relationship) with the publisher, i.e., the publisher's blacklist.
- the publisher information (or at least a portion thereof) can be stored (Step 510 ).
- the publisher information can be stored on a memory coupled to the advertising system manager 104 .
- a request can be received from an advertiser associated with the placement of a print ad (Step 515 ).
- the request can be received through an interface provided by the advertisement system manager.
- the interface can include fields that facilitate the receipt of requests allowing requests to be received in a uniform and consistent format. Increasing the uniformity and consistency of the requests can facilitate analysis of offers by a publisher, as similar offers may be more easily compared.
- an advertiser 102 may specify search criteria related to the print ad requested, such as geographical location of publication, type of publication (e.g., newspaper, online provider, magazine, etc.), length of print ad, etc.
- An interface generated by the advertisement system manager 104 can facilitate entry of search criteria by the advertiser 102 .
- the interface can allow an advertiser to select search criteria from available options.
- the advertisement system manager can search a database including publisher information to identify publishers that have available print ad space and satisfy the search criteria.
- a listing of the publishers 106 available through the advertisement system manager 104 can be generated and then publisher information provided by the publishers can be analyzed to identify publishers that satisfy the search criteria.
- a list of the publishers identified in either steps 525 or 530 is generated (Step 535 ).
- the list of publishers can include information, such as publisher name, type of publisher, attributes of print ad available (e.g., size, type, etc.), length of time ad space is available, and/or other appropriate information.
- a publisher may be included in a group of publishers (e.g., owned by a common company).
- a single publisher may provide a group of publications (e.g., owned by the publisher).
- the list of publishers may identify which publishers and/or which publications within a publisher have available print ad space.
- a “known” specified relationship is a specified relationship that is known to the entity generating the list, for example, the advertising system manager 104 .
- publisher information for the publishers with which offers for print ads may be placed through the advertisement system manager can be analyzed to determine if a specified relationship, such as a previous advertising relationship, exists with the advertiser.
- a determination may be made only with respect to the publishers on the list, as to whether one or more have a specified relationship with the advertiser.
- the “blacklist” of each publisher on the list is analyzed to determine whether the advertiser is included on the blacklist.
- Indicia can include, for example, an image, text (e.g., Not Available, Pre-existing Relationship, etc.), color, and/or highlighting.
- the indicia can be presented to an advertiser proximate a publisher name on the list.
- the name of a publisher on a list can be presented in a different color than other text and/or images on the list.
- Other forms of identification or exclusion can be used.
- the list can be presented to the advertiser (Step 550 ).
- the list may be presented through an interface generated by the user.
- the interface may list at least a portion of publisher information, such as publisher name, available space, etc.
- the interface may allow an advertiser to control the display of the list, for example, by allowing the advertiser to sort the list and/or perform queries on the list.
- Ad placement with publishers having a known specified relationship to the advertiser can be inhibited (Step 555 ).
- Publishers may inhibit offers from advertisers with a specified relationship, such as a previous advertising relationship, to separately manage advertisers with which the publisher has a direct relationship. However, the same advertiser may be allowed to provide offers to other publishers.
- a portion of the publishers with the specified relationship to the advertiser may elect to allow the advertiser to submit offers through the advertisement system manager.
- Inhibiting ad placement with a particular publisher can include inhibiting selection of the publisher through an interface generated by the advertisement system manager.
- the list may not include link (e.g., through which an offer may be submitted) for the publisher with the specified relationship.
- the list may present contact information for the publisher with the specified relationship when the publisher is selected by the advertiser, rather than presenting a link through which an offer may be submitted. The presentation of the contact information is to encourage to the advertiser to contact the publisher directly to place an ad with the publisher.
- inhibiting ad placement comes further downstream in the process. That is, the advertiser is permitted to submit an offer to place an ad with the publisher, but the offer is automatically rejected by the publisher since the advertiser is on the publisher's blacklist.
- an offer can be received from the advertiser (Step 560 ).
- the offer can include offer terms or parameters, such as bid amount (e.g., amount the advertiser is willing to pay for placing the print ad), publication time, size of print ad requested, content of print ad (e.g., text, images, video, etc.).
- bid amount e.g., amount the advertiser is willing to pay for placing the print ad
- publication time e.g., amount the advertiser is willing to pay for placing the print ad
- size of print ad e.g., text, images, video, etc.
- the advertisement system manager may generate an interface through which the offer is received. The interface may allow offer terms to be provided by the advertiser and transmitted to the advertisement system manager.
- the offer is transmitted to the publisher (Step 560 ).
- the advertisement system manager may transmit a message (e.g., email, XML message, etc.) to the publisher with the offer.
- the advertisement system manager presents the offer to the publisher through an interface.
- the offer can automatically reject the offer on behalf of the publisher, in which case the offer is not transmitted to the publisher.
- a response to the offer can be received from the publisher (Step 565 ).
- the publisher may accept, decline, and/or present a counteroffer to the offer provided by the advertiser.
- the response may be received through an interface generated by the advertisement system manager.
- the interface may present available options for responding to an offer, from which the publisher selects a response.
- selection of the publisher e.g., graying out the publisher name, dead link, etc.
- the advertiser can be notified of the rejection (Step 582 ).
- the message may be an email.
- the message may be presented through the interface generated by the advertisement system manager.
- the message may include reasons for the rejection provided by the publisher (e.g., specified relationship exists, price to low, space unavailable, etc.).
- print ad content may be received from the advertiser (Step 585 ).
- the advertiser may email the print ad content to an address specified on the interface generated by the advertisement system manager.
- the advertiser may upload the print ad content to the advertisement system manager.
- the print ad content may include an electronic version of the advertisement the advertiser is requesting publication.
- the print ad content can be transmitted to the publisher (Step 587 ).
- the print ad content may be automatically downloaded to a predetermined memory by the advertisement system manager.
- a link to the print ad content may be provided through the interface generated by the advertisement system manager and the publisher may download the print ad content using the link.
- a message may be transmitted to the publisher with the print ad content.
- an electronic tearsheet may be received from the publisher (Step 589 ).
- the electronic tearsheet can confirm placement at a placement time of the print ad in a publication according to the accepted offer terms.
- a bid amount can be collected from the advertiser (Step 592 ).
- the advertisement system manager may manage the receipt of, for example, a wire transfer or electronic fund transfer to an account (e.g., PayPal account, bank account, etc.) of the advertisement system manager from the advertiser.
- the publisher's share of the bid amount is provided to the publisher (Step 594 ).
- the advertisement system manager may automatically electronically transfer at least a portion of the bid amount to the publisher.
- the advertisement system manager may automatically deduct the portion of the bid amount payable to the advertisement system manager for managing the transaction.
- Process 500 can be implemented by example system 100 or similar systems.
- various operations may be added, deleted, modified, or reordered in process 500 .
- the publisher information may not be stored.
- the search criteria, list of publishers, offers, print ad content, and/or electronic tear sheet may be stored (e.g., on a memory of the advertisement system manager).
- publisher information may not include whether advertisers have a specified relationship, such as a previous advertising relationship, with the publisher. Specified relationships between advertisers and publishers may be identified when offers are presented to a publisher and subsequently rejected.
- the advertisement system manager may allow the publisher to specify advertisers that have a specified relationship with the publisher through an interface generated by the advertisement system manager.
- the interface may present a list of advertisers (e.g., that have used advertisement system manager, that have placed offers previously with the publisher and/or other publishers, etc.) to the publisher.
- the interface may allow the publisher to control the presentation of the list by, for example, allowing the publisher to sort and/or perform queries on the list.
- the publisher may select and/or otherwise provide (e.g., through a free-form text entry field) names of advertisers to designate as having the specified relationship.
- the publisher may also modify the designated relationship between the publisher and the advertiser. For example, the publisher can change the designation of a relationship from “a prior advertising relationship” exists to “no relationship”.
- a publisher may allow offers to be accepted from specified advertisers notwithstanding a specified relationship. For example, the publisher may receive frequent offers from a first advertiser and infrequent offers from a second advertiser. The publisher may allow offers through the advertisement system manager from the first advertiser, while inhibiting the second advertiser from providing offers through the advertisement system manager. As another example, the publisher may require (e.g., required by business rules, industry standards, or government regulations) a review of certain types of advertising prior to accepting an offer. The publisher may elect to designate these advertisers as having a specified relationship with the publisher to inhibit request for print ads through the advertisement system manager from these advertisers.
- determining whether the advertiser has a specified relationship to the publisher can include retrieving a list of top advertisers in a geographical region and determining if the advertiser is on the list and the publisher is in the geographical region. For example, the top 10 advertisers in the United States (e.g., in terms of dollars spent on advertising in a year) may be listed in a database accessible by the advertisement system manager. The advertisement system manager may determine if the advertiser is on the list and then identify which publishers have distribution in the region specified (e.g., United States). The advertisement system manager may then designate these identified publishers as having a specified relationship with the advertiser, i.e, deem a specified relationship. However, in some implementations the publisher can elect to allow offers from an advertiser notwithstanding their being on the top advertiser list.

However, in another implementation, at a time when an advertiser submits an offer to the publisher through the advertising system manager, the publisher can identify that advertiser as having a specified relationship with the publisher, and in that sense “blacklist” the advertiser. Other techniques for identifying which advertisers cannot transact with a publisher through the system are possible.

For example, the publisher may be presented a listing of available advertisers (e.g., advertisers that have registered with the system or advertisers that have previously placed offers) and identify for the advertising system manager those advertisers that are allowed to place ads with the publisher. In addition, the publisher may query a listing of available advertisers for specific advertisers. The system may then determine which advertisers are inhibited from placing ads and offers for ads.

Abstract
Publisher information, such as information about available advertising space, may be received from publishers. Advertisers may provide requests associated with a print ad and receive a list of publishers with available print ad space. The list of publishers may include at least one publisher having a specified relationship with the advertiser. The advertiser may provide an offer for placing the print ad in a publication of one or more publishers on the list and may be inhibited from placing an offer for the print ad with publishers having a specified relationship with the advertiser.
Description
- This application claims priority to pending U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/947,908, entitled “Electronic Advertising System,” filed on Jul. 3, 2007, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
- This invention relates to advertising.
- An advertiser desiring to place an advertisement in a printed publication (a “print ad”) can enter into an agreement with a publisher of the publication. The agreement generally includes the terms associated with the placement of the print ad. For example, if a print ad is to be placed in a newspaper, the agreement can specify the dates the print ad is to run, the section in the newspaper to place the print ad, the print ad size, and possibly other parameters. Because printed publications include manual processes, human error can lead to a print ad not running according to the terms agreed to between the advertiser and the publisher. For example, the print ad simply may not run at all, the wrong print ad content may be published, the print ad may be inserted into the wrong section of the newspaper and/or may be sized incorrectly. Conventionally, a publisher provides a tearsheet (i.e., a page on which the print ad was placed in the publication) to the advertiser as proof the print ad ran in the publication. Publishers typically have various existing relationships with certain advertisers. A single publisher of multiple publications may transact with advertisers separately for each publication, or may have a single account with an advertiser that relates to numerous publications.
- In general, in one aspect, the invention features techniques and apparatus whereby publisher information is received from publishers, where the publisher information includes information about available print ad space. A request associated with a print ad is received from an advertiser, and publishers with available print ad space are identified to the advertiser. The identified publishers include one or more of the publishers and at least one publisher having a specified relationship with the advertiser. Placement of the print ad of the advertiser with at least one publisher having the specified relationship with the advertiser is inhibited.
- Various implementations can include one or more of the following features. A determination can be made whether the advertiser has a specified relationship with one or more of the identified publishers. An offer can be received from the advertiser defining terms for placing the print ad in a publication of one or more of the identified publishers, including a publication of at least one publisher having the specified relationship with the advertiser. Determining whether the advertiser has the specified relationship with one or more of the identified publishers can include receiving an indication of the specified relationship from the publisher having the specified relationship with the advertiser after the publisher receives the offer from the advertiser.
- Inhibiting the advertiser from placing the print ad with a publisher having the specified relationship can include preventing the advertiser from submitting an offer for placing the print ad in a publication of the publisher with whom the advertiser has the specified relationship. In another example, inhibiting the advertiser can include preventing the advertiser from selecting the publisher from a list of the identified publishers presented to the advertiser when the advertiser is generating the offer. An interface can be provided to the advertiser that includes a list of the identified publishers including at least a portion of the publisher information for each publisher and a link for each identified publisher on the list that does not have the specified relationship with the advertiser. The advertiser can select a link to submit an offer for placing the print ad in a publication of the corresponding publisher. An identification of one or more advertisers having the specified relationship to the publisher can be received from at least some of the publishers. In this example, determining whether the advertiser has the specified relationship with one of the identified publishers can include comparing the advertiser to one or more advertisers identified by the publishers.
- The request from the advertiser can include search criteria related to publisher attributes and publishers can be identified at least partially based on the received search criteria. The specified relationship can include a previous advertising relationship with a publisher. One or more indicia can be presented to indicate which of the identified publishers has the specified relationship with the advertiser.
- A request can be received from the advertiser to submit an offer to the at least one publisher having the specified relationship with the advertiser, and, in response to the request, contact information for the at least one publisher can be presented to the advertiser such that the advertiser can contact the at least one publisher directly. An offer may be received from the advertiser defining terms for placing the print ad in a publication of one or more of the identified publishers, and a rejection of the offer and an identification that the advertiser has the specified relationship with the publisher can be received from at least one of the identified publishers to whom the offer is submitted. Inhibiting placement of the print ad of the advertiser with at least one publisher having the specified relationship can include selectively inhibiting placement based on offer criteria defined by the publisher with the specified relationship with the advertiser. An offer can be received from the advertiser that defines terms for placing the print ad in a publication of one or more of the identified publishers including a publication of at least one publisher having the specified relationship with the advertiser. Selectively inhibiting placement based on the offer criteria can include comparing the offer received from the advertiser having the specified relationship with the publisher to the offer criteria, and accepting the offer for placement if the offer criteria is satisfied and/or accepting the offer for placement if the offer criteria is not satisfied by the one or more other offers.
- In general, in another aspect, the invention features a system. The system includes a memory and an analysis module. The memory stores publisher information. The analysis module is adapted to receive publisher information from publishers and receive from an advertiser a request associated with a print ad. The publisher information includes information about available print ad space. The analysis module also is adapted to identify publishers with available print ad space, where the identified publishers includes one or more of the publishers from the plurality of publishers and at least one publisher having a specified relationship with the advertiser, and inhibit placement of the print ad of the advertiser with at least one publisher having the specified relationship with the advertiser.
- Various implementations can include one or more of the following features. The system can further include a presentation module adapted to present to the advertiser a list of the identified publishers. The analysis module can be further adapted to inhibit selection of at least one publisher on the list with the specified relationship with the advertiser.
- In general, in another aspect, the invention features a system including a means for receiving publisher information from publishers; means for receiving from an advertiser a request associated with a print ad; and means for identifying to the advertiser publishers with available print ad space, where publishers include one or more of the publishers and at least one publisher having a specified relationship with the advertiser. The publisher information includes information about available print ad space. Placement of the print ad of the advertiser with the at least one publisher having the specified relationship with the advertiser is inhibited.
- In general, in another aspect, the invention features techniques and apparatus whereby publisher information is received from publishers, the publisher information including information about available print ad space and an identification of advertisers from whom the publisher will entertain offers for ad placement. A request associated with a print ad is received from an advertiser, and publishers with available print ad space are identified to the advertiser. Placement of the print ad of the advertiser with any publisher that has not identified the advertiser as an advertiser from whom the publisher will entertain offers for ad placement is inhibited. Identifying to the advertiser publishers with available print ad space can include determining if the advertiser is an advertiser with whom publishers having available print ad space will entertain offers from, and excluding publishers from the identified publishers those publishers that will not entertain offers from the advertiser.
- Implementations of the invention can include none or some of the following advantages. An online marketplace is provided, for example, by way of a web site accessible over the Internet, that brings together multiple publishers and multiple advertisers. The online marketplace is provided by an advertising system manager, who can be compensated for placing prints ads with publishers from advertisers by way of the online marketplace. A publisher with an existing set of advertiser clientele can choose to use the online marketplace for advertisers other than some or all of those included in set. The publisher can thereby choose to carry on an existing relationship with an advertiser outside of the online marketplace, while still participating in the online marketplace in terms of forming new advertiser relationships.

An advertisement placed in a printed publication shall be referred to herein as a “print ad”. While reference is made to print ads, the systems and methods disclosed herein can be applied to other forms of sponsored content.
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example electronic printad management system 100. Thesystem 100 includesadvertisers 102 andpublishers 106. Apublisher 106 is an entity that publishes content (e.g., print ads) or places content (e.g., print ads) for publication with another entity. By way of example, reference is made to placing print ads in a publication. Other forms of content can be delivered and published in other forms of media in accordance with the methods, apparatus and systems disclosed herein. Anadvertiser 104 is an entity that desires to place a print ad in a printed publication. Theadvertiser 104 can be a direct (e.g., an advertising entity) or indirect supplier (e.g., a middle man) of the print ad. - In some implementations, the
advertiser 102 and one or more of thepublishers 106 may have a specified relationship, e.g., a previous advertising relationship. In one implementation, certain advertisers may be deemed to have a specified relationship with one or more of the publishers if the advertiser meets certain criteria, e.g., in terms of volumes of ads placed. That is, in one example, the top 300 advertisers in a region or nationally may be deemed to have a previous advertising relationship with certain publishers, whether or not that is actually the case. The significance of having a specified relationship with a publisher, or being deemed to have one, is discussed further below. - The system further includes an
advertising system manager 104. Theadvertising system manager 104 operates to bring theadvertisers 102 andpublishers 106 together by way, for example, of an online print ad marketplace, as is described further below. Acomputer network 110, such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects theadvertisers 102, theadvertising system manager 104 and thepublishers 106. - In one implementation, the
advertising system manager 104 includes ananalysis module 104 a and apresentation module 104 b, both of which can be of the form of executable instructions which are stored on a memory of the advertising system manager and executable by a processor of the advertising system manager. Theanalysis module 104 a can receive publisher information from a plurality of publishers; receive from an advertiser a request associated with a print ad; generate a list of publishers with available print ad space, where the list of publishers includes one or more of the publishers from the plurality of publishers and at least one publisher having a specified relationship with the advertiser; receive an offer from an advertiser specifying terms for placing a print ad in a publication of one or more of the publishers on the list, where the advertiser is inhibited from placing the print ad with the at least one publisher having the specified relationship with the advertiser; receive an acceptance from the publisher; receive print ad content from the advertiser and providing the print ad content to the publisher; and/or inhibit selection of at least one publisher on the list with the specified relationship with the advertiser. Thepresentation module 104 b can present to the advertiser the list of identified publishers and/or present indicia identifying one or more publishers with which the advertiser has a specified relationship. -
FIG. 2 is a flowchart showing anexample process 200 for providing an electronic advertising system 100 (e.g., an online marketplace) forpublishers 106 andadvertisers 104, wherein one or more of the steps in the process can be carried out by, for example, theadvertising system manager 104. Available print ad space is identified (step 202). For example, thepublishers 106 can provide information to theadvertising system manager 104 about available print ad space. The publisher information can include the name of the publication, the date or dates the publication is published, the location of the print ad space within the publication, the size and layout of the print ad space, whether the print ad will be run in black and white, color or either, and/or other information the publisher desires to provide to market their available print ad space. - Information associated with the publishers of the available print ad space is provided to advertisers (Step 204). For example, the
advertising system manager 104 can provide an online marketplace in which publisher information provided by thepublishers 106 is made available to theadvertisers 102. In one implementation, the online marketplace is a web site. In this implementation, anadvertiser 102 can be presented with a graphical user interface (GUI) through which theadvertiser 102 can input certain choices about publishers with whom they would like to place ads. For example, the GUI can include checkboxes, drop-down menus, radio controls, data entry fields, and/or other user input controls or combinations thereof. In one implementation, the web site includes search capabilities. For example, if anadvertiser 102 would like to search for a newspaper in a particular geographic location, theadvertiser 102 can use the search capabilities to identify one or more newspapers meeting the advertiser's 102 geographic criteria, although a search query can be based on different and/or other search criteria as well. - An advertiser selects one or more publishers that the advertiser is interested in placing a print ad with (step 206). For example, using the web site provided by the
advertising system manager 104, theadvertiser 102 can provide input to the advertising system manager to choose one ormore publishers 106 that theadvertiser 102 is interested in placing ads with based on publisher information included on the web site. By way of illustrative example, consider anadvertiser 102 that is interested in placing a print ad in a newspaper. In this example thepublishers 106 are newspapers. Theadvertiser 102 can choosecertain newspaper publishers 106, for example, based on factors such as geography, circulation size, ad size availability, section availability and other criteria. To the extent that apublisher 106 has provided publisher information relevant to these factors to theadvertising system manager 104, theadvertiser 102 has access to this information, through theadvertising system manager 104, when choosing thenewspaper publishers 106. - The advertiser creates an offer for one or more print ads with the selected publishers (step 207) and can submit the offer to the advertising system manager. The offer can include the specific terms associated with the advertisement including the price that the advertiser is willing to pay for placing the ad. For example, the
advertiser 102 can select various parameters related to the desired advertising, such as the day(s)-of-week, desired newspaper section and ad size for each chosennewspaper publisher 106. Theadvertiser 102 can input a “bid amount” (e.g., a price theadvertiser 102 is willing to pay to place an ad of the selected ad size in the chosen newspaper section on the selected day or days of the week). The advertiser's input, including the bid amount, can constitute the advertiser's “offer”. - In
step 208, offers are submitted to corresponding publishers. For example, theadvertising system manager 104 can submit the advertiser's offers to the correspondingpublishers 106. In some implementations, submitting the offers can include sending an electronic message to the publishers that includes information about the offers. In some implementations, submitting the offers can include making the information about the offers available on a portion of a web site maintained by theadvertising system manager 104, which may be accessible only to appropriate publishers. In some implementations, submitting the offers can include making the offers available on a particular portion of the web site and notifying the appropriate publishers of the availability of the offers by electronic message. Eachpublisher 106 can respond by either accepting or declining the offer. In one implementation, apublisher 106 can decline an offer but initiate an online (or offline) dialog with theadvertiser 102 as to why the offer was not accepted and the two parties can attempt to reach an agreement satisfactory to both parties. - If an offer is accepted (“Yes” branch of decision step 209), the print ad content can be submitted (step 210). For example, the
advertiser 102 can electronically submit corresponding print ad content to thepublisher 106. Alternatively, the advertiser can supply print ad content with the offer. In one implementation, theadvertiser 102 uploads an electronic file including the print ad content to theadvertising system manager 104 and theadvertising system manager 104 provides the electronic file to the publisher 106 (step 212). - If an offer is declined (“No” branch of decision step 209), a check can be made to determine if publisher feedback has been received (step 211). If so (“Yes” branch of decision step 211), an optional session between the advertiser and publisher can be initiated (step 216), during which, for example, the advertiser and publisher can continue negotiating terms associated with an ad placement. If no publisher feedback has been received (“No” branch of decision step 211), the
process 200 can terminate (step 220). For example, if the publisher provides no comments or feedback to theadvertiser 102 as to why the offer was declined, then the process terminates. However, if thepublisher 106 does provide feedback to theadvertiser 102, theadvertiser 102 may be motivated to provide a revised offer (“Yes” branch of decision step 222), and the process returns todecision step 208. Otherwise, if theadvertiser 102 does not provide a revised offer (“No” branch of decision step 222), the process terminates (Step 220). - Step 214 includes submission of a compliance report (e.g., an electronic tearsheet). For example, once the
publisher 106 has run the ad (e.g., run the ad in the desired section in the newspaper on the selected date), thepublisher 106 can provide proof that the ad ran to theadvertising system manager 104. In one implementation, an electronic tearsheet can be uploaded to the electronic advertising system as proof that the ad ran according to agreed-upon terms. The electronic tearsheet can be an electronic file that includes an image of the ad as placed within the publication and can include enough information to show that the ad ran in the desired section of the newspaper on the selected date and according to any other specifications of the advertiser, e.g., ad size, ad color, font size, etc. In one implementation, the electronic tearsheet is a PDF file including a scanned representation of the page of the publication on which the ad ran. - Once an electronic tearsheet is uploaded by the
publisher 106 to theadvertising system manager 104, theadvertising system manager 104 can provide the electronic tearsheet to theadvertiser 102. For example, theadvertising system manager 104 can forward the electronic tearsheet to the publisher by electronic message, by making the electronic tearsheet accessible in a portion of a web site to which the publisher has access, through a combination of providing access and sending an electronic messages, etc. - Once the
advertising system manager 104 determines that the ad ran (e.g., by receiving an electronic tearsheet), theadvertising system manager 104 can collect a bid amount from theadvertiser 102 and transmit a publisher's share of the collected bid amount to the publisher 106 (Step 216). - In some implementations, an
advertiser 102 can challenge the compliance report, i.e., the electronic tearsheet, within a specified period of time after the electronic tearsheet is uploaded. In particular, theadvertiser 102 can, in some implementations, send a challenge message to theadvertising system manager 104. Theadvertising system manager 104 may forward the message to thepublisher 106, or theadvertising system manager 104 may resolve any challenge raised by the advertiser directly (e.g., in an automated manner, or with human involvement, or with a combination of both). In some implementations, if it is determined that the ad was not run according to agreed-upon parameters, the bid amount may not be collected from theadvertiser 102, and neither theadvertising system manager 104 nor thepublisher 106 may receive payment. A process for challenging a compliance report is described in further detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/753,407, entitled “Processing Electronic Tearsheets”, filed by Leader on May 24, 2007, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. - In some implementations, the
advertising system manager 104 automates many if not all steps in the process of either placing ads (e.g., steps taken by an advertiser 102) or selling ad space (e.g., steps taken by a publisher 106). For example, theadvertising system manager 104 can automatically provide matches betweenadvertisers 102 andpublishers 106 based on their respective inputs (e.g., the advertisers' offers and the publishers' information). Further, theadvertisers 102 can be provided with an electronic mechanism for uploading and transmitting the ad content to thepublishers 106. Thepublishers 106 can be provided with an electronic mechanism for proving the ad was placed as agreed (e.g., in the form of an electronic tearsheet). Once both parties are satisfied their terms of the agreement (subject in some implementations to mediation by the advertising system manager 104), payment (e.g., the bid amount) can be automatically collected from theadvertiser 102 and the publisher can be provided with the publisher's share of the bid amount. - Advantageously, the
advertiser 102 is provided with a central mechanism (e.g., the advertising system manager's website) to access available print ad space of, for example, multiple publishers. Correspondingly, thepublishers 106 can be provided with a marketplace for their available print ad space. The payment mechanism (e.g., a bid system) can enable theadvertiser 102 to only pay what theadvertiser 102 decides to pay, and thepublisher 106 can choose to accept only offers that are most desirous to thepublisher 106. Referring now toFIGS. 3A-D , example GUIs of an example web site configured to implement the electronic advertising system provided by theadvertising system manager 104 are shown. The GUIs shown in these figures are directed to theadvertisers 102 and can be used to receive the advertisers' offers. These GUIs are illustrative examples, and other configurations can be used. - Referring particularly to
FIG. 3A , aGUI 300 is shown for one particular example whereby anadvertiser 102 is creating offers to place print ads withnewspaper publishers 106. Data fields 302 and 304 are provided wherein theadvertiser 102 can input a name for a print ad campaign being created (i.e., a set of offers) and the desired start and end dates for the ad campaign. - The
advertiser 102 can choose to either search for names of newspapers by location using thesearch input field 306, or can enter a newspaper name into thedata field 308. Other controls are provided for theadvertiser 102 to search, for example, newspapers per the search criteria entered in the data fields, or by use of a drop down menu. A list of newspapers is provided to theadvertiser 102, and in this example, theadvertiser 102 has selected the first eight newspapers from thelist 310. Adata box 312 shown to the right of the list clearly identifies for theadvertiser 102 the names of the newspapers selected and includes a “remove” control, whereby theadvertiser 102 can select to remove one or more from the list. Asecond data box 314 provides additional information to theadvertiser 102 about certain of the selected newspapers. Theadvertiser 102 is notified that some of the newspapers selected are a part of packages that offer discount rates if the advertiser bids on the whole package. Suggested packages to add to the list of selected newspapers are proposed to theadvertiser 102. Near the bottom of theGUI 300control buttons 316 are provided for theadvertiser 102 to cancel or continue with inputting information to create offers. In this example, theadvertiser 102 selects to continue. - Referring now to
FIG. 3B , anext GUI 320 is shown that is presented to theadvertiser 102 upon selecting to continue, as described above. Each of the newspapers selected by theadvertiser 102 using theprevious GUI 300 is listed beside a set of user controls. Theadvertiser 102 can employ the user controls to input specifics about their offer for eachparticular publisher 106, i.e., newspaper. In this implementation, theadvertiser 102 is prompted to input thesection 322 of the newspaper in which to run the print ad, thead size 324, and the issues 326 (i.e., for a daily publication, the day(s) of the week). Theadvertiser 102 is also prompted to input a bid amount 328. A column to the right of the bid amount shows a calculated maximumweekly cost 330, based on the bid amount and the number of days selected. - A
data box 332 can include multiple pieces of information. In this implementation, thedata box 332 includes information about “overbidding”, a practice that can ensure advertisers get full use of their advertising budget. Because one or more of the advertiser's offers may not be accepted by publishers, the advertiser is recommended to create offers having a total bid amount greater than the advertiser's desired maximum weekly budget. However, only the first publishers that accept the advertiser's pending offers may secure the potential business with the advertiser. That is, a first publisher to respond to the advertiser's offers will likely be able to accept some or all of the advertiser's offers before the advertiser's maximum weekly budget is met. A last publisher to respond may not be able to accept any offers, if the advertiser's maximum weekly budget is already met by the earlier acceptance of offers by other publishers. A natural by-product of overbidding is a tacit incentive for publishers to respond quickly to advertisers offers and to minimize negotiating with advertisers, as a delay in acceptance due to negotiations can mean the offer will not longer be open for acceptance. -
Control buttons 334 allow theadvertiser 102 to go back to theprevious GUI 300, continue or “save and close”. In this example, theadvertiser 102 chooses to continue and is presented with theGUI 340 shown inFIG. 3C . Theadvertiser 102 can use theGUI 340 to upload files including the print ad content theadvertiser 102 desires to place in one or more of the selected newspapers. In this implementation, data fields 342 are provided wherein theadvertiser 102 can provide information for thepublishers 106, including the advertiser's name, product/service name, product/service description, and a description of persons who may find the ad content controversial or offensive.Controls 346 are provided for theadvertiser 102 to indicate whether they plan to update their ad and/or use different ad files for different issues. For example, theadvertiser 102 may upload one ad file for use in issues published from Monday to Friday and a second ad file for use in issues published on the weekend.Controls 348 allow theadvertiser 102 to go back to theprevious GUI 320, continue or save and close. - In this example, the
advertiser 102 chooses to continue and is presented with theGUI 350 shown inFIG. 3D . Theadvertiser 102 is presented with a summary of the ad campaign theadvertiser 102 has created, including a summary of the advertiser's offers and the ad content uploaded in the ad files. Theadvertiser 102 can select “edit”controls advertiser 102 is satisfied with the ad campaign as shown, theadvertiser 102 can select the “start my campaign now”button 356 to initiate consideration of the offers by the correspondingpublishers 106. In this implementation, theadvertiser 102 is notified by email from theadvertising system manager 104 asnewspaper publishers 106 respond to the advertiser's offers. - In one implementation, an “in progress” campaign is saved automatically. For example, if an advertiser navigates away from the summary review page without selecting “Start My Campaign Now”, the campaign information input by the advertiser is saved. The
advertising system manager 104 may be automatically alerted to have a salesperson follow-up with the advertiser to determine whether the advertiser has questions or concerns or would like to activate their ad campaign. - Referring now to
FIGS. 4A-B , example GUIs directed to thepublishers 106 are shown. These GUIs are illustrative examples, and other configurations can be used.FIG. 4A shows aGUI 400 including example content directed to aspecific publisher 106, in this example, The Tribune. Thepublisher 106 is provided a summary of offers received 402, e.g., “7 new offers”, and provided a link to another web page to view the offers (seeFIG. 4B ). Thepublisher 106 is provided a summary of ad materials forreview 404, e.g., “3 new ads” and a link to download and view the ad materials. A link to a list ofissues 406 is provided to view and edit accepted ads. A summary of tearsheets needed is provided 408, e.g., “7 tearsheets needed”, and a link to upload a PDF tearsheet. A link to viewing reports 410 is provided, whereby thepublisher 106 can view reports of all ads thepublisher 106 has accepted. In this implementation, thepublisher 106 can click on a button to view a list of offers received to place print ads in the publisher's publication. - Referring to
FIG. 4B , aGUI 420 is shown that is presented upon theadvertiser 102 clicking the view offers 402 link shown inFIG. 4A . Each offer received is detailed and anaction column 422 is provided. Thepublisher 106 can input selections into controls and data fields included in theaction column 422 to accept an offer, decline an offer and/or to provide reasons for declining an offer and an optional message to theadvertiser 102. - As described above, once the
publisher 106 proves the ad was placed as per the terms agreed to between thepublisher 106 and theadvertiser 102, theadvertising system manager 104 automatically collects the bid amount from theadvertiser 102. For example, in one implementation, theadvertising system manager 104 automatically charges the bid amount to an account theadvertiser 102 has with theadvertising system manager 104. Theadvertising system manager 104 then transmits the publisher's share of the bid amount to the publisher 106 (e.g., credits the publisher's account) and retains the balance as payment to theadvertising system manager 104. For example, in one implementation, the publisher's share is 85% of the bid amount. However, it should be understand a different percent or a different manner of calculating the publisher's share can be used and this is but one example. - Because payment to both the
advertising system manager 104 and thepublisher 106 does not occur until thepublisher 106 has proved the ad has been placed, for example, by uploading an electronic tearsheet, the sooner the electronic tearsheet is uploaded, the sooner the bid amount can be collected. To encourage thepublisher 106 to promptly upload the electronic tearsheet, the amount of the publisher's share can be made contingent on when the electronic tearsheet is uploaded. That is, if the electronic tearsheet is uploaded within a first period of time after the ad is placed, then the publisher's share includes a base amount and a first bonus. By way of illustrative example, if the electronic tearsheet is uploaded within 24 hours of the ad being placed, then the publisher's share includes a base amount of 85% of the bid amount and a first bonus of 5% of the bid amount. - In another implementation, different bonus amounts can be provided for different upload periods. For example, if the electronic tearsheet is not uploaded within the first period of time, but is uploaded within a second period of time, then the publisher's share includes a base amount and a second bonus, where the second bonus is less than the first bonus. By way of illustration, using the example from above, if the electronic tearsheet is uploaded after 24 hours but before 48 hours of the ad being placed, then the publisher's share increases from 85% to 88% of the bid amount, i.e., a 3% second bonus.
- In another implementation, if the electronic tearsheet is not uploaded within a final period of time, then no payment is collected from the
advertiser 102 and neither theadvertising system manager 104 nor thepublisher 106 get paid for the ad, even if the ad was placed according to the terms agreed to by thepublisher 106 and theadvertiser 102. - In the above example, the publishers performance is monitored based on the time it takes a publisher to upload an electronic tearsheet. However, in other implementations, different factors can be monitored as indications of good performance. For example, other performance factors can include: time to respond to new offers; placement quality of print ads; percentage of print ad placements that are correctly executed; an advertiser satisfaction rating of interaction with the publisher and/or publisher ad performance. Rating the publishers performance based on one or more of the above factors, or other factors, can be systematic and automated, can be advertiser-specified or can be qualitatively judged by the
advertising system manager 104. - In some implementations, a publisher may wish to inhibit specified advertisers from submitting offers through the advertisement system manager to place ads with the publisher and would prefer to transact directly with such advertisers. For example, if the publisher has a pre-existing business relationship with the advertiser and has previously placed one or more ads on behalf of the advertiser, the publisher may prefer to carry on business with that advertiser outside of the electronic print
ad management system 100. The advertiser may not, however, have a previous advertising relationship with other publishers using thesystem 100. Accordingly, excluding the advertiser from thesystem 100 altogether may not be a suitable solution. Accordingly, to allow both the publisher and the advertiser to use thesystem 100, just not to transact with one another, the advertiser can be inhibited from placing print ads with the publisher through thesystem 100, although be able to place print ads with other publishers through the system. In effect, the publisher “blacklists” certain advertiser with whom the publisher has a specified relationship, usually a pre-existing advertising relationship although other criteria can be employed. -
FIG. 5A illustrates aprocess 500 for managing print ad placement. Publisher information is received from one or more publishers (Step 505). For example, referring to the electronic printad management system 100, thepublishers 106 can transmit over thenetwork 110 publisher information to theadvertisement system manager 104. Theadvertisement system manager 104 can provide an interface to facilitate receipt of the publisher information. The publisher information can include information about available print ad space in the publisher's publication(s). In one implementation, the publisher information can include information about advertisers that have a specified relationship (e.g., previous advertising relationship) with the publisher, i.e., the publisher's blacklist. - The publisher information (or at least a portion thereof) can be stored (Step 510). For example, after the
advertisement system manager 104 receives the publisher information, the publisher information can be stored on a memory coupled to theadvertising system manager 104. - A request can be received from an advertiser associated with the placement of a print ad (Step 515). The request can be received through an interface provided by the advertisement system manager. The interface can include fields that facilitate the receipt of requests allowing requests to be received in a uniform and consistent format. Increasing the uniformity and consistency of the requests can facilitate analysis of offers by a publisher, as similar offers may be more easily compared.
- If the advertiser has specified the search criteria in the request (“Yes” branch of decision step 520), then publishers with available print ad space that satisfy the search criteria are identified (Step 522). Otherwise, publishers with available print ad space are identified (Step 530). For example, an
advertiser 102 may specify search criteria related to the print ad requested, such as geographical location of publication, type of publication (e.g., newspaper, online provider, magazine, etc.), length of print ad, etc. An interface generated by theadvertisement system manager 104 can facilitate entry of search criteria by theadvertiser 102. For example, the interface can allow an advertiser to select search criteria from available options. - If search criteria has been specified, in one example the advertisement system manager can search a database including publisher information to identify publishers that have available print ad space and satisfy the search criteria. As another example, a listing of the
publishers 106 available through theadvertisement system manager 104 can be generated and then publisher information provided by the publishers can be analyzed to identify publishers that satisfy the search criteria. - A list of the publishers identified in either
steps - A determination can be made as to whether the advertiser has a known specified relationship with one or more publishers included on the list (Step 540). A “known” specified relationship is a specified relationship that is known to the entity generating the list, for example, the
advertising system manager 104. In one implementation, publisher information for the publishers with which offers for print ads may be placed through the advertisement system manager can be analyzed to determine if a specified relationship, such as a previous advertising relationship, exists with the advertiser. As another example, a determination may be made only with respect to the publishers on the list, as to whether one or more have a specified relationship with the advertiser. In one implementation, the “blacklist” of each publisher on the list is analyzed to determine whether the advertiser is included on the blacklist. - If the advertiser has a known specified relationship with one or more publishers, then these publishers can be identified with indicia (Step 545). Indicia can include, for example, an image, text (e.g., Not Available, Pre-existing Relationship, etc.), color, and/or highlighting. The indicia can be presented to an advertiser proximate a publisher name on the list. As another example, the name of a publisher on a list can be presented in a different color than other text and/or images on the list. Other forms of identification or exclusion can be used.
- The list can be presented to the advertiser (Step 550). The list may be presented through an interface generated by the user. The interface may list at least a portion of publisher information, such as publisher name, available space, etc. The interface may allow an advertiser to control the display of the list, for example, by allowing the advertiser to sort the list and/or perform queries on the list.
- Ad placement with publishers having a known specified relationship to the advertiser can be inhibited (Step 555). Publishers may inhibit offers from advertisers with a specified relationship, such as a previous advertising relationship, to separately manage advertisers with which the publisher has a direct relationship. However, the same advertiser may be allowed to provide offers to other publishers. In addition, a portion of the publishers with the specified relationship to the advertiser may elect to allow the advertiser to submit offers through the advertisement system manager.
- Inhibiting ad placement with a particular publisher can include inhibiting selection of the publisher through an interface generated by the advertisement system manager. For example, the list may not include link (e.g., through which an offer may be submitted) for the publisher with the specified relationship. As another example, the list may present contact information for the publisher with the specified relationship when the publisher is selected by the advertiser, rather than presenting a link through which an offer may be submitted. The presentation of the contact information is to encourage to the advertiser to contact the publisher directly to place an ad with the publisher.
- In another implementation, inhibiting ad placement comes further downstream in the process. That is, the advertiser is permitted to submit an offer to place an ad with the publisher, but the offer is automatically rejected by the publisher since the advertiser is on the publisher's blacklist.
- Referring again to
FIG. 5A , an offer can be received from the advertiser (Step 560). The offer can include offer terms or parameters, such as bid amount (e.g., amount the advertiser is willing to pay for placing the print ad), publication time, size of print ad requested, content of print ad (e.g., text, images, video, etc.). The advertisement system manager may generate an interface through which the offer is received. The interface may allow offer terms to be provided by the advertiser and transmitted to the advertisement system manager. - The offer is transmitted to the publisher (Step 560). For example, the advertisement system manager may transmit a message (e.g., email, XML message, etc.) to the publisher with the offer. As another example, the advertisement system manager presents the offer to the publisher through an interface. When the publisher accesses the advertisement system manager, the offer, other pending offers, previous offers, etc. may be presented on the interface. In one implementation, to inhibit ad placement with a publisher with whom the advertiser has a known specified relationship, the advertisement system manager can automatically reject the offer on behalf of the publisher, in which case the offer is not transmitted to the publisher.
- A response to the offer can be received from the publisher (Step 565). For example, the publisher may accept, decline, and/or present a counteroffer to the offer provided by the advertiser. The response may be received through an interface generated by the advertisement system manager. The interface may present available options for responding to an offer, from which the publisher selects a response.
- Referring now to
FIG. 5B , if the offer is not accepted (“No” branch of decision step 570), a determination can be made as to whether the publisher has indicated that advertiser has a specified relationship with the publisher. That is, has the publisher rejected the offer and added the advertiser to the publisher's blacklist? If so, (“Yes” branch of decision step 575), then the advertiser will be inhibited from future ad placement with the publisher. For example, when an advertiser attempts to provide an offer with this publisher, the offer may be immediately rejected and a message may be provided to the user that indicates that the offer was not allowed through the system for this publisher. As another example, an offer may be inhibited by inhibiting selection of the publisher (e.g., graying out the publisher name, dead link, etc.) when an advertiser provides a requests related to print ads. - If that is not the case, i.e., the offer was rejected for other reasons (“No” branch of decision step 575), then the advertiser can be notified of the rejection (Step 582). For example, the message may be an email. The message may be presented through the interface generated by the advertisement system manager. The message may include reasons for the rejection provided by the publisher (e.g., specified relationship exists, price to low, space unavailable, etc.).
- If an offer has been accepted (“Yes” branch of decision step 570), then print ad content may be received from the advertiser (Step 585). For example, the advertiser may email the print ad content to an address specified on the interface generated by the advertisement system manager. As another example, the advertiser may upload the print ad content to the advertisement system manager. The print ad content may include an electronic version of the advertisement the advertiser is requesting publication.
- The print ad content can be transmitted to the publisher (Step 587). For example, the print ad content may be automatically downloaded to a predetermined memory by the advertisement system manager. As another example, a link to the print ad content may be provided through the interface generated by the advertisement system manager and the publisher may download the print ad content using the link. In addition, a message may be transmitted to the publisher with the print ad content.
- After the publisher has placed the ad, an electronic tearsheet may be received from the publisher (Step 589). The electronic tearsheet can confirm placement at a placement time of the print ad in a publication according to the accepted offer terms.
- A bid amount can be collected from the advertiser (Step 592). For example, the advertisement system manager may manage the receipt of, for example, a wire transfer or electronic fund transfer to an account (e.g., PayPal account, bank account, etc.) of the advertisement system manager from the advertiser. The publisher's share of the bid amount is provided to the publisher (Step 594). For example, the advertisement system manager may automatically electronically transfer at least a portion of the bid amount to the publisher. In addition, the advertisement system manager may automatically deduct the portion of the bid amount payable to the advertisement system manager for managing the transaction.
-
Process 500 can be implemented byexample system 100 or similar systems. In addition, various operations may be added, deleted, modified, or reordered inprocess 500. For example, the publisher information may not be stored. As another example, the search criteria, list of publishers, offers, print ad content, and/or electronic tear sheet may be stored (e.g., on a memory of the advertisement system manager). In some implementations, publisher information may not include whether advertisers have a specified relationship, such as a previous advertising relationship, with the publisher. Specified relationships between advertisers and publishers may be identified when offers are presented to a publisher and subsequently rejected. - In addition, the advertisement system manager may allow the publisher to specify advertisers that have a specified relationship with the publisher through an interface generated by the advertisement system manager. For example, the interface may present a list of advertisers (e.g., that have used advertisement system manager, that have placed offers previously with the publisher and/or other publishers, etc.) to the publisher. The interface may allow the publisher to control the presentation of the list by, for example, allowing the publisher to sort and/or perform queries on the list. The publisher may select and/or otherwise provide (e.g., through a free-form text entry field) names of advertisers to designate as having the specified relationship. The publisher may also modify the designated relationship between the publisher and the advertiser. For example, the publisher can change the designation of a relationship from “a prior advertising relationship” exists to “no relationship”. In addition, a publisher may allow offers to be accepted from specified advertisers notwithstanding a specified relationship. For example, the publisher may receive frequent offers from a first advertiser and infrequent offers from a second advertiser. The publisher may allow offers through the advertisement system manager from the first advertiser, while inhibiting the second advertiser from providing offers through the advertisement system manager. As another example, the publisher may require (e.g., required by business rules, industry standards, or government regulations) a review of certain types of advertising prior to accepting an offer. The publisher may elect to designate these advertisers as having a specified relationship with the publisher to inhibit request for print ads through the advertisement system manager from these advertisers.
- In addition, determining whether the advertiser has a specified relationship to the publisher can include retrieving a list of top advertisers in a geographical region and determining if the advertiser is on the list and the publisher is in the geographical region. For example, the top 10 advertisers in the United States (e.g., in terms of dollars spent on advertising in a year) may be listed in a database accessible by the advertisement system manager. The advertisement system manager may determine if the advertiser is on the list and then identify which publishers have distribution in the region specified (e.g., United States). The advertisement system manager may then designate these identified publishers as having a specified relationship with the advertiser, i.e, deem a specified relationship. However, in some implementations the publisher can elect to allow offers from an advertiser notwithstanding their being on the top advertiser list.

FIGS. 6A-F illustrate example interfaces generated by theadvertisement system manager 104 as illustrated insystem 100. Anadvertiser 102 may access theadvertisement system manager 104 through, for example, a web site on the Internet as previously discussed above. In one example, the advertiser may log on to the system (e.g., by providing a user name and/or password) so that a customized interface (e.g., advertiser specific interface) may be presented to the user. Theinterface 601 may present, to the advertiser,fields 602 for the advertiser to enter search criteria such as publisher name, geographical location of publication, circulation, section, ad size, type of publication (e.g., newspaper), and/or other appropriate criteria, seeFIG. 6A . The fields may be presented as fields that allow an advertiser to enter free-form text, drop-down fields, buttons, links, etc. Theinterface 601 also includes a link 604 that allows the advertiser to view all publishers and/or all publishers with available print ad space. - The results of application of the search criteria may be presented in a
portion 606 of theinterface 601. Theportion 606 may include the name of the publisher, circulation, schedule, and/or other publisher information. The interface may allow presentation of the information in theportion 606 to be controlled, such as by allowing the information in theportion 606 to be sorted bypublisher information categories 607. Theportion 606 may also includeindicia 608 to identify publishers with which the advertiser has a specified relationship. Alink 610 which may present contact information in a separate window, for example, may be provided for publishers with the specified relationship to the advertiser. In addition, theinterface 601 includes links 612, which may be selected by an advertiser, to provide an offer to the selected publisher. -
FIG. 6B illustrates an example of theinterface 620 presented when an offer is submitted for a publisher with which the advertiser has a specified relationship. Theinterface 620 may be a new window presented to the advertiser. Theinterface 620 includes messages, such as amessage 622 of the specified relationship and/or messages from thepublisher 624. The publisher using the interface may customize themessage 624 from the publisher. For example, the same and/or different messages may be provided to advertisers with the same and/or different specified relationships. - In one implementation, an
advertiser 102 can contest the designation of having a specified relationship with the publisher by contacting the publisher, such as by sending amessage 626 to the publisher. The advertiser may also send other messages, such as questions, to the publisher via amessaging portion 626 on the interface. - In some implementations, placement of an ad may be selectively inhibited. For example, if a publisher has an available ad space and receives offers that the publisher finds unacceptable, then the publisher may allow placement of ads from one or more advertisers with the specified relationship with the publisher, who may or may not have been previously inhibited from placing ads with the publisher. The publisher may elect to temporarily, for a specified period of time, or until the published elects to reinstitute the inhibition, allow the placement of ads from these advertisers. The publisher may specify offer criteria (e.g., receive more than a particular number of offers, receive more than a specified number of offers over a specified amount, etc.) that when applied automatically inhibits placement of ads (e.g., temporarily) from advertisers with the specified relationship with the publisher and that have been previously inhibited from placing ads with the publisher. When the specified offer criteria is not satisfied, at least a portion of previously excluded advertisers (e.g., with the specified relationship) may be automatically allowed to place ads with the publisher.
-
FIG. 6C illustrates an example of theinterface 630 presented when an offer is submitted for a publisher package in which the advertiser has a specified relationship with at least one of the publishers in the package. Theinterface 630 may present amessage 632 regarding the specified relationship and/or anidentification 634 of the publisher in the package with which the advertiser has the specified relationship. The interface may include aportion 636 through which messages may be sent to publishers of the package and/or with publishers that have been identified as having a specified relationship with the advertiser. - Once the advertiser has provided an offer with offer terms, such as the duration of the print ad, the publication time of the print ad, etc, the offer may be provided to the publisher.
FIG. 6D illustrates an example of an interface presented to a publisher that includes offers. Theinterface 640 includes one ormore offers 642 and/or offerterms 644. Theinterface 640 may also includeavailable response options 646 to the offer by the publisher. As illustrated, the publisher may accept, waive, inhibit one time and accept at a later time, decline, or take no action. In addition, an indication or label of the relationship between the advertiser and the publisher may be provided through afield 648. Theinterface 640 may also allow messages from the publisher to the advertiser (e.g., requesting clarification of terms or print ad content, submitted counteroffer, etc.) to be transmitted by, as illustrated, selecting abutton 650 on the interface. Theinterface 640 may include currently pending offers and/or past offers. -
FIG. 6E illustrates an example of aninterface 655 through which the publisher may indicate whether advertisers have a specified relationship with the publisher. The interface may present thename 657 of advertisers that have been identified as having a specified relationship (e.g., the publisher may identify them prior to or after receiving an offer). Theinterface 655 may present a message from the advertisement system manager relating to permissions of the identified advertisers. For example, the advertisement system manager may require that a previous advertising relationship existed for a specified period of time for identification of an advertiser as having a specified relationship. Theinterface 655 may also include a message that the advertiser will be presented if the advertiser attempts to provide an offer or provides an offer to the publisher (e.g., seemessage 624 presented ininterface 620 inFIG. 6B ). Theinterface 620 may also include a portion in which offer criteria may be provided by a publisher. When the offer criteria is satisfied, for example, offers from advertisers with a specified relationship with the publisher may be inhibited, and when offer criteria is not satisfied previously excluded advertisers may be allowed to place an ad with the publisher. For example, the publisher may include criteria such as inhibiting placement of ads from previously excluded advertisers when: greater than a specified number of ads are received for available ad space, an offer is received that includes a bid that is a specified percentage higher than the next higher bid, etc. The publisher may apply the criteria to all available ad space or to specified available ad space. The publisher may also select which advertiser(s), of the advertisers that are known to have a specified relationship with the publisher, will be allowed to place ads due to the criteria not being satisfied (e.g., failure to satisfy criteria may allow specified previously excluded advertisers to place ads while continuing to inhibit other previously excluded advertisers). Theinterface 655 may include afield 663 that allows the same message to be presented to other advertisers identified as having the specified relationship. -
FIG. 6F illustrates aninterface 670 in which three advertisers have been identified as having the specified relationship with a publisher. Theinterface 670 includesnames 672 of advertisers that have been identified and a relationship status 674 (e.g., “excluded” from system for the publisher when offers from the advertiser will be inhibited to the publisher). Theinterface 670 may allow editing through alink 676 of the message automatically presented to the user when the user attempts to offer or provides an offers to the publisher. The interface also includes alink 678 to change the relationship status to allow advertisers (e.g., previously excluded) to submit offers through the advertisement system manager. The interface also presents thedefault message 680 presented to advertisers with which the publisher has a specified relationship, when these advertisers attempt to submit an offer and an advertiserspecific message 681 has not been provided by the publisher. - It should be understood that although a publisher's “blacklist” has been referred to above, a list is not necessarily required per se. That is, as already discussed, in one implementation, a publisher can provide a blacklist to the advertising system manager and request that advertisers included on the list be inhibited from placing ads with the publisher through the advertising system manager. However, in another implementation, at a time when an advertiser submits an offer to the publisher through the advertising system manager, the publisher can identify that advertiser as having a specified relationship with the publisher, and in that sense “blacklist” the advertiser. Other techniques for identifying which advertisers cannot transact with a publisher through the system are possible. In some implementations, rather than providing a listing of advertisers inhibited from placing ads, the publisher may provide a listing of advertisers that are allowed to place offers for ads with the publisher, i.e., a “whitelist”. For example, the publisher may be presented a listing of available advertisers (e.g., advertisers that have registered with the system or advertisers that have previously placed offers) and identify for the advertising system manager those advertisers that are allowed to place ads with the publisher. In addition, the publisher may query a listing of available advertisers for specific advertisers. The system may then determine which advertisers are inhibited from placing ads and offers for ads.
