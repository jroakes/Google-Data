Definitions
- the present systems, devices, and methods generally relate to beam combining and particularly relate to beam combining within laser projectors in wearable heads-up displays.
- a projector is an optical device that projects or shines a pattern of light onto another object (e.g., onto a surface of another object, such as onto a projection screen) in order to display an image or video on that other object.
- a projector necessarily includes a light source, and a laser projector is a projector for which the light source comprises at least one laser.
- the at least one laser is temporally modulated to provide a pattern of laser light and usually at least one controllable mirror is used to spatially distribute the modulated pattern of laser light over a two-dimensional area of another object. The spatial distribution of the modulated pattern of laser light produces an image at or on the other object.
- the at least one controllable mirror may include: a single digital micro (e.g., a microelectromechanical system (“MEMS”) based digital micromirror) that is controllably rotatable or deformable in two dimensions, or two digital micromirrors that are each controllably rotatable or deformable about a respective dimension, or a digital light processing (“DLP”) chip comprising an array of digital micromirrors.
- MEMS microelectromechanical system
- DLP digital light processing
- a conventional laser projector comprising a RGB laser module with a red laser diode, a green laser diode, and a blue laser diode
- the individual red laser beam, green laser beam, and blue laser beam may be combined into an aggregate laser beam such that each laser beam impinges on the at least one controllable mirror with substantially the same spot size (the two dimensional area of the cross section of the laser beam at any point along the length of the beam) and with substantially the same rate of convergence (so that all laser beams will continue to have substantially the same spot size as they propagate away from the laser projector towards, e.g., a projection screen).
- a head-mounted display is an electronic device that is worn on a user's head and, when so worn, secures at least one electronic display within a viewable field of at least one of the user's eyes, regardless of the position or orientation of the user's head.
- a wearable heads-up display is a head-mounted display that enables the user to see displayed content but also does not prevent the user from being able to see their external environment.
- the “display” component of a wearable heads-up display is either transparent or at a periphery of the user's field of view so that it does not completely block the user from being able to see their external environment. Examples of wearable heads-up displays include: the Google Glass®, the Optinvent Ora®, the Epson Moverio®, and the Sony Glasstron®, just to name a few.
- Beam combiners employ reflective mirrors and dichroic filters to combine multiple lights beams into an aggregate beam.
- These dichroic filters generally comprise dichroic coatings on an optically transparent material, usually glass, and have a refractive index that is different than the refractive index of the air the light passes through before impinging on the filter. Light passing through a filter is bent and the emergent ray exits the mirror on a path that is displaced from the path of the incident ray. This phenomenon is shown in FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary beam combiner 100 .
- Beam combiner 100 comprises a reflective mirror 111 , a first dichroic filter 112 , a second dichroic filter 113 , and a third dichroic filter 114 .
- first dichroic filter 112 Light 121 from a first source is incident on reflective mirror 111 and is reflected towards first dichroic filter 112 (shown as arrow 122 ). Light is shown as a single arrow for simplicity, in actuality the spot size of the beam would cover a larger portion of the surface of the mirror or filter. Because the refractive index of the air and the refractive index of the first dichroic filter 112 are different, light 122 is refracted (dashed line) as it passes through first dichroic filter 112 and, therefore, exits first dichroic filter 112 on a “lower” path then the incident path. FIG.
- first dichroic filter 112 is incident on first dichroic filter 112 and is reflected towards second dichroic filter 113 .
- Light 124 comprises light from the first source and light from the second source. At second dichroic filter 113 light 124 is refracted (dashed line) and exits second dichroic filter 113 on a “lower” path then the incident path.
- Light 125 from a third source is incident on second dichroic filter 113 and is reflected towards third dichroic filter 114 .
- Light 126 comprises light from the first source, light from the second source, and light from the third source.
- At third dichroic filter 114 light 126 is refracted (dashed line) and exits third dichroic filter 114 on a “lower” path then the incident path.
- Light 127 from a fourth source is incident on second dichroic filter 111 and is reflected and combined with light from the first source, light from the second source, and light from the third source into aggregate beam 128 to be projected from the laser projector to a surface.
