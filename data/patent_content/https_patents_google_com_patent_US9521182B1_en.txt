- time stamp data may optionally be analyzed in determining if the author should be identified with the document.
- the time stamp data may be indicative of the time of submission of content and may be utilized to determine if the content was submitted prior to any similar content also submitted for authorship identification. For example, if the content submitted for authorship identification is found to the same as other content present in another document and the time of publication of the other content precedes the time stamp data, then the author may not be identified with the content submitted for authorship identification.
- the content submitted for authorship identification may be identified as copied content if the content submitted for authorship identification is found to be similar to other content present in another document and the time of publication of the other content precedes the time stamp data.
- the one or more authorship identifications associated with a document may be utilized to influence the relevance of the document based on whether the document is associated with an author and/or with a particular author.
- the authorship identification may be indexed with the document and utilized as part of a ranking score for the document in response to a search query that identifies the document. For example, in some implementations if a document is associated with an author it may have a better ranking score than if it were not associated with an author. Also, for example, in some implementations a better ranking score may be supplied to a document if it is associated with a particular author. For example, a document relating to a health issue may have a better ranking if it is associated with an author who is an identified medical professional than if it is associated with no author and/or with an author that is not an identified medical professional.
- supplied verification data may be utilized to determine a change rate of content of a document and/or one or more URLs associated with a document such as URLs with the same hostname. For example, in some implementations a submission of verification data may be utilized to identify that a document and/or one or more URLS associated with the document has been changed. The change rate of a document and/or change rate of one or more URLs associated with the document may be utilized, for example, to determine when and/or how a document and/or hostname associated with the document is crawled. In some implementations supplied content data of submitted verification data may be utilized to determine trending terms and/or phrases. For example, the frequent occurrence of certain terms and/or phrases in supplied verification data from multiple authors over a given term period may indicate the terms and/or phrases are trending terms and/or phrases.

- the particular author associated with a document may not be accessible.
- one or more properties of the particular author associated with a document may be accessible. For example, in some implementations the popularity of an author, expertise of an author, a ranking associated with the author, and/or additional properties of the author may be accessible but not identified with a particular author.
- the authorship information for a document may be supplied in combination with search results for that document. For example, the search results for a document may identify the author and/or include information about the author of that document.
- one or more features of the particular author associated with a document may not be accessible but may be utilized in one or more applications.
- features of a particular author associated with a document may be utilized to determine whether a document is identified as responsive to a query and/or as part of the ranking of that document in response to the query.
- a search request may be submitted that includes a request to restrict and/or weight returned results utilizing information pertinent to authorship of the results.
- returned results may be restricted to only those that are identified with a registered author.
- the authorship information associated with the documents may be utilized to restrict and/or weight the search results of the search request according to the request.
