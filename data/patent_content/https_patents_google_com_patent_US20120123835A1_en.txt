- Teaching kids to do complete a task in a diligent, satisfactory, and timely fashion is often difficult. Kids may not be motivated to complete a task, may be bored by the task, or may find no benefit from having completed the task. While offering monetary rewards to kids for completion of tasks, they may not learn the value of saving up towards a goal if they receive immediate gratification in the form of cash.
- A need exists for a simple task management system for managers where the system may be used to set goals and rewards to motivate the individual to complete a task, reward the individual for completing a task, teach the individual concepts related to diligence and saving, and allow the individual to enjoy manager-approved rewards, privileges, and game play associated with points earned upon task completion.
- Provided herein may be methods and systems for managing tasks assigned to an individual by providing a system of goals and rewards, including a collection, matching, and trading game.
- In an aspect of the invention, a method of rewarding individuals for completing assigned tasks may comprise providing a collecting, matching, and trading game facility, wherein the facility provides collectables and collectable packs for collecting, matching, and trading as a reward for having reached a level of task completion; and allowing the individual access to the collecting, matching, and trading game facility, wherein access is based on at least one of permission, a task completed, a number of tasks completed, and a value associated with task completion.

A second step in the wizard interface may be to ‘Choose a Task’. Managers may select from categories of popular tasks or enter their own tasks. Managers may remove tasks or copy tasks from previously created charts. An algorithm may be used to recommend a task assignment. The recommendation may be based upon an age range, similar tasks completed by other individuals, and the like. A third step in the wizard interface may be to select when each task is to be completed, such as Everyday, Every weekday, Every weekend, One time, due on <optional date>, Pick specific days of the week, and the like. A fourth step in the wizard interface may be to select point amounts for each task. An algorithm may be used to recommend a point value to assign to tasks. The recommendation may be based upon the weighted average of points given to individuals by their managers for tasks completed in the past by individuals who may be of a similar age range, hold a similar position, have similar expertise, and the like. A fifth step in the wizard interface may be to name the chart and, optionally, choose or upload an icon for the chart. Goals and Tasks may show their own image icon. Tasks may be categorized into different categories. For example, a manager may use a drop down menu in aTo Do List 202 to organize tasks into categories, such as a separate behavior chart for demerits and good behavior. Referring toFIG. 2 , the onlinetask management system 102 may comprise selection of an individual to complete a task and assignment of a number of points awarded for the task. For example,Weekly Tasks 204 may be listed, such as Brush your teeth, Clean the Kitchen, Pick up your Toys, and the like, with a points value associated with completion of each task. Acalendar 208 may be displayed where completion of the task for a specified time period may be represented by an icon, a number, a letter, or the like. - The
user interface 134 for managers may comprise theRewards Catalog facility 142. A Rewards Catalog may comprise a set of virtual items, real world items, downloadable items, privileges, money, and the like. In an embodiment, points may be used to exchange for virtual items, privileges, and the like. For example, points may be exchanged for the privilege of a sleepover, a chore waiver, a vacation day, and the like; and items, such as Internet time, television time, real world items, downloadable items, virtual items, a character upgrade in avirtual world game 122, and the like. In an embodiment, theRewards Catalog facility 142 may integrate with a television V-Chip in order to control the television time reward. In an embodiment, points may be used as currency to buy downloadable and real world items such as music, movies, video games, bikes, dolls, toys, and the like. In an embodiment, theRewards Catalog facility 142 may facilitate creating a Rewards Catalog for an individual, including rewards such as allowance, charity, downloadable media, playable game items, short term rewards, long term awards, and the like. In embodiments there may be a change allowance button that may display a screen within the current dialog box with a number of button options, such as the individual does not receive allowance, the individual can earn x dollars per week for y points. There may also be a redeem function associated with allowance, where the redeem function may redeem and approve the allowance at the same time. There may be a charity function that displays various options such as the individual is not donating to a charity, the individual gives x dollars to y charity for z points. Long term rewards may be associated with rewards for which individuals save for an item, such as a bike, an Ipod, a camping trip, and the like. Short term rewards may be associated with rewards for which individuals may receive on a daily or weekly basis, such as going to bed one hour past bedtime, going to a friend's house, going to see a movie, and the like. In embodiments, managers may setup multiple short term rewards for each individual. - A first step in the wizard interface may be to select an individual for whom to create/edit a reward catalog. A second step in the wizard interface may be to choose a reward catalog type such as a dynamic catalog wherein rewards and reward prices may be recommended to individuals automatically, a static catalog wherein managers choose the specific rewards to display in the catalog, and the like. The dynamic catalog may comprise an auto suggest feature that may suggest a reward as the manager begins to type a possible reward into a text box. A third step in the wizard interface may be to choose Rewards. If a dynamic catalog may be selected, then dynamic reward categories may be selected. Managers may preview the types of rewards that may be included in each category. If a static catalog may be selected, managers may select rewards from popular categories or enter their own rewards. Managers may also remove rewards or copy rewards from previously created reward catalogs. An algorithm may be used to recommend a reward. The recommendation may be based upon an age range, rewards chosen in the past for similar individual, and the like. A fourth step in the wizard interface may be to determine the cost of rewards. For example, reward prices in terms of points may be calculated automatically by multiplying the dollar price of the reward by a Points Exchange Rate. In another example, a specific points amount for each reward may be indicated. This option may not be available if a dynamic rewards catalog may be selected. In any event, for purchase of real world and downloadable items, the points required for purchase of the item may be debited from an individual's points balance. The corresponding dollar amount of the item may be charged to a manager account when a real world or downloadable item may be selected from a rewards catalog. In an embodiment, the point values for a dynamic rewards catalog may be determined by an indicated point-to-dollar value multiplier. For example if a manager indicates that $1 equals 10 points, then a $5 allowance may cost 50 points. A fifth step in the wizard interface may be to select or upload an icon for the catalog. The
Rewards Catalog facility 142 may be associated with the ApproveRewards facility 152 to approve rewards that an individual may have purchased. The ApproveRewards facility 152 may maintain a Reward History to view rewards that have been approved, rejected, or are pending approval. Bought or approved rewards may be deleted.

The question mark image may indicate that the stamp is unlocked and that there may be additional material available with that stamp once it may be unlocked. Certain views, such as a back view, and certain information of the stamp may not be available to unlocked stamps. - While stamps have been used as an example of the invention's collectable, the invention is not limited by the foregoing examples and illustrations, but is to be understood in the broadest sense allowable by law. Collectables may include any item that an individual may want to collect, such as cards, pictures, figures, virtual items in association with a virtual play space, or the like, and may want to subsequently trade and accumulate in association with other individuals. In an embodiment, the collectable may be a real world object such as a baseball card, a doll, a stuffed animal, a historical item, coins, comic books, figurines, musical boxes, Olympic pins, political pins, scale models, musical instruments, and the like. In an embodiment, the collectable may entertainment, such as a video, DVD, movie, sporting event, musical event, and the like. In an embodiment, the collectable may be a virtual entity, such as a virtual character, an avatar, virtual furniture, virtual version of a real world object, and the like, and further, may be associated with a virtual play area that is part of the invention.
- In an embodiment, the collecting, matching, and trading game may include a quiz system for individuals to earn points and bonus points to earn rewards. There may be a management interface for parents, graders, and system administrators to create online quizzes, where quizzes may be associated with completion of tasks, historical events in chart collection descriptions, clothing and costume descriptions, random trivia, and the like. Results from quizzes may be automatically graded, where managers assign points to completion of quizzes. Quizzes may be triggered off of events, such as calendar events, holiday events, task completion, level completion, collection completion, and the like. For instance, on St. Patrick's Day, a random trivia question associated with the holiday may be generated, such as where does a leprechaun keep his pot of gold? If the individual answers the question correctly, then they may be rewarded with bonus points. Quizzes may be based on an opinion poll, trivia, age based knowledge, and the like, and may be multiple choice, single choice, open ended, and the like. The quiz may also incorporate social aspects such as working on a quiz with a friend, see how your friend did on the quiz, publishing the quiz to multiple kids in different families, have kids create quizzes for each other using a list of questions that may have been provided by the manager or created by them.
- In embodiments, the collecting, matching, and trading game may provide IM or chat to collaborate on doing chores, study, quizzes, community service, schoolwork, and the like. Integrating IM and chat may facilitate interaction in both the play and work parts of the individual's day. In embodiments, the individual may persistently see the user's scoreboard and an IM/chat panel that may stay with the individual throughout the invention's online environment. For instance, in an example, Jill logs in, sees that Mom has assigned her a new task to pick up her clothes and that Mrs. Donavan has posted an extra credit science project to research whales. In her chat window, Jill sees that in her 4th Grade Science Class buddy list, Susan is logged in. Jill pings Susan, “hey lets work on the science project together.” Jill and Susan point their cats to the Science Lab in the virtual world and bring up the assignment that is a web form of questions. They discuss the questions, fill them in together, and then submit their answers as a team. The test is graded immediately and they both receive 100 Bonus Points. Jill then sees that Jackie who is in her Neighborhood Friends buddy list is online: “Hey, I just earned some new points, let's play dress up!” Jill and Jackie load up Jill's cat and browse the catalog together picking different outfits to dress up Jill's cat. Jackie says: “Hey, I have a pair of heels that would look fab with that dress.” Jackie takes the heels from her own wardrobe and loans them to Jill. “Perfect, thanks Jackie!” In this example, the interaction may have been driven through the kids, but behind the scenes their parents may be the managers, ensuring that conditions, such as buddy lists and teacher contacts, are managed through the invention's facility.

TheTask Management Server 802 may have a Payment Application Programming Interface (API) 804 and aPoints API 808. ThePoints API 808 may be an interface with To DoCharts 828, such as aChore Chart 830, aBehavior Chart 832, aStudy Chart 834, aHealth Chart 838, and the like. For example, aBehavior Chart 832 may be a collaborative management by a parent and a teacher. For example, aHealth Chart 838 may be integrated with a heart rate monitor. The heart rate monitor may automatically update theHealth Chart 838. For example, if a task is to get 30 minutes of exercise everyday, if the heart rate monitor detects an elevated heart rate, it may wirelessly indicate the elevation to theHealth Chart 838. In an alternative embodiment, the individual may be required to synchronize a heart rate monitor with theHealth Chart 838 facility in order to indicate that an exercise task has been completed. ThePoints API 808 may allow individuals to earn points from the indicated facilities. Points earned by an individual in theTo Do Charts 828 may be received by thePoints API 808 associated with theTask Management Server 802.
