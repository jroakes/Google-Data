Computer 103 in family 180 can access the Internet to carry out various activities, for example, such as watching the TV programme sent from TV continuous data supplier 102 streams by communication network 130, Internet service provider 128 and home router 120, doing shopping, watch Online Video (on YouTube), play game on line, participate in online social networks or be engaged in a lot of other activities.Program viewing activity is recorded in database 132 by TV continuous data supplier 102, and follows the tracks of by the IP address 126 of family 180, because it easily obtains, and is unique identifier (at least at particular point in time).The data that it should be recognized by those skilled in the art that identification in account information database 132 can find in individual data storehouse, or are distributed to the database of varying number according to execution mode.
In some embodiments, in order to receive the continuous data of a lot of families that TV continuous data supplier collects and their consensus data, distributed measurement server 150 is connected to TV continuous data supplier 102 or account information database 132 or the two.In some other execution modes, distributed measurement server 150 receives the continuous data from the STB117 of family via communication network 130, ISP128 and home router 120.As described below, distributed measurement server 150 estimates TV audience rating for the inquiry in response to from its client and such viewership information offered to the client of the request of sending, and manages it self metering and consensus data's copy.TV continuous data discussed in more detail below, distributed measurement server 150 is stored one group of standard application in its memory, to determine that scope is for example from being less than the reasonable estimation to the audience ratings of the client-requested the short time frame of a few minutes in a second.In some embodiments, distributed measurement server 150 is to the different weight of the data allocations from different suppliers, to eliminate or to reduce associated deviation, weight is one or more geographic demographics's factors functions of (comprising position, sex, age, income, education etc.).
Figure 1B illustrates collecting television program receiving continuous data and the block diagram of the assembly of the distributed measurement server 150 of the estimation of TV audience rating is provided to the client 170 of the request of sending for the multiple sources from such as STB117 and TV continuous data supplier 102 according to some execution modes.In order to process a large amount of television program receiving data, distributed measurement server 150 can comprise hundreds of (for example 512) computer, and each computer is in charge of the subset (also referred to as " burst ") of the television program receiving data definite according to predetermined burst function.As shown in Figure 1B, according to the corresponding function of a hundreds of computer, they are divided into three ranks, and according to the tree-like hierarchy as shown in Figure 1B by the computer link of three ranks together.
The root node of hierarchy is called as " root burst " 151.According to the total quantity of distributed measurement server Computer, hierarchy can comprise the intermediate node of zero or multiple layers.In the example shown in Fig. 1, distributed measurement server 150 comprises one deck intermediate node, and intermediate node is called as " mixture burst " (153-1,153-M).The leaf burst of each mixture management by district predetermined quantity (for example 16) (for example 155 or 157).In the time that distributed measurement server 150 for example, imports new continuous data from data source (STB117 and TV continuous data supplier 102), root burst 151 is responsible for selecting one or more leaf bursts according to predetermined burst function, to distribute new continuous data in distributed measurement server 150.The more detailed description of the data importing processing in distributed measurement server 150 is provided below in conjunction with Fig. 4 A.In the time that distributed measurement server 150 receives the inquiry from client 170, root burst 151 is responsible for according to selecting one or more leaf bursts for the treatment of the predetermined burst function of inquiry.Query Result is submitted to respective mixtures burst 153 by leaf burst.Mixture burst 153 Aggregation Query results, and the Query Result of gathering is submitted to root burst 151, to return to the client 170 of the request of sending.The more detailed description of the query processing in distributed measurement server 150 is provided below in conjunction with Fig. 4 B and Fig. 4 C.In some embodiments, root/mixture/leaf burst is corresponding to the software module of three types, makes the identical calculations hands-operation that the dissimilar burst shown in Figure 1B can be in distributed measurement server 150.For example, the computer of being in charge of the burst (for example leaf burst 155-1) of continuous data also can serve as the mixture burst 153-1 for receive Query Result from other leaf bursts (155-2,155-N), can be even root burst 151.
In some embodiments, burst function is the hash table function from television program receiving data record and one or more leaf burst definition mapping relations, make for given data record, root burst 151 can determine which leaf burst is stored this data record (when in response to inquiry) or which leaf burst will be stored this data record (in the time receiving new continuous data).As example, by exemplary burst function definition be:
Shard_Number=hash_K（TV_ID，STB_ID，Broadcaster_ID）
Wherein " hash_K " refers to the scope [1 of utilizing, K] in sequence number the continuous data (or inquiry) of input is mapped to the predetermined hash table function of corresponding leaf burst, and K be unique leaf burst in distributed measurement server 150 total quantity (, not to the redundant copy counting for each unique leaf burst), it serves as the mould of hash table function.Unique TV in parameter " TV_ID " identification family, and parameter " STB_ID " is identified unique STB that TV is connected to.Parameter " Broadcaster_ID " identification provides unique TV content provider of TV programme to STB.In some embodiments, in order to receive the content from different television content suppliers, one family can have the multiple TVs that are connected to multiple STB.Based on these three parameters, definite which the leaf burst of root burst 151 is responsible for being assigned as the continuous data that the specific TV in particular home generates.For illustrative purposes, some example hypothesis one families of describing below in conjunction with Fig. 4 A to Fig. 4 C have a STB, make household_ID be equivalent to STB_ID.
In some embodiments, carry out configuring distributed measurement server 150 by burst function, make to be dispersed on multiple leaf bursts from the continuous data of a data source, multiple leaf bursts can be associated with identical or different mixture burst.For example, do not allow exceed 5% the continuous data of leaf burst storage from identical data supplier.By doing like this, distributed measurement server 150 can provide estimation audience ratings in response to inquiry, even if it is interim or forever unavailable because of system maintenance or other reasons to be identified as having one or more leaf bursts of the continuous data being associated with inquiry.In some embodiments, distributed measurement server 150 is configured to the copy of the predetermined quantity of identical continuous data to remain on the different computers that are associated from different leaf nodes.Root burst 151 is configured to monitor the use of continuous data copy at different leaf bursts, make in the time receiving the inquiry of continuous data, root burst 151 not only can find which leaf burst has the continuous data of request, and can select the leaf burst that those operating loads are little to process inquiry.On the other hand, the continuous data being associated with same home is stored on identical computer storage, and by identical leaf management by district.In other words, in the time that distributed measurement discovering server the first leaf burst has the continuous data being associated with the family identifying by inquiry, it does not need to find the second leaf burst, because any other leaf burst all has the continuous data identical with the first leaf burst (being copy), or there is no continuous data at all.
To be dispersed on multiple leaf bursts from the continuous data of same data source and keep the configuration of multiple copies of identical leaf burst not only to improve the load balance of distributed measurement server, and make it more fault-tolerant.For given inquiry, may there be multiple leaf bursts to there is continuous data associated with the query.Work at present load based on these leaf bursts, root burst 151 can be identified the subset of the multiple leaf bursts for responding inquiry.If in the leaf burst of identifying is unavailable, root burst 151 can select other leaf bursts of the copy of the continuous data with request to replace original leaf burst.If client 170 receiving portion Query Results, this is particularly useful (for example so, client can be specified in inquiry: if if its accuracy exceedes predetermined threshold or from processing the continuous data that obtains the scheduled volume that is less than whole continuous data set, Query Result is acceptable).
In some embodiments, distributed measurement server 150 provides predetermined API (API), mutual for client 170 and server 150.This API can support existing query language (for example SQL), or tissue based on continuous data on leaf burst defines new more flexibly query language.For example, API and client application 171 can realize with Java.In the time receiving the inquiry that client application 171 submits to, root burst 151 checks these inquiries, and to confirm that it is correct and there is no syntax error, then interprets queries, to determine which leaf burst may have and the continuous data of match query.For example, if inquiry is that the specific program of specific broadcasting organization broadcast is determined to TV audience rating, first root burst 151 identifies one or more leaf bursts that the continuous data providing by this specific broadcasting organization is provided, if the factor of the relevant metering data volume of storing in the present load balance then based on such as leaf burst, leaf burst and the audience ratings accuracy while specifying by client, submits to one or more in identified leaf burst by inquiry.
At the leaf burst of each selection, query engine is responsible for inquiry to be applied to the continuous data of storing in leaf burst.This processing is that the each continuous data record in the memory of the condition of inquiry and computer is compared, and determines whether this data record meets the condition of inquiry.In some embodiments, query engine keeps the counting of the data record that meets inquiry, makes whenever to find that new continuous data record meets inquiry and just will count and increase by one, until checked last data record.
Because continuous data is distributed on multiple leaf bursts, each leaf burst has its query engine, so different leaf bursts produces multiple countings of the data record that meets inquiry independently, then multiple countings of data record are submitted to the respective mixtures burst being associated with these leaf bursts.In some embodiments, it is a counting that mixture burst is assembled multiple countings, and the aggregate totals number of the data record that meets inquiry is submitted to root burst 151, and it returns to the client 170 of the request of sending as at least a portion response to inquiry.
As mentioned above, distributed measurement server 150 can comprise multiple computers, and each computer can be supported polytype burst.Fig. 2 is the block diagram that the assembly of the computer 200 of the root/mixture as the distributed measurement server/leaf burst member operation according to some execution modes is shown.Thereby comprising for the module of execute store 212 storages, program and/or instruction, computer 200 carries out one or more processing units (CPU) 202 of processing operation; One or more networks or other communication interfaces 210; Memory 212; And for by one or more communication buss 214 of these assembly interconnects.In some embodiments, computer 200 comprises user interface 204, and user interface 204 comprises display unit 208 and for example keyboard of one or more input unit 206(or mouse).In some embodiments, memory 212 comprises high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM, or other arbitrary access solid state memory devices.In some embodiments, memory 212 comprises nonvolatile memory, such as one or more disk storage devices, optical disk storage apparatus, flash memory device, or other non-volatile solid state memory.In some embodiments, memory 212 comprises the storage device of one or more positions away from CPU202.Non-volatile memory device in memory 212 or as an alternative memory 212 comprises non-volatile computer readable storage medium storing program for executing.In some embodiments, the following element of computer-readable recording medium storage of memory 212 or memory 212 or the subset of these elements, and can comprise add ons:
Television program receiving continuous data 240(is for example by the data of set top box of family organization), wherein for the data of set top box 242 of each family comprise the TV continuous data record 244 of multiple compressions and family population statistics record 246 both.
In some embodiments, root burst module 220 can further comprise following element:
Final Query Result processing module 222, is prepared as the final Query Result of the client that will return to the request of sending for Query Result leaf burst and mixture burst being returned according to inquiry; And
In some embodiments, mixture burst module 226 can further comprise following element:
Partial query result treatment module 228, for by for example assembling to prepare the Query Result that leaf burst returns, and submits to root burst by the Query Result of processing; And
In some embodiments, data processing module 232 can further comprise following element:
Data importing device module 234, for importing and the continuous data entering and the consensus data of allocate memory 212;
Data compression (decompression) device module 234, be used for is predetermined format by the continuous data entering from its basis format conversion in the case of necessary, and the continuous data entering by recording compressed records to be stored in memory 212, or in the time of response inquiry, the continuous data record of compression is decompressed; And
In order to provide service to client 170, distributed measurement server 150 need to have the TV continuous data of a lot of families.As above in conjunction with described in Figure 1A, for distributed measurement server 150, there are a lot of modes to access TV continuous data.For example, TV continuous data supplier 102 can receive the continuous data form of Set Top Box daily record (for example with) from respective subscriber family.Because distributed measurement server 150 is couple to TV continuous data supplier 102, so TV continuous data supplier 102 can be transmitted to Set Top Box daily record distributed measurement server.In some embodiments, continuous data is stored in (for example viewing-data 142) in account information database 132 by TV continuous data supplier 102, and provide the access to database 132 to distributed measurement server 150.In this case, distributed measurement server 150 can directly receive new continuous data from account information database 132.In some embodiments, distributed measurement server 150 can also directly receive viewing-data from individual family 180.In this case, the Set Top Box daily record that the STB117 in family 180 generates Set Top Box by home router 120, ISP128 and communication network 130 offers distributed measurement server 150.As described below, distributed measurement server 150 can find the position of the new continuous data record entering for trustship, and no matter data record is from the STB117 in TV continuous data supplier 102 or family.
In some embodiments, different TV continuous data suppliers 102 can have the different scheduling that continuous data is provided.Certain supplier can provide new continuous data to distributed measurement server 150 in scope after the predetermined time interval of a day to a week.This relatively long delay may be associated with a large amount of families (for example scope is from several ten thousand to millions of) conventionally with TV continuous data supplier 102, and wait for that possibly the time more of a specified duration is from the daily record of all subscriber's gathering machine top boxs, then for multiple object is relevant to the fact of daily record application predetermined process process.On the other hand, (for example per hour or per minute) new continuous data that it has been accumulated to 150 reports of distributed measurement server more continually of the STB117 in family 180.From the angle of distributed measurement server 150, from the continuous data of homology can be for different objects.For example, can help the TV audience rating that distributed measurement server 150 produces more accurately, deviation is less to estimate from a large amount of continuous datas of TV continuous data supplier 102.But directly can be used for carrying out almost real-time audience ratings from the continuous data of individual family Set Top Box estimates.
Fig. 3 A illustrates that according to the television program receiving continuous data of some execution modes the root burst by distributed measurement server 150 how is transplanted to the block diagram of one or more leaf bursts that root burst selects from data source.In order to illustrate, the data source in this example is TV continuous data supplier 102.As mentioned above, TV continuous data supplier 102 may accumulate a certain amount of TV continuous data, and is ready to transfer data to distributed measurement server 150.According to predetermined scheduling, the new continuous data of its accumulation is sent to distributed measurement server 150 by TV continuous data supplier 102.In some embodiments, continuous data is present in one or more journal files, each journal file comprises that data set provider ID102-1(is associated with TV continuous data supplier 102 uniquely, to be different from other data sources), when report time 102-3(indication journal file edited) and the each record of multiple Set Top Box log recording 102-5(be associated with the Set Top Box of particular home).
Fig. 3 B illustrates that data source (for example TV continuous data supplier 102) according to some execution modes makes the block diagram of the example data structure (for example Set Top Box log recording 102-5) for organizing television program receiving continuous data.Set Top Box log recording 102-5 comprises that STB ID312(identifies in the Set Top Box being associated with TV continuous data supplier 102 or family uniquely), when report time 314(indication log recording 102-5 edited by STB117 and report to TV continuous data supplier 102), duration of daily record time started 316 and daily record end time 318(indication record period) and multiple event 320, each event comprises event id 322, event time started 324, event end time 326, channel information 328, content type 330 etc.The multiple events 320 that are associated with STB117 record the family activity of watching TV programme by STB117, and such as when opening/closing of TV, what program family has watched, and how long each program seen, program of what type etc. has been watched by family.For example, in the time that family is switched to another channel from a channel, STB117 will produce new events record for new channel.Note, individual Set Top Box log recording 102-5 can provide the information of watching custom about individual family.By assembling Set Top Box log recording 102-5 and viewing-data being associated with corresponding geographic demographics's data, can obtain the statistical information such as the audience ratings of the TV programme in niche audience group in specific geographical area, this is in a lot of critical services of providing of distributed measurement server 150.
Distributed measurement server 150 comprises for the one or more bursts 151 from different data source request/reception continuous datas and for example, for multiple leaf bursts (participating in Figure 1B) of distribution and computation data.As shown in Fig. 3 A, when the continuous data that enters in reception, root burst 151 can be applied to continuous data predetermined burst function, and selects one or more leaf bursts to process continuous data.In some embodiments, predetermined burst function is implemented as hash table.For given data set provider ID, the continuous data that has predetermined leaf burst set (for example 155-1 to 155-N) trustship to be associated with this data set provider ID.In order to improve server performance, distributed measurement server 150 will be dispersed on multiple leaf bursts from the continuous data of same data source.For example, server 150 can arrange max-thresholds, makes a leaf burst should have for example, the data that are no more than predetermined percentage or absolute magnitude from particular source (TV continuous data supplier).In some embodiments, server 150 can be also that leaf burst arranges minimum threshold about the data volume from particular source.In some embodiments, root burst 151 for example, transmits the copy of the continuous data entering that it receives from TV continuous data supplier 102 to the leaf burst (155-1 to 155-N) of each identification, makes the leaf burst can parallel data processing.Each leaf burst screens the Set Top Box log recording in continuous data one by one, and selects to be stored in the subset of for example, Set Top Box log recording in the data structure of storing in the memory of leaf burst (300,302 or 304).The more detailed description of the data importing processing at distributed measurement server 150 places is described below in conjunction with Fig. 4 A.
Fig. 3 C illustrates the block diagram that makes to look for store electricity the data structure (for example set-top box recording 340 in memory) of rating continuous data according to the distributed measurement server 150 of some execution modes.Distributed measurement server 150 remains its reset condition by the continuous data entering as far as possible, except being the form that server 150 keeps by continuous data from its basis format conversion.For the each event 320 in Set Top Box log recording 102-5, leaf burst determines whether to have set-top box recording 340 in corresponding memory, if think that Set Top Box log recording 102 is to be distributed in leaf burst, produces corresponding set-top box recording.In some embodiments, in memory, set-top box recording 340 comprises that Record ID 342(can comprise identification data supplier ID, the information of STB ID and the event id that is associated with record), channel information 344, the content time started 346, the end of text time 348, TV information index 350(can be used for the attribute of identification for the TV of view content, for example type, size, manufacturer etc.), the consensus data that home id 352(generates the family of record 340 for being identified as it), the local time of reproduction time 354(indication family view content), watching type 356(indication family is by real time or by DVR view content) and the type of the Set Top Box of Set Top Box type 358(indication contribution set-top box recording 340).In some embodiments, the set-top box recording that is associated with leaf burst is stored in the memory of computer, this makes query processing more effective.In some embodiments, leaf burst compresses each record and the record of compression is stored in memory, to save the space of the more records of trustship.In the time of response inquiry, the each record that decompresses of leaf burst, and determine whether the record decompressing meets inquiry.Can use a lot of known data compression/decompression contracting schemes (for example Lempel-Ziv) for this reason.
Fig. 3 D illustrates the block diagram that makes the data structure (for example family population statistic record 360) for storing family population statistics according to the distributed measurement server 150 of some execution modes.As mentioned above, account information database 132 is for the different object storages such as charging and system maintenance are from the consensus data of millions of families.In some embodiments, distributed measurement server 150 at least keeps the consensus data's who is associated with each family subset.For example, the storage of leaf burst is from all continuous datas of particular home and the consensus data of family.As described below, family population statistics can be a part or the corresponding result of inquiry itself.In some embodiments, family population statistic record 360 comprises that home id 362, home address 364, kinsfolk's quantity 366, family income 368, kinsfolk educate 370 and kinsfolk's age and sex information 372.For efficiency, leaf burst also can be stored in family population statistics in its memory.In the time that reception has the inquiry of the relevant prerequisite of family, if family population statistics does not meet prerequisite, leaf burst can be skipped rapidly the continuous data being associated with particular home.For example, if inquiry is limited to family in a geographic area, if home address indication it outside the geographic area of inquiry, the leaf burst associated continuous data of family that do not need to decompress.In some embodiments, not family population statistics in compressing ram, for example, because its size is conventionally significantly less than the size (, one family may have several thousand set-top box recording) of continuous data and there is no too many income from compression family data.
Fig. 3 E illustrates the block diagram that makes to look for store electricity the data structure (for example television broadcasting mechanism information recording 380) of broadcasting organization's information according to the distributed measurement server 150 of some execution modes.In some embodiments, can on different channels, broadcast identical program by different television broadcasting mechanisms.Sometimes, even if also there is different channels in identical television broadcasting mechanism, for broadcasting identical program in different positions.If inquiry is to find out the audience ratings by the live program of multiple broadcasting organizations in same area, distributed measurement server 150 need to not only have broadcast scheduling 384, and have channel data queued 386, for avoiding missing any set-top box recording by each broadcasting organization of the ID382 of its broadcasting organization identification.
Fig. 4 A for example illustrates, according to the how flow chart of the television program receiving continuous data entering that deal with data source (TV metering supplier or Set Top Box) provides of the distributed measurement server 150 of some execution modes.Note, can push continuous data to server 150 by data source, or be retrieved from data source by server 150.In distributed measurement server 150, can there be multiple computers that root burst module is installed, each as root Fragmentation, and manage the predetermined set of mixture burst or leaf burst, for the treatment of the predetermined set of data source.One in root burst 151 receives the report of (411) TV continuous data from respective data sources.In some embodiments, data source is TV continuous data supplier, and report comprises the multiple logouts that are associated with the different home of subscribing TV continuous data supplier.In some embodiments, data source is the Set Top Box in particular home, and report comprises the multiple logouts that are associated with family.Alternatively, the form that root burst 151 defines from its basis format conversion (413) logout for measuring server 150.Then, root burst 151 is applied to predetermined burst function by the continuous data entering and selects (415) one or more leaf bursts to process logout, makes each leaf burst be responsible for the subset of trustship logout.In some embodiments, can specify which leaf burst to process the continuous data from this data source for determining the identity of data source.For the leaf burst of copy with identical continuous data, root burst 151 is also considered their present load balance (for example, some in them may in other inquiries of service) and selects to compare other have compared with one of heavy load ability.In some embodiments, root burst 151 is according to making to have in same computer the mode from the continuous data of the reasonable percentage of different geographic regions to configure its burst function, makes the accuracy that closing not of a computer in distributed measurement server 150 can negative effect Query Result.Finally, the new continuous data of storing in a leaf burst will be copied to other leaf bursts.Finally, root burst 151 notifies the leaf burst of (417) each selection to process multiple logouts, and for example subset of assignment record in its memory, for subsequent query service.
Each leaf burst 155 places that identify at root burst 151, data importing device module reception (421) multiple logouts or at least its subset.In some embodiments, each has the independent access of the continuous data to entering root burst 151 is selected different leaf bursts 155.For each new logout, data importing device module produces new continuous data record, packed data record, and the data record of compression is stored in to (423) in its memory.Different leaf burst parallel processing logouts, makes each end of record in by a storage in leaf burst.In some embodiments, data importing device module is returned to result (425) root burst 151, and result can be identified the subset of the logout of storing in this specific leaf burst.Root burst 151 can upgrade its burst function by such information, for example makes in the time receiving inquiry, and root burst 151 can determine which leaf burst may have and the continuous data of match query.In some embodiments, data importing device module is also propagated (427) to other leaf bursts (if the each copy with data record that is designated as in them) by newly-generated data record.
In some embodiments, different leaf bursts can have and is associated with the not even copy of the continuous data of same family set of different pieces of information source, to improve the load balance of distributed measurement server, and avoid in them one to become the bottleneck of adverse effect server overall performance.For example, suppose to have three leaf bursts and three data sources, can will be stored in from the continuous data of three data sources on three leaf bursts according to following relation table:
A target of the present invention is that distributed measurement server 150 is provided the answer in the inquiry of watching TV programme and their geographic demographics to distribute as how many families/personnel with real-time mode.Distributed measurement server 150 can be realized this target from the inquiry of client 170 by response, even if it has stored billions of television program receiving continuous data records.
Fig. 4 B illustrates according to the distributed measurement server 150 of some execution modes how will to be applied to television program receiving continuous data from the inquiry of client 170 and Query Result to be returned to the flow chart of the client of the request of sending.Initially, the root burst 151 of server 150 receives (431) inquiry from client 170.Client 170 can provide inquiry by carrying out API Calls to root burst 151.For example, for example, determine that for the specific channel of specific broadcasting organization (" Broadcaster_Channel_Num ") during (for example, from July 2,1 day to 2011 July in 2011) during specified time interval the inquiry of audience ratings can be expressed as follows:
′content<time<interval<start_time:"2011-07-01",end_time:"2011-07-02">>,metered_channel<channel_info:"Broadcaster_Channel_Num">>′.
Above-mentioned inquiry can further be revised as follows, and other parameters by for example, being associated with set-top box recording in memory (STB_Type) are divided into groups Query Result:
′content<time<interval<start_time:"2011-07-01",end_time:"2011-07-02">>,metered_channel<channel_info:"Broadcaster_Channel_Num">>,group_by_spec<screen_group_by_expr:"STB_Type">′.
Above-mentioned inquiry can further be revised as follows, makes the available television continuous data of at least scheduled volume by processing storage in distributed measurement server 150 (for example 50%) draw Query Result:
′content<time<interval<start_time:"2011-07-01",end_time:"2011-07-02">>,metered_channel<channel_info:"Broadcaster_Channel_Num">>,group_by_spec<screen_group_by_expr:"STB_Type">,min_data_set:0.5′.
Above-mentioned inquiry can further be revised as follows, makes Query Result be restricted to specific type (for example only DVR) the rating type of watching:
′content<time<interval<start_time:"2011-07-01",end_time:"2011-07-02">>,metered_channel<channel_info:"Broadcaster_Channel_Num">>,viewing_type_filter<dvr_capable_only:true>,group_by_spec<screen_group_by_expr:"STB_Type">,min_data_set:0.5′.
In the time receiving inquiry, root burst 151 is to query execution (433) sanity check, to guarantee that inquiry is correct on grammer.If inquiry is not by sanity check, root burst 151 returns to error message the client of the request of sending, and the mistake of identifying in can interprets queries.For by each inquiry of sanity check, inquiry is applied to predetermined burst function by root burst 151, and select one or more leaf bursts to process inquiry (435).In some embodiments, this step is similar to the selection leaf burst of step 415 and processes the continuous data entering, and root burst not only considers whether leaf burst has the continuous data of the inquiry of being associated with, and considers the load balance at different leaf bursts place.For example, if not relevant to the television broadcasting mechanism of identification in the inquiry continuous data of leaf burst, root burst 151 is not selected this leaf burst.Even but leaf burst has continuous data, root burst 151 also needs to consider the holistic health of leaf burst, for example, whether the work at present load at leaf burst place becomes the most qualified leaf burst of processing this inquiry.Finally, root burst 151 sends (437) inquiry to each leaf burst of selecting.
At specific leaf burst 155, query engine module receives (441) inquiry, then inquiry is applied to the data record of (443) leaf burst place storage, to determine the counting of the data record that meets inquiry.Provide leaf burst 155 how inquiry to be applied to the more detailed description of the continuous data of leaf burst place storage below in conjunction with Fig. 4 C.Finally, definite counting is returned to (445) root burst 151 by leaf burst 155.As above in conjunction with described in Figure 1B, distributed measurement server 151 is realized in tree-like hierarchy.The different identical inquiries of leaf burst 155 parallel processings, and return to the corresponding definite counting that meets the continuous data record of inquiring about.Because different leaf bursts is processed the different sets of continuous data record, thus do not have data record to be counted twice, and obtain final Query Result by assembling from the partial query result of different leaf nodes.Depend on whether hierarchy comprises any mixture burst, can carry out and assemble separately by root burst 151, or then carry out gathering by root burst 151 by one or more mixture bursts 153.
As shown in Figure 4 B, suppose not have intermediate blend burst to relate to and assemble processing, the part that root burst 151 receives (451) data record from corresponding leaf burst is counted, and is the tale that (453) meet the data record of data record by the gathering of part counting.In some embodiments, for distributed measurement server 150, do not need to check that each possible continuous data records to provide Query Result accurately.If client 170(is advertizer such as) be enough to make his or she satisfied Query Result interested for being accurate to statistically, this is correct especially so.In some embodiments, for distributed measurement server 150, be difficult to provide point-device Query Result, because may there be too many data to process, make client 170 must wait for a long time (for example several hours) and obtain any Query Result.In order to meet the needs of dissimilar client, the final Query Result processing module 222 of distributed measurement server 150 is implemented statistical forecast function, and the Query Result that leaf burst 155 is returned is predicted as the Query Result of whole continuous data set statistical estimates of (455) managing from server 150.Finally, root burst 151 returns to the Query Result of estimation to (457) to the client 170 of sending request.
In some embodiments, root burst 151 use measure burst function, burst health and the load information of servers 150 come leaf burst in identified server 150 bunch in the subset of data sample, to assess inquiry.To bunch in total sample-size counting after, root burst 151 propagates into every other leaf burst 155 together with the original query of the hierarchy definition shown in Figure 1B by total sample-size of each bunch.Particularly, each leaf burst is determined the respective cluster weight that is defined as " kc/Kc ", and wherein kc and Kc are respectively the overall sizes of target demographic in total sample chi (as determined above) and bunch c.For each bunch, root burst 151 is determined weighted average, weighted average is zoomed to whole target demographic, and total population is added together scale value.In some embodiments, for each Set Top Box, leaf burst calculates the weight that is defined as " kc/Kc ", and wherein kc and Kc are sample-size and the overall sizes of the target demographic in leaf burst.Then, the sample-size of root burst 151 based on each leaf burst is weighted on average among all leaf bursts.For other execution modes of statistical forecast, please refer to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.61/501,105 and U.S. Patent application No.12/055,906, each patent merges its full content by reference.
Fig. 4 C illustrates flow chart how to identify the television program receiving continuous data that meets inquiry according to the leaf burst 155 of the distributed measurement server 150 of some execution modes.Leaf burst 155 receives (461) inquiry from root burst 151.In some embodiments, inquiry comprises one or more standards (for example family's filter).Then, one group of candidate family that leaf burst 155 is associated with leaf burst based on its consensus data identification (463), and in selection (465) family one is for further processing.In some embodiments, in the time that ad hoc inquiry arrives leaf burst 155 and operates the certain computer at place, for the treatment of entire population's statistics of this inquiry all in the memory of computer.155 of leaf bursts need to be applied to inquiry the television program receiving data of storing on the memory of computer, and this makes query processing rapid.For the family of selecting, itself and family's filter are compared (467) by leaf burst 155.For example, if family's filter is restricted to inquiry the family of having in predetermined postcode set, the family that does not find its postcode in set can be regarded as defective (469, no), and leaf burst 155 moves to continue to process next family.If but candidate family passes through family's filter (469, be), leaf burst 155 starts to process data record (471) in the memory being associated with this family.In some embodiments, leaf burst 155 is identified data of set top box record in the memory being associated with family, that shown in Fig. 3 C.Leaf burst 155 is data record (if compression) decompression (473), and will inquire about (standard, being associated with inquiry) and be applied to the data record (475) of decompression.Conventionally, there are two possible results from this step: (i) meet the data record of all query criteria or (ii) do not meet at least one the data record query criteria.In the first result, leaf burst 155 is for example accumulated (477) Query Result by the counting of satisfied data record is increased to one.In the second result, leaf burst 155 is skipped simply and is recorded and move to continue processing next data record, until process last data record (479, be).Because record of the method single treatment, so its only needs little memory, therefore leaf burst 155 can be saved more memory and come the data record of store compressed.But because all data record are all stored in memory, so the method is for example, for the client that Query Result is returned to the request of sending by (several seconds within) in the short time period very effective.Process the final data being associated with last family record after (481, be), leaf burst 155 for example, returns to Query Result (meeting the counting of data record of inquiry) to (485) to the higher level's burst (can be root burst or mixture burst) in hierarchy.
