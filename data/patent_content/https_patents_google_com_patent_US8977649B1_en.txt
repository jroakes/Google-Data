Definitions
- This specification generally relates to generating suggestions of user groups in social networks.
- Electronic social networks are network-based services that provide users with an ability to associate and communicate with each other. Users are able to identify other users with whom they have a social relationship (e.g., establishing other users as contacts within a social networking service). Once a social relationship has been expressed, the users typically are able to see communications, status updates, and other notifications generated by the social networking activities of their contacts.
- Social networks also provide services that enable users to identify and associate with groups of other users who share a common interest. Some groups are manually created by a user, and other users are then able to choose to associate themselves with the group. In some cases, membership is open where users are granted membership in the group upon request. In other cases, membership is moderated where one or more users manually decide to accept or deny other users' requests for membership.
- a grouping of contacts can be dynamically generated by a social network or other system.
- the suggested social circle can be automatically generated and populated with each of the one or more contacts, and can be presented to one or more users.
- the suggested social circle can be used to define a distribution of digital content through a social networking service.
- the method can include the actions of generating a list of contacts who, based on first predetermined criteria, are to be considered for potential inclusion in a social circle to be suggested to a particular user and generating an edge and vertex-weighted graph representation that indicates a strength of the particular user's affinity to each of the contacts.
- Each vertex in the graph corresponds to a particular one of the contacts, and the weight of each edge connecting a pair of vertices is based at least in part on an extent of interactions between the particular user and the contacts corresponding to the pair of vertices, an extent of similarities in profiles of the contacts corresponding to the pair of vertices, an extent to which the contacts corresponding to the pair of vertices are members of one another's social circles, and the number of other contacts who are members of at least one social circle for each of the contacts corresponding to the pair of vertices.
- the method includes identifying a set of vertices in the graph that has a high overall score based on predetermined factors, determining that the contacts corresponding to the identified set of vertices should be presented as a suggested social circle to the particular user, and transmitting, to a client device associated with the particular user, social circle data corresponding to the suggested social circle to display a representation of the suggested social circle on the client device.
- the predetermined factors to determine the overall score for a particular set of vertices can include an initial score for the set that represents a strength of the particular user's affinity to the contacts that correspond to the vertices in the set as a whole based on interactions between the particular user and the contacts that correspond to the vertices in the set; the set's conductance; a sum of the weights of each of the vertices in the set; and a preference for a set of a particular size.
- the overall score of the set is based, at least in part, on a weighted sum of the set's initial score, the set's conductance, and the sum of the weights of the vertices in the set.
- implementations of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- social circles to define distribution of digital content can be automatically created for users of a social networking service.
- social connections can be identified such that users can become aware and take advantage of indirect social connections in the context of a social networking service that are more reflective of varying levels of real-world social interactions.
- users of a social networking service are able to share specific pieces of content with appropriate ad-hoc social circles that are presented. Implementations of the subject matter described in this specification may be used to realize other advantages not specifically discussed herein.
- FIG. 1 depicts an example system that can execute implementations of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example social network including social circles.
- FIG. 3 depicts an example graphical user interface for creating and maintaining social circles using an example social networking service.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an example process for generating system-suggested social circles in accordance with implementations of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 5 is an example of an edge and vertex-weighted graph for use in generating a system-suggested social circle in accordance with implementations of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart establishing a weight of vertices in the graph in accordance with implementations of the present disclosure.
- FIGS. 7A and 7B depict example stream pages for a user of a social networking service.
- Implementations of the present disclosure are generally directed to dynamic generation of a grouping of contacts, discussed herein as a social circle, based on past interactions a user has had with other proposed members of the social circle.
- Information about the past interactions is processed to identify one or more contacts and a suggested social circle is generated automatically by the social network system, e.g., generated without further user intervention, that includes the one or more contacts as members of the suggested social circle.
- the system-suggested social circle can be proposed to the user and used to define a distribution of digital content through a social networking service. For example, the system-suggested social circle provides a list of one or more contacts, to which digital content can be distributed.
- system-suggested social circle persists, such that a user can use the social circle multiple times to distribute digital content.
- system-suggested social circle is temporary, such that the user can use the social circle once to distribute digital content.
- social circles are categories or groupings to which a user can assign their contacts (e.g., members of a social network in which the user belongs, other contacts of the user) and better control the distribution and visibility of digital content (e.g., social networking posts).
- a social circle can be provided as a data set defining a collection of contacts that may have some association with one another.
- a social circle can be described from the perspective of an individual that is the center of a particular collection of socially interconnected people, or from the aggregate perspective of a collection of socially interconnected people.
- a social circle can have narrowly defined boundaries, all of the members of the social circle are at least familiar with one another, and permission may be required for a member to join a social circle.
- a social circle can have broadly defined boundaries where, for example, only some of the members are familiar with one another, but there is a commonality among all members (e.g., ride the same bus, are at the same location, are attending the same event, frequent the same locations, partake in the same activities).
- a social circle provides a distribution list that defines which users receive or are otherwise allowed to access digital content.
- Example digital content can include textual content (e.g., posted text), status updates (e.g., busy, available, offline, check-in status), images, videos, hyperlinks and the like.
- the digital content can include a corresponding access control list (ACL), discussed in further detail below, that defines which users are to receive and/or are able to access the digital content.
- ACL access control list
- the user can organize and categorize contacts into various different groupings that can be used to control the visibility and access those contacts have to the user's digital content (e.g., postings, digital pictures, videos, audio files, hyperlinks (e.g., uniform resource indicators (URIs)), and/or other content associated with the user's social networking profile).
- the user can post an update about or a photo taken at an event to only an “event” circle, and spare other contacts from seeing information that may not be relevant to them.
- one or more social circles can be suggested to a user based on past interactions among the potential members of the social circles so as to identify one or more contacts based on automatically determined affinities between the user and the contacts.
- the suggested social circles can facilitate communication between targeted social groups that can reflect indirect, real-world social connections.
- a social network system can search data to identify one or more other persons who previously have interacted with a particular user through one or more communication systems.
- the suggested social circle(s) can be based on such past user interactions.
- the data that is used to identify one or more other persons includes data that is specifically authorized by a user for such use.
- one or more users e.g., the particular user and/or the one or more other persons
- Electronic social networking services can be used as tools for building and maintaining networks of personal, familial, academic, professional, and other interpersonal relationships.
- Real-life social networks also include dynamically shifting relationships in which tangential social contacts may be united through common behaviors (e.g., exchange of communications).
- the social network system may determine that a number of posts, photos or other information has been shared electronically among a group of users. In response, the system can generate a suggested social circle based, at least in part, on such interactions.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example network architecture 100 that can execute implementations of the present disclosure.
- the network architecture 100 includes a number of client devices 102 - 110 communicably connected to a server device 112 by a network 114 .
- the server device 112 includes a processing device 116 and a data store 118 .
- the processing device 116 executes computer instructions (e.g., social network computer program code) stored in the data store 118 to perform the functions of a social network server.
- a number of users 120 a - 120 e of the client devices 102 - 110 access the server device 112 to participate in a social networking service.
- the client devices 102 - 110 can execute web browser applications that can be used to access the social networking service.
- the client devices 102 - 110 can execute software applications that are specific to the social network (e.g., social networking “apps” running on smartphones).
- the users 120 a - 120 e can participate in the social networking service provided by the server device 112 by posting information, such as text comments (e.g., updates, announcements, replies), digital photos, videos, or other appropriate electronic information.
- information can be posted on a user's behalf by systems and/or services external to the social network or the server device 112 .
- the user 120 a may post a review of a movie to a movie review website, and with proper permissions that website may cross-post the review to the social network on the user's 120 a behalf.
- a software application executing on a mobile device may use global positioning system (GPS) capabilities to determine the user's location and automatically update the social network with his location (e.g., “At Home”, “At Work”, “In Brownsdale, Minn.”).
- GPS global positioning system
- Users 120 a - 120 e interacting with the client devices 102 - 110 can also use the social network provided by the server device 112 to define social circles to organize and categorize the users' 120 a - 120 e relationships to other users of the social network. Examples of the creation and use of social circles are provided in the description of FIG. 2 , and throughout the remainder of the present disclosure.
- the client devices 102 - 110 can be computing devices such as laptop or desktop computers, smartphones, personal digital assistants, portable media players, tablet computers, or other appropriate computing devices that can be used to communicate with an electronic social network.
- the server device 112 can be a single computing device such as a computer server. In some implementations, the server device 112 can represent more than one computing device working together to perform the actions of a server computer (e.g., cloud computing).
- the network 114 can be a public communication network (e.g., the Internet, cellular data network, dialup modems over a telephone network) or a private communications network (e.g., private LAN, leased lines).
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example social network 200 including social circles.
- a user 202 is a member of a social network that supports the creation and use of social circles (e.g., the social network provided by the server device 112 of FIG. 1 ).
- the user 202 has a number of contacts 204 a - 204 i with which the user 202 can have some form of relationship (e.g., friends, coworkers, customers, teammates, clients, relatives, club members, classmates).
- the user 202 categorizes the contacts 204 a - 204 i by assigning them to one or more social circles, such as a social circle 210 , a social circle 220 , and a social circle 230 .
- a social circle 240 which has a number of contacts 242 a - 242 c , is provided as a system-suggested social circle that can be automatically generated without input from the user 202 .
- the social circle 240 can be generated, for example, based at least in part, on information about prior interactions between the user 202 and the users 242 a - 242 c (e.g., electronic posts, uploaded photos, online forums, discussion forums, interactions through social networking websites and contact lists, and/or other interactions authorized by the users for such use).
- the social circle 210 is a personal social circle.
- personal social circles are groupings created by the user 202 and may be known only to the user 202 (e.g., the contacts 204 a , 204 b may receive no indication that they are in the user's 202 personal social circle 210 ).
- personal social circles are groupings created by the user 202 and may be known to the user 202 as well as the contacts (e.g., contacts 204 a , 204 b ) that are members of the social circle (e.g., the contacts 204 a , 204 b receive an indication that they have been added to the personal social circle 210 ).
- personal social circles may be used to organize and categorize the contacts 204 a - 204 i in ways that are relevant to the user 202 .
- the user 202 may use personal social circles to organize contacts in order to discretely target which of his contacts 204 a - 204 h will see certain postings or have access to particular information.
- the user 202 may be planning a surprise party for a small group of friends. As such, the user can organize contacts into “Surprise Party Attendees” and “Surprise Party Honorees” personal social circles.
- the user 202 may better target selected postings to the friends attending and/or helping to plan the surprise party (i.e., Surprise Party Attendees), while targeting selected postings to friends that are to be honored at the surprise party (i.e., Surprise Party Honorees) to maintain the integrity of the surprise.
- Surprise Party Attendees i.e., Surprise Party Attendees
- Surprise Party Honorees selected postings to friends that are to be honored at the surprise party
- the social circle 220 is a shared private social circle, which may also be referred to simply as a shared circle.
- shared private social circles are social circles that the user 202 creates and invites contacts to join voluntarily. Contacts that accept the invitation become members of the shared private social circle.
- Members of a shared private social circle can see information posted to that circle by the user 202 and can post information to be shared with other members of the shared private social circle. For example, the user 202 may tend to post a large number of jokes to the social network. However, while some of the contacts 204 a - 204 i may find the jokes to be entertaining, others may find them to be simply annoying.
- the user 202 may create a “jokes” shared private social circle and invite some or all of the contacts 204 a - 204 i to join. With the “jokes” social circle in place, the user 202 may post witticisms to the “jokes” circle, and only those contacts who have accepted the invitation are able to see the user's 202 comicality. Similarly, members of the shared private social circle are able to post messages to the circle, and those posts are visible to other members of that circle.
- the social circle 230 is a shared public circle.
- shared public circles are social circles that the user 202 creates, and invites contacts to join voluntarily. Further, the existence of a shared public circle is publicly available such that other users of the social networking service (e.g., not necessarily just the user's 202 contacts 204 a - 204 i ) may request to join the public social circle.
- Members of shared public circles may post information to, and see updates posted by, other members of the same public shared circle.
- public shares circles may be “fan” or “group” circles (e.g., circles dedicated to a particular place, event, product, movie, celebrity, sports team, company, concept, philosophy, organization, support network).
- the user 202 may create a shared public circle for his band, and fans of his act may join the circle to discuss upcoming shows, download music of the band's music, or post videos from recent concerts.
- the user 202 may create a shared public circle for alumni of his high school graduating class, which his former classmates may find and join in order to stay in touch with one another and post pictures from their school days.
- the user 202 can invite people to join the circle.
- nonmembers of the circle can request membership in the shared public circle, and membership in a shared public circle may be automatic upon request, or may require the user's 202 approval to become members of the shared public circle.
- the suggested social circle 240 can be generated automatically based, at least in part, on past interactions between users of the social networking service. For example, one type of interaction occurs if the user 202 uploads and shares photos with all or some of the other users 204 a - 204 i .
- social networking posts by the user 202 can be analyzed to determine which of the other users 204 a - 204 i looked at the information in the posts.
- other social interactions can be analyzed to determine the extent and nature of interactions among the user 202 and the users 204 a - 204 i.
- Users of a social networking service can voluntarily submit information to the social networking service for sharing such information with other users of the social networking service.
- Such information can include, for example, a textual post, a status update, a digital image, a check-in status, a digital video.
- Other information can be submitted to the social networking service.
- a timestamp can be associated with each piece of information submitted by a user (e.g., a timestamp can be generated and associated with a user status update corresponding to the time at which the user submitted the status update).
- This information as well as information regarding any interactions among the users can be stored to a central repository such as the data store 118 of FIG. 1 .
- the social networking service can process the user information stored in the central repository to generate one or more suggested social circles, which can be presented to users of the social networking service.
- the social networking system can generate one or more suggested social circles based, at least in part, on an analysis of past user interactions.
- the suggested social circle can be pre-populated with particular contacts identified by the social networking system. Users associated with the contacts can be invited to use the social circle. The user can accept the suggested social circle and use it to distribute digital content.
- a user can opt into or opt out of being presented with suggested social circles for use in distributing digital content, and/or being a member of a suggested social circle, including having associated data processed for use in determining suggested circles.
- a user can explicitly authorize types of data that can be used for generating suggested social circles.
- Example types of data can include data associated with electronic interactions over a network (e.g., electronic posts, uploaded photos, online forums, discussion forums, interactions through social networking websites and contact lists, and/or other interactions).
- FIG. 3 depicts an example graphical user interface (GUI) 300 for creating, editing and/or maintaining social circles.
- GUI 300 can provide a social graph editor user interface (UI).
- UI social graph editor user interface
- the UI can be an interface presented by a purpose made social networking application, while in some implementations the UI can be one or more web pages of a social networking website displayed in a general purpose web browser.
- the UI includes a number of selectable links presented in a menu bar 305 .
- the “Social Network” link has been selected by a user. This selection causes a web-based social networking application to be executed and a social network menu 310 to be displayed.
- the social network menu 310 includes a profile indicator 312 in which information such as a user name 314 and a user image 316 associated with the currently logged in user (Rob McDavies) are displayed.
- the social network menu 310 also displays, among other items, a circles submenu 318 .
- the circles submenu 318 when selected (e.g., as represented by the highlighting of the submenu's title), causes a social circle display 320 to be displayed.
- the social circle display 320 includes a number of social circle representations 322 a - 322 e that are visual representations of various social circles that the user has created or is able to interact with. Each of the social circle representations 322 a - 322 e displays information about the social circle it represents.
- the social circle representation 322 c displays a name 324 a (System-Suggested Circle A), a count 324 b of the number of contacts associated with the social circle, and an indication of what type of social circle that the social circle representation is representative of (e.g., system-suggested, personal, private shared, public shared).
- a name 324 a System-Suggested Circle A
- a count 324 b of the number of contacts associated with the social circle
- an indication of what type of social circle that the social circle representation is representative of e.g., system-suggested, personal, private shared, public shared.
- the social circle display 320 also includes a contact display 326 .
- the contact display 326 provides a graphical interface for viewing, selecting, and organizing items in the user's contact lists.
- a collection of contact icons 328 a - 328 i represents the contacts or other entities (e.g., organizations, places, or other items) socially networked with the particular user.
- the icons can be digital images of the contacts that are represented (e.g., the icons 328 a , 328 d ), arbitrary images (e.g., the icons 328 b , 328 g ), or placeholders (e.g., when the contact has no image associated with their account, such as the icon 328 c ).
- a scroll bar 329 is provided for the user to access additional contact icons that may not fit into the initial view.
- a collection of filter buttons 332 a - 332 d is provided to select subsets of the user's contacts.
- the “all people” filter button 332 a when selected, causes the contact display 326 to display the user's contacts with substantially no filtering.
- the “selected” filter button 332 b when selected, causes the contact display to display only the contacts that have been selected by the user. For example, the user may select multiple contacts while in an “all people” view, and then display only selected contacts by pressing the “selected” filter button 332 b .
- the “in circles” filter button 332 c when selected, causes the contact display 326 to display only the contacts who share at least one social circle with the user.
- the “no circles” filter button 332 d when selected, causes the contact display 326 to display substantially only the contacts that is not in a social circle with the user.
- a search input box 325 is provided so the user can type in all or part of a name, and the resulting matches will appear in the contact display 326 .
- the social circle display 320 also includes a collection of social circle filter buttons 340 a - 340 d .
- the “all circles” button 340 a when selected, causes the social circle display 320 to display representations of substantially all of the social circles that the user is able to interact with.
- the “personal” button 340 b when selected, causes the social circle display 320 to display representations of substantially only the user's personal social circles.
- the “shared” button 340 c when selected, causes the social circle display 320 to display representations of substantially only the user's shared private social circles.
- the “shared-public” button 340 d when selected, causes the social circle display 320 to display representations of only the user's shared public circles.
- the “suggested” button 340 e when selected, causes the social circle display 320 to display only representations of social circles that were suggested to the user by the social network system.
- the social circle representations 322 c and 322 d are graphical representations of social circles suggested to the user by the social network system, such as the social circle 240 of FIG. 2 .
- the social circle representation 322 c represents a first suggested social circle
- the social circle representation 322 d represents a first suggested social circle
- the social circle display 320 can present one or more system-suggested social circles that have been determined to have an estimated greatest relevance to the user. For example, a plurality of possible social circles can be examined as being associated with a particular user. Instead of showing all of the possible social circles that may be of interest to the particular user, the social networking service can display only a subset of the possible social circles examined. In some implementations, the possible social circles can be ranked in order based on the respective relevance scores and the top scoring (e.g., top two, top three) social circles are displayed to the user.
- the top scoring e.g., top two, top three
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an example process 350 for generating a system-suggested social circle within a social networking system.
- the process 350 can be performed, for example, by a server device, such as the server device 112 of FIG. 1 .
- the server device 112 generates and stores data for an edge-weighted and vertex-weighted graph that represents the strength of a particular user's affinity to various contacts (e.g., other people) and the extent of interactions, similarities and/or relationships among the contacts ( 352 ).
- the graph is an abstract representation of a group of contacts where various pairs of the contacts are connected by links.
- the interconnected contacts can be represented by vertices, and the links that connect some pairs of vertices can be called edges.
- the graph can be depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges. An example of such a graph is illustrated in FIG. 5 , which includes six vertices and seven edges. Other graphs may have a different number of vertices and/or edges.
- Data about the graph can be stored, for example, in a data store (e.g., data store 118 ).
- the server device 112 To generate the graph, the server device 112 generates ( 354 ) a list of contacts who, based on some predetermined criteria, are to be considered for possible inclusion in a social circle to be suggested to a particular user such as the user 202 .
- a particular user such as the user 202
- the particular user and various contacts may be referred to by names (e.g., Alice for user 202 ; Bob and Charlie for some of the contacts).
- the server device 112 can use various sources of information to generate the list of contacts.
- the server device 112 generates the list of contacts for the particular user (e.g., Alice) based on the user's own data (e.g., information about which the particular user already is aware or about which the user could become aware based only on the user's own data) as well as other sources of information that also are available to the user, even if the user may not currently be aware of the information (e.g., information that is publicly available from the Internet).
- the user's own data e.g., information about which the particular user already is aware or about which the user could become aware based only on the user's own data
- other sources of information that also are available to the user, even if the user may not currently be aware of the information (e.g., information that is publicly available from the Internet).
- the server device 112 can analyze data about interactions the user (e.g., Alice) previously had during a specified period of time, such as during the past year.
- the server device 112 can take into consideration, for example, various types of prior interactions between the particular user and other users 204 a - 204 i of the social networking system.
- One type of interaction that can be considered is a social networking post sent by the particular user (e.g., Alice) that is viewable by some or all of the other users (e.g., Bob and Charlie).
- Another example of an interaction is a social networking post by one of the other contacts (e.g., Bob) that is viewable by the particular user (e.g., Alice).
- the server device 112 may consider such social networking posts regardless of whether the particular user (e.g., Alice) is specifically identified in a distribution of the post, or the post is publicly viewable. In some implementations, the server device 112 can consider other types of prior interactions, such as Alice uploading and sharing information (e.g., photos) with all or some of the contacts. Social networking posts by Alice can be analyzed, in some implementations, to determine which of the other users (e.g., Bob and Charlie) looked at the information in the posts. Depending on the particular implementation, the server device 112 may consider information about one or more of the foregoing types of interactions to identify contacts who previously have interacted with the particular user during the specified period of time.
- the server device 112 may consider information about one or more of the foregoing types of interactions to identify contacts who previously have interacted with the particular user during the specified period of time.
- additional (or different) types of interactions including other forms of network communications to or from the particular user (i.e., Alice, in the foregoing example) can be considered.
- Data about the interactions can be obtained, in some cases, from information stored in the data store 118 or stored elsewhere. All persons with whom the particular user interacted during the specified period of time can be included on the initial list of contacts.
- the server device 112 includes in the list of contacts any additional people who interacted with one or more of the people who are on the initial list.
- any additional people who interacted with one or more of the people who are on the initial list For example, if Alice had exchanged social networking posts with Bob, and Bob had exchanged a social networking post with Charlie during the relevant time period, then Charlie would be included on the list of contacts even if he and Alice did not interact directly with one another. Likewise, If Charlie is a contact in one of Bob's social circles, then Charlie would be included on the list of contacts even if he and Alice did not interact directly with one another.
- such additional contacts e.g., Charlie in this example
- Alice could have discovered the connection between Bob and Charlie, for example, by surfing the Internet or reviewing other publicly available information.
- Other implementations need not be restricted to using only these types of sources.
- Each contact in the list generated by the server device 112 is associated with a vertex in the graph. As indicated by FIG. 4 , after the server device 112 generates the list of contacts, the server device 112 generates a weight for each vertex in the graph ( 356 ) and also generates a weight for each edge in the graph ( 358 ).
- the server device determines the weight for each vertex in the graph as described below in connection with FIG. 6 .
- the server device 112 identifies different sets of contacts, where each set consists of one or more of the contacts who previously interacted directly with the user ( 372 ).
- the server device 112 identifies all possible sets consisting of one or more of the contacts who previously interacted directly with the user. For convenience, the sets can be identified, respectively, as S — 1, . . . S_t.
- the server device 112 would identify the following sets of contacts for further consideration as possible social circles to suggest to Alice:
- the particular user e.g., Alice
- the server device 112 can identify a greater number of sets of contacts.
- the server device 112 determines an initial score for the set based on the strength of interactions between the user and the entire set ( 374 ).
- This initial score represents the strength of the affinity of the particular user (e.g., Alice) to the set as a whole.
- the strength of the interactions increases as the number of situations in which the user (e.g., Alice) interacted with all members of the set increases.
- the strength of the affinity increases if the particular user (e.g., Alice) took an active role in the interactions (e.g., if Alice sent a social networking post to the entire set, rather than if she simply was one of the recipients of a social networking post from one of the other members of the set).
- the strength of the affinity increases for more recent interactions.
- determining the initial score for the set only interactions which involved all members of the set are considered.
- the initial score of a set S for a particular user e.g., Alice uses a decaying count that can be calculated using the following formula:
- n the number of interactions that involved Alice and all members of the set, and where the individual interactions are denoted a i . . . a n .
- t is the elapsed time (e.g., number of seconds) since the beginning of the specified time period
- t(a i ) is the elapsed time since the interaction a i occurred.
- the value c N is a normalization constant that indicates how fast the decay is (i.e., so as to weight recent interactions more heavily than more distant interactions).
- the value of c N may depend on the particular implementation. As a particular example, the value of c N can be set to 31,536,000, which is the number of seconds in a year.
- the value w(a i ) represents a weight for the particular interaction a i and depends, in this example, on the particular type interaction. For example, if the interaction is a social networking post by Alice and the recipient list is the set S, the weight might be accorded a value of one in some implementations, whereas if the interaction is social networking post by a member of the set S to Alice and to the other members of the set S, then the weight might be accorded a different value, e.g., a lower value. In some implementations, the weight w(a i ) varies between values of zero and one hundred. Other ranges of possible weights w(a i ) may be appropriate for some implementations.
- the weight accorded a particular interaction may depend, at least in part, on the type of interaction and whether the particular user (e.g., Alice) took an active role or a passive role in the interaction. For example, if the particular user (e.g., Alice) plays only a passive role as a recipient of post, the weight accorded the interaction can depend on whether the particular user was listed as a primary recipient (e.g., specifically identified in a distribution for the post), or as a general recipient (e.g., a publicly viewable post). In some implementations, the weight of an interaction may depend on other factors as well.
- the server device 112 also determines, for each member in the set S, a score that represents the average strength of the affinity of the user (e.g. Alice) to the particular member in the set S based on a weighted sum of the scores for all sets that include the particular member ( 376 ).
- a score that represents the average strength of the affinity of the user (e.g. Alice) to the particular member in the set S based on a weighted sum of the scores for all sets that include the particular member ( 376 ).
- the affinity of the user (Alice) for example, toward Bob is based on all interactions the user had with sets of people that contain Bob, including interactions with Bob only.
- the affinity of the user (Alice) toward Charlie is based on all interactions the user had with sets of people which contain Charlie, including interactions with Charlie only.
- the strength of the affinity increases as the number of situations in which the user (e.g., Alice) interacted with a set that contains the particular member (e.g., Bob) increases. Likewise, in some implementations, the strength of the affinity increases if the user (Alice) took an active role in the interactions (e.g., Alice sent a social networking post to the particular member of the set and to other people, rather than simply being one of the recipients of a social networking post). Also, in some implementations, the strength of the affinity increases for more recent interactions. In some implementations, the user's score with respect to a particular member B of the set S (e.g., Alice's score with respect to Bob or Charlie) can be calculated using the following formula:
- Alice ⁇ ⁇ - ⁇ Score ⁇ ( B ) ⁇ S , B ⁇ S ⁇ ⁇ Alice-Score ⁇ ( S ) ⁇ S ⁇
- denotes the size of the set S (i.e., the number of members in the set). The summation is taken over all sets that include the particular member B.
- the server device 112 calculates such a score for each member of the set S for which the original score is calculated.
- the server device 112 then sets the weight of each vertex in the graph ( 378 in FIG. 6 ) to the score of the individual member who is associated with that vertex.
- the server device 112 also generates a weight for each edge of the graph ( 358 in FIG. 4 ).
- the edge is accorded a weight based on a weighted sum of several scores, which can include, for example, an interaction score, a similarity score, a friendship score and a Jackard score. These scores are explained in greater below. If an edge is determined to have a weight of zero, the server device 112 can treat that edge as not being present in the graph. Although information about such an edge and its weight of zero could be stored by the server device 112 , treating the edge as not existing reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored about the graph and can reduce further computations that may need to be performed subsequently.
- the interaction score for the edge would be the weighted sum of the score of the interactions of Alice with all sets containing both Bob and Charlie.
- the interaction score is determined according to the following formula:
- the similarity score is based on the extent of similarity of profiles for the two contacts associated with the pair of vertices that are connected by the particular edge in the graph. In some implementations, the similarity score is based only on information that is determined by the server device 112 to be known by, or at least available to, the particular user (e.g., Alice). In some implementations, the server device 112 determines the similarity of the profiles based on whether or not any of the following statements regarding the two contacts (e.g., Bob and Charlie) represented by the pair of vertices is true:
- the weight of the edge of the graph that connects the vertices which represent Bob and Charlie is increased based on the fact that statements 1 and 2 are true.
- the amount that the value of the edge is increased for each true statement can depend on the particular implementation.
- the friendship score is based on whether either of the two contacts associated with the pair of vertices that are connected by the particular edge in the graph is a member of a social circle belonging to the other contact.
- the friendship score is based only on information that is determined by the server device 112 to be known by, or at least available to, the particular user (e.g., Alice). For example, if Bob is a member of one of Charlie's social circles, then (assuming this information is known or available to Alice) the friendship score can be increased by one. Likewise, if Charlie is a member of one of Bob's social circles, then (assuming this information is known or available to Alice) the friendship score can be increased by one.
- the friendship score can be increased by three. In other implementations, the friendship score may be increased by different amounts.
- the Jackard score depends on the number of people who are members of at least one social circle of both the contacts associated with the pair of vertices that are connected by the particular edge in the graph. For example, in some implementations, if the number of people who are members of both Bob and Charlie's social circle is less than a predetermined number (e.g., 3), then the Jackard score is set to zero. On the other hand, if the number of people who are members of Bob and Charlie's social circle is equal to or greater than the predetermined number, then the Jackard score is set to the ratio of the size of the intersection between Bob and Charlie's social circles and the size of the union of their social circles. Thus, assuming that B s represents the set of people in Bob's social circles and C s represents the set of people in Charlie's social circles, then, if
- the Jackard score is based only on information that is determined by the server device 112 to be known by, or at least available to, the particular user (e.g., Alice).
- an edge of the graph is accorded a weight based on a weighted sum of the interaction score, the similarity score, the friendship score and the Jackard score.
- the weighting of each of these scores can depend on the particular implementation.
- the server device 112 After the server device 112 has calculated and stored the weights for each vertex and for each edge in the graph, it proceeds to use the data represented by the graph to identify a set of contacts (i.e., a set of vertices in the graph) that has a high overall score based on various predetermined factors ( 360 in FIG. 4 ).
- the factors that contribute to the overall score for a set include the set's initial score, the conductance of the set, the importance of the set, and the size of the set. Each of these factors is described in greater detail below.
- the overall score for a particular set can be based on a weighting of the foregoing factors.
- the overall score can be based on a weighted sum of the set's initial score, the conductance of the set, the importance of the set.
- the size of the set can be used as a multiplicative factor that introduces a preference for sets having a certain size (or that fall within a specified range of sizes).
- the set's initial score (e.g., Alice-Score(S)) is described above in connection with action 374 of FIG. 6 and is based on the strength of interactions between the particular user (e.g., Alice) and the entire set (S). As explained above, the set's initial score represents the strength of the affinity of the particular user (e.g., Alice) to the set as a whole.
- the conductance score can measure how well-knit the set is and can control how fast a random walk G converges to a uniform distribution.
- the conductance can be determined, for example, using the following formula:
- the importance of a set can be calculated as the sum of the weights of each of the vertices in the particular set.
- the size of a set also can contribute to the overall score for the set based on a predetermined preference for social circles of a particular size. For example, in some implementations, if the size (k) of the set (i.e., the number of vertices in the set) is greater than a specified amount (p), then the set's score (based on the other factors) is divided by r (k-p) , where ‘r’ and ‘p’ are constants. As an example, the value of r can be 1.7 and the value of p can be 5. Different values for ‘r’ and ‘p’ can be used in other implementations.
- the server device 112 to identify a set of vertices (representing a set of contacts) that has a high overall score, the server device 112 considers sets that consist of a single vertex (representing a particular contact) and determines the respective overall score for each such set. The process can continue with the server device 112 adding another vertex (representing another contact) to one or more of the initial sets and determining the respective overall score for each of the new sets. The server continues this process so long as a new set increases the overall score as compared to the overall score of the previous set on which it was based. In this manner, the server device 112 can identify at least one set of vertices that has a relatively high overall score compared to the overall scores of other possible set of vertices. A set of contacts that corresponds to the set of vertices having the highest identified overall score then can be proposed to the particular user as a system-suggested social circle.
- the system-suggested social circle then can be presented to the user ( 362 of FIG. 4 ).
- computer-executable instructions can be transmitted to a user computing device (e.g., as part of a web page) that, when executed, generate a graphical representation of the system-suggested social circle in a display (e.g., in a user interface of a website of a social networking service).
- the user can use each system-suggested social circle to distribute digital content to and receive digital content from other identified users associated with the suggested social circle.
- the suggested social circle can be presented to the user 200 who is then given the option of whether or not to accept the suggested social circle.
- the process 350 of FIG. 4 can proceed to determine whether one or more additional social circles should be suggested to the user. In such situations, the process would proceed, for example, to identify other sets of vertices that have a relatively high overall score and to propose the contacts corresponding to the vertices in each such set as a system-suggested social circle. The process may proceed either until a predetermined maximum number of social circles are suggested to the user or until all the remaining sets have been considered.
- the operations in the process 350 are described as being performed by a server device such as the server device 112 . In other implementations, however, a different server device or processing device may perform part or all of the process.

- the social networking system may suggest that the user 202 revoke his membership, or his membership may be automatically revoked.
- one or more default social circles can be provided or suggested to a user when the user subscribes to a social networking service. For example, “Friends,” “Family,” and “Coworkers” social circles can automatically be provided in a user's profile upon the user subscribing to the particular social networking service. Other social circles can automatically be provided including, for example, an “Acquaintances” social circle and/or a “Just Following” social circle.
- the automatically created or suggested social circles can include personal social circles.

- the post data set includes a plurality of data.
- the post data set includes content data (e.g., text, uniform resource indicator (URI)), timestamp data (e.g., a timestamp indicating the time that the post was generated), distribution data (e.g., contacts and/or one or more social circles), and identification (ID) data (e.g., an ID assigned to the post data set upon generation of the post).
- the distribution data is processed to provide an access control list (ACL) that specifies which contacts within the social networking system are granted access to the post content.
- ACL access control list
- the distribution hub determines end points the post data set is to be distributed to based on the ACL. More specifically, the set of contacts that care about the post and/or that are allowed access to the post is determined based on the ACL and the ID of the post is written to a per user/view index at the distribution hub. When fetching posts to distribute to a user, the user/view index is accessed and the IDs of the various posts that the user is allowed to view are determined.
- the post data sets are retrieved from a data store (e.g., data store 118 of FIG. 1 ) and are transmitted to a client device associated with the requesting user.
- a user need not explicitly join the system-suggested social circle as a member and can simply use the social circle as a distribution list (e.g., ACL) to distribute digital content.

- the suggested social circle then can be presented to a user for distribution of digital content.
- the user may determine that digital content should also be distributed to other contacts of the user within the social networking service. Consequently, the user can add known contacts to the suggested social circle.
- a user automatically can receive content distributed by other users of the system-suggested social circle. For example, if the user is presented with a social circle (e.g., in a user interface of the social networking service), digital content distributed by other users of the social circle may be distributed and presented to the user without the user explicitly requesting to receive such digital content.
- the user can elect to not receive any digital content distributed by other users of the suggested social circle. For example, the user can provide user input through a user interface of the social networking service, the user input indicating that digital content distributed through the suggested social circle should not be distributed to the user. In short, the user can remove herself from the ACL underlying the suggested social circle.
- the user can elect to not receive any digital content distributed by one or more particular other users of the suggested social circle.
- the user can provide user input through a user interface of the social networking service, the user input indicating that digital content distributed by a particular other user through the suggested social circle should not be distributed to the user.

Description
where n is the number of interactions that involved Alice and all members of the set, and where the individual interactions are denoted ai . . . an. In this example, t is the elapsed time (e.g., number of seconds) since the beginning of the specified time period, and t(ai) is the elapsed time since the interaction ai occurred. The value cN is a normalization constant that indicates how fast the decay is (i.e., so as to weight recent interactions more heavily than more distant interactions). The value of cN may depend on the particular implementation. As a particular example, the value of cN can be set to 31,536,000, which is the number of seconds in a year.
