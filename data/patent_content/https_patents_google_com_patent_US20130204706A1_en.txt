- Content sponsors may be willing to bid higher for impressions of their content if the content sponsors have control over the types of users who are targeted, including users who are targeted based on a distance between their current location and the geographic location associated with the content item.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment for delivering content.
- FIGS. 2A and 2B collectively show an example system for targeting and providing content to users based on location-distance targeting criteria.
- FIG. 3A is a flowchart of an example process for targeting content using location-distance targeting criteria.
- FIGS. 3B and 3C are flowcharts of example processes for serving content using location-distance targeting criteria.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example computer system that can be used to implement the methods, systems and processes described in this disclosure.
- Content sponsors can target content to users based on their current location relative to a location associated with a content item (e.g., an advertisement).
- a content sponsor C can submit offers (e.g., bids for use in an auction or an offer that is part of a reservation, hereinafter collectively referred to as an “offer”) for subsequent impressions of advertisements in a campaign that is targeted to users within one or more specified distances from a target location.
- the offers can depend, for example, on whether users to whom the content is to be presented are currently at a location within the distance(s) specified in the targeting criteria.
- the user's current location can be determined, and corresponding offers for content can be identified (e.g., from offers made by the content sponsor C and other content sponsors). For example, if the user's current location satisfies the distance criteria associated with the offer, then the bid for the content item can be identified. Depending on the terms of the offer, the content item associated with the content sponsor C can be provided in response to the request for content.
- a location can be a geographic location, (e.g., latitude/longitude coordinates), a point (e.g., an address) or a geographic feature that corresponds to a city, a metropolitan area, a county, a state, a region or a country.
- Distances between a user's location and a feature can be determined, for example, based on a point that represents the feature or based on a boundary associated with the feature. For example, distances can be determined relative to an address of a hotel or business (e.g., represented as a point) or relative to the boundary of a city, metropolitan area, county, state, region or country (e.g., represented as a perimeter, polygon or other shape).
- location-distance targeting can be used, consider an advertiser who has a hotel in San Francisco. For example, because of the location of the hotel, the advertiser may want advertisements associated with the hotel to be targeted to users who are a certain distance from the hotel and may be likely to need hotel accommodations when traveling to San Francisco.
- Ads for the hotel can be targeted to users who, for example, submit queries associated with San Francisco and whose current locations are far away (e.g., over 1000 miles). For example, the queries may signal an intent to visit San Francisco, a trip that may require a hotel room. This can provide the content sponsor with an opportunity to target users who may be more likely to engage with the content (e.g., an ad for the San Francisco hotel).
- a user in New York City may be running a map application that displays the San Francisco area, or the user may have a San Francisco business listing displayed (e.g., after submitting a query in a browser). Because the user's location of interest is far away (e.g., more than 1000 miles) from the user's current location, it may be likely that the user plans to travel to San Francisco.
- content sponsors e.g., advertisers who are hotel owners or airline ticket agencies may want to pay more to show their advertisements to remote users.
- users in Northern California may have business listings (e.g., evening shows in the Mission District) displayed in a web browser. While the users may not be interested in flying to San Francisco, they are also unlikely to drive home after the show.
- content sponsors may want to target the users for hotel-related advertisements, e.g., using a targeting distance that may require a hotel stay but no air travel.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for delivering content.
- the example environment 100 includes a content management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers), content publishers 109 , and the content management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 and content publishers 109 .
- the environment 100 can include plural data stores that are used in various stages to target and deliver content based on location-distance targeting.
- a data store of campaigns 126 can store campaigns that are created by content sponsors 108 , e.g., using the sponsor interface 120 .
- the campaigns 126 can include targeting criteria specified by content sponsors 108 to target content to users based at least in part on location-distance targeting.
- location-distance targeting can include targeting of content based at least in part on the distance between the current location of a user and the geographic location associated with a content item.
- the content management system 110 includes a request handler that can receive a request for content from a user, identify one or more eligible content items, and provide a content item responsive to the request. More specifically, the request handler can determine, for campaigns 126 that include location-distance targeting criteria, if the user who provided the request for content has a current location within a specified distance from the location associated with the content item.
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, televisions, set-top boxes, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- User devices 106 can submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 accesses the indexed cache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 is data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- the content management system 110 can generate search results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from the search system 112 .
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented.
- slots on search results pages or other web pages can include content slots for content items that have been provided as part of a reservation process.
- a reservation process a publisher and a content item sponsor enter into an agreement where the publisher agrees to publish a given content item (or campaign) in accordance with a schedule (e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X) or other publication criteria.
- content items that are selected to fill the requests for content slots can be selected based, at least in part, on priorities associated with a reservation process (e.g., based on urgency to fulfill a reservation) and information related to location-distance targeting.
- the content management system 110 receives a request for content.
- the request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the slot e.g., a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot
- keywords associated with a requested resource e.g., source keywords”
- a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116 .
- the content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”).
- eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116 .
- the content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive offers from content sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource or search results page.
- an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid.
- the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item.
- the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors.
- a conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page.
- a content item e.g., an ad
- a conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable/observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or web page, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item.
- a content provider to be any measurable/observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or web page, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item.
- Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- the likelihood that a conversion will occur can be improved, such as by serving content that is more likely to be of interest to the user.
- content items e.g., ads
- location-distance targeting can also be an indication of how likely the user is to react positively to a content item, e.g., leading to a conversion.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect location information or use the information to target content.
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user.
- a user's geographic location may be generalized so that, for example, when location information is obtained (such as a city, ZIP code or state), a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- FIGS. 2A and 2B collectively show an example system 200 for targeting and providing content to users based on location-distance targeting criteria.
- FIG. 2A shows an example campaign sponsor interface 202 for specifying targeting criteria for a campaign 204 that includes advertisements for an Example San Francisco Hotel.
- the targeting criteria for example, can be used to target advertisements to users based on the distance between the users' current locations and the location associated with the Example San Francisco Hotel.
- the sponsor interface 120 can provide the campaign sponsor interface 202 and/or other interfaces for targeting content to users based on location-distance targeting.
- FIG. 2B shows an example user interface 206 in which targeted content is provided based on a current location 208 of a user 210 .
- the user interface 206 is one example of how the system 200 can provide targeted content based at least in part on the user's current location relative to a San Francisco location 212 associated with a content item.
- advertisements from the content sponsor's advertising campaign e.g., campaigns 126
- campaigns 126 can be provided in response to received requests to deliver content to the user interface 206 .
- the campaign sponsor interface 202 can include a targeting criteria area 214 from which the content sponsor 108 can select targeting parameters for a campaign.
- the targeting criteria area 214 can be one of multiple areas within the campaign sponsor interface 202 .
- the targeting criteria area 214 can include one or more controls for receiving an indication from the content sponsor 108 to target users using location-distance targeting.
- the location-distance targeting for example, can be based on users' current locations (e.g., at content-serving time) relative to the location associated with the content item (e.g., the address of the Example San Francisco Hotel).
- the content sponsor 108 can select a location-distance targeting option 216 , e.g., by checking a “Target users using location-distance targeting” checkbox. For example, selection of the location-distance targeting option 216 can result in the presentation and/or availability of an options area 218 .
- the options area 218 can include various controls and displays including, e.g., distances 220 and bids 222 .
- the each bid 222 can represent the amount that the content sponsor 108 is willing to pay (e.g., per 1,000 impressions) for impressions of content of the campaign 204 to users whose current locations are within the distance 220 .
- distances can be represented using a range.
- entry 224 a includes a bid 222 of $X for impressions of content to users whose current locations exceed 300 miles and are up to 500 miles from a geographic location 226 (e.g., the address of the Example San Francisco Hotel).
- Entry 224 b for example, includes a bid 222 of $Y for impressions of content to users whose current locations exceed 100 miles and are up to 300 miles from the geographic location 226 .
- the options area 218 can include a map 228 that can be used, for example, to display the geographic location 226 associated with the content item.
- the map 228 can be a map that includes California that includes the geographic location 226 that is San Francisco.
- the map 228 can include markers 230 a and 230 b (e.g., push-pins labeled “A” and “B”), for example, that indicate the positions on the map 228 that correspond to distances 220 associated with the entries 224 a and 224 b .
- the markers 230 a and 230 b can correspond to line-by-line indicators 232 (e.g., also labeled “A” and “B”) that label each of the entries 224 a and 224 b relative to the map 228 .
- controls associated with the map 228 can allow the content sponsor 108 to draw or select an area to which to target content.
- an interface based on a positional marker (e.g., cursor, etc.) on the screen can be used to define a bounding region (e.g., by expanding one or more circles having radius) relative to geographic location 226 . Pairs of concentric circles can indicate a range of distances associated with a particular bid.
- the map 228 can include controls for drawing a user-defined polygon or selecting a point, a building, an address, a ZIP code, a city, a county or a state from the map 228 , any of which can also be defined using text input or using selection from a list.
- the campaign sponsor interface 202 can include an add distance control 238 that the content sponsor 108 can use, for example, to add another entry similar to the entries 224 a and 224 b .
- an add distance control 238 that the content sponsor 108 can use, for example, to add another entry similar to the entries 224 a and 224 b .
- a popup (not shown in FIG. 2A ) can appear in which the content sponsor can enter a range of distances (e.g., 500 and 800) for yet another separate bid amount.
- Other ways can be used for entering distances 220 and bids 222 including, for example, tables, arrays and so on.
- distances 220 and bids 222 that appear in fields within the options area 218 can be edited directly, e.g., as text-entry fields.
- distance ranges can be expressed as a minimum distance up to infinity (e.g., “800 miles and beyond”). Other units can be used instead of miles.
- a control 240 can be used to create an entry similar to the entries 224 a and 224 b in order to represent, for example, a bid 222 for the remainder of the distances.
- the content sponsor 108 can specify $Z for a bid 222 for the remainder of distances not represented by the entries 224 a and 224 b (e.g., for distances outside of 100-500 miles).
- statistics can be presented for each range of distances. For example, one set of statistics can provide an estimate of the number of users who may be targeted for each of the different distance ranges.
- the options area 218 can include a location definition control 242 , e.g., for use in situations in which the geographic location 226 is not a single point (e.g., the address of the Example San Francisco Hotel).
- a location definition control 242 e.g., for use in situations in which the geographic location 226 is not a single point (e.g., the address of the Example San Francisco Hotel).
- a popup or other controls can appear by which the user can specify a location associated with the campaign 204 .
- Example locations include a city, county, state, ZIP code, or any user-defined polygon.
- the user interface 206 can be, for example, a web page or some other interface (e.g., a web browser) that the user 210 is using on the user device 106 .
- the user interface 206 can include one or more content item slots 250 , e.g., for displaying advertisements.
- the user interface 206 can provide a request for content 254 that is received by the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 can provide one or more content items 256 that are responsive to the request, as described above.
- the content items 256 that are provided can be selected based at least in part on location-distance targeting described with reference to FIG. 2A .
- the user 210 for which the request for content 254 occurs can be physically situated at the current location 208 , e.g. somewhere in Northern California.
- the user's location can be determined using global positioning system (GPS) capabilities of the user's mobile device, or based on an address voluntarily provided by the user, e.g., in a profile for a non-mobile computer.
- GPS global positioning system
- the content management system 110 can access information in the campaigns 126 to identify content items that are responsive to the request.
- Some campaigns 126 for example, can include location-distance targeting, as described above with reference to FIG. 2A .
- Other campaigns 126 can be campaigns that do not use location-distance targeting.
- campaigns 126 that are selected to identify eligible content items responsive to the request for content 254 can include both types of targeting, e.g., resulting from campaigns with and without location-distance targeting.
- Eligible content items that do include location-distance targeting can be identified, for example, by the content management system 110 in the following way.
- location-distance targeting parameters 260 a - 260 c can be accessed from the campaigns 126 .
- the user's current location 208 can be compared against the distance ranges identified by the location-distance targeting parameters 260 a - 260 c .
- the user's current location 208 e.g., 400 miles from the San Francisco location 212
- a content item associated with the campaign 204 can be identified as an eligible content item, as can other content items that also meet the targeting requirements of the content item slot 250 .

- Content sponsors, for example, can target content to users based on their current location relative to a location associated with a content item (e.g., an advertisement). For example, a content sponsor C can submit offers (e.g., bids for use in an auction or an offer that is part of a reservation, hereinafter collectively referred to as an “offer”) for subsequent impressions of advertisements in a campaign that is targeted to users within one or more specified distances from a target location. The offers can depend, for example, on whether users to whom the content is to be presented are currently at a location within the distance(s) specified in the targeting criteria. Consequently, when content is requested for a particular user (e.g., to fill an advertisement slot on a web page or in a browser), the user's current location can be determined, and corresponding offers for content can be identified (e.g., from offers made by the content sponsor C and other content sponsors). For example, if the user's current location satisfies the distance criteria associated with the offer, then the bid for the content item can be identified. Depending on the terms of the offer, the content item associated with the content sponsor C can be provided in response to the request for content.
- A location, for example, can be a geographic location, (e.g., latitude/longitude coordinates), a point (e.g., an address) or a geographic feature that corresponds to a city, a metropolitan area, a county, a state, a region or a country. Distances between a user's location and a feature can be determined, for example, based on a point that represents the feature or based on a boundary associated with the feature. For example, distances can be determined relative to an address of a hotel or business (e.g., represented as a point) or relative to the boundary of a city, metropolitan area, county, state, region or country (e.g., represented as a perimeter, polygon or other shape).
- In one example scenario in which location-distance targeting can be used, consider an advertiser who has a hotel in San Francisco. For example, because of the location of the hotel, the advertiser may want advertisements associated with the hotel to be targeted to users who are a certain distance from the hotel and may be likely to need hotel accommodations when traveling to San Francisco. Ads for the hotel can be targeted to users who, for example, submit queries associated with San Francisco and whose current locations are far away (e.g., over 1000 miles). For example, the queries may signal an intent to visit San Francisco, a trip that may require a hotel room. This can provide the content sponsor with an opportunity to target users who may be more likely to engage with the content (e.g., an ad for the San Francisco hotel).
- In another example, a user in New York City may be running a map application that displays the San Francisco area, or the user may have a San Francisco business listing displayed (e.g., after submitting a query in a browser). Because the user's location of interest is far away (e.g., more than 1000 miles) from the user's current location, it may be likely that the user plans to travel to San Francisco. In this example, content sponsors (e.g., advertisers) who are hotel owners or airline ticket agencies may want to pay more to show their advertisements to remote users.
- In yet another example, users in Northern California may have business listings (e.g., evening shows in the Mission District) displayed in a web browser. While the users may not be interested in flying to San Francisco, they are also unlikely to drive home after the show. In this example, content sponsors may want to target the users for hotel-related advertisements, e.g., using a targeting distance that may require a hotel stay but no air travel.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for delivering content. Theexample environment 100 includes acontent management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers),content publishers 109, and thecontent management system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108 andcontent publishers 109. - In some implementations, the
environment 100 can include plural data stores that are used in various stages to target and deliver content based on location-distance targeting. For example, a data store ofcampaigns 126 can store campaigns that are created bycontent sponsors 108, e.g., using thesponsor interface 120. For example, thecampaigns 126 can include targeting criteria specified bycontent sponsors 108 to target content to users based at least in part on location-distance targeting. By way of example, location-distance targeting can include targeting of content based at least in part on the distance between the current location of a user and the geographic location associated with a content item. - In some implementations, the
content management system 110 includes a request handler that can receive a request for content from a user, identify one or more eligible content items, and provide a content item responsive to the request. More specifically, the request handler can determine, forcampaigns 126 that include location-distance targeting criteria, if the user who provided the request for content has a current location within a specified distance from the location associated with the content item. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, televisions, set-top boxes, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. The data representing theresource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots). - To facilitate searching of these resources, the
environment 100 can include asearch system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in anindexed cache 114. -
User devices 106 can submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response, thesearch system 112 accesses the indexedcache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 112 identifies the resources in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 is data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can generatesearch results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from thesearch system 112. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented. In some implementations, slots on search results pages or other web pages can include content slots for content items that have been provided as part of a reservation process. In a reservation process, a publisher and a content item sponsor enter into an agreement where the publisher agrees to publish a given content item (or campaign) in accordance with a schedule (e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X) or other publication criteria. In some implementations, content items that are selected to fill the requests for content slots can be selected based, at least in part, on priorities associated with a reservation process (e.g., based on urgency to fulfill a reservation) and information related to location-distance targeting. - When a
resource 105, search results 118 and/or other content are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 receives a request for content. The request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to thecontent management system 110. - For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the
content management system 110. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource orsearch query 116. - Based at least in part on data included in the request, the
content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. - The
content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, thecontent management system 110 can receive offers fromcontent sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource or search results page. For example, an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. For example, the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors. - A conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page. A conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable/observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or web page, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- In some implementations, the likelihood that a conversion will occur can be improved, such as by serving content that is more likely to be of interest to the user. For example, content items (e.g., ads) that are served can be selected in part based on location-distance targeting, which can also be an indication of how likely the user is to react positively to a content item, e.g., leading to a conversion.
- For situations in which the systems discussed here collect location information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect location information or use the information to target content. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user. Moreover, a user's geographic location may be generalized so that, for example, when location information is obtained (such as a city, ZIP code or state), a particular location of a user cannot be determined.

FIGS. 2A and 2B collectively show anexample system 200 for targeting and providing content to users based on location-distance targeting criteria.FIG. 2A , for instance, shows an examplecampaign sponsor interface 202 for specifying targeting criteria for acampaign 204 that includes advertisements for an Example San Francisco Hotel. The targeting criteria, for example, can be used to target advertisements to users based on the distance between the users' current locations and the location associated with the Example San Francisco Hotel. In some implementations, thesponsor interface 120 can provide thecampaign sponsor interface 202 and/or other interfaces for targeting content to users based on location-distance targeting. -
FIG. 2B shows anexample user interface 206 in which targeted content is provided based on a current location 208 of auser 210. As will be described in more detail below, theuser interface 206 is one example of how thesystem 200 can provide targeted content based at least in part on the user's current location relative to aSan Francisco location 212 associated with a content item. For example, advertisements from the content sponsor's advertising campaign (e.g., campaigns 126) can be provided in response to received requests to deliver content to theuser interface 206. - Referring again to
FIG. 2A , in some implementations, thecampaign sponsor interface 202 can include a targetingcriteria area 214 from which thecontent sponsor 108 can select targeting parameters for a campaign. For example, the targetingcriteria area 214 can be one of multiple areas within thecampaign sponsor interface 202. In some implementations, the targetingcriteria area 214 can include one or more controls for receiving an indication from thecontent sponsor 108 to target users using location-distance targeting. The location-distance targeting, for example, can be based on users' current locations (e.g., at content-serving time) relative to the location associated with the content item (e.g., the address of the Example San Francisco Hotel). - In some implementations, the
content sponsor 108 can select a location-distance targeting option 216, e.g., by checking a “Target users using location-distance targeting” checkbox. For example, selection of the location-distance targeting option 216 can result in the presentation and/or availability of anoptions area 218. - The
options area 218 can include various controls and displays including, e.g., distances 220 and bids 222. For example, the eachbid 222 can represent the amount that thecontent sponsor 108 is willing to pay (e.g., per 1,000 impressions) for impressions of content of thecampaign 204 to users whose current locations are within thedistance 220. In some implementations, distances can be represented using a range. For example, as shown inFIG. 2A ,entry 224 a includes abid 222 of $X for impressions of content to users whose current locations exceed 300 miles and are up to 500 miles from a geographic location 226 (e.g., the address of the Example San Francisco Hotel).Entry 224 b, for example, includes abid 222 of $Y for impressions of content to users whose current locations exceed 100 miles and are up to 300 miles from thegeographic location 226. - In some implementations, the
options area 218 can include amap 228 that can be used, for example, to display thegeographic location 226 associated with the content item. For example, themap 228 can be a map that includes California that includes thegeographic location 226 that is San Francisco. In some implementations, themap 228 can includemarkers map 228 that correspond todistances 220 associated with theentries markers entries map 228. - In some implementations, controls associated with the
map 228 can allow thecontent sponsor 108 to draw or select an area to which to target content. For example, an interface based on a positional marker (e.g., cursor, etc.) on the screen can be used to define a bounding region (e.g., by expanding one or more circles having radius) relative togeographic location 226. Pairs of concentric circles can indicate a range of distances associated with a particular bid. In some implementations, themap 228 can include controls for drawing a user-defined polygon or selecting a point, a building, an address, a ZIP code, a city, a county or a state from themap 228, any of which can also be defined using text input or using selection from a list. - In some implementations, the
campaign sponsor interface 202 can include anadd distance control 238 that thecontent sponsor 108 can use, for example, to add another entry similar to theentries add distance control 238, a popup (not shown inFIG. 2A ) can appear in which the content sponsor can enter a range of distances (e.g., 500 and 800) for yet another separate bid amount. Other ways can be used for enteringdistances 220 andbids 222 including, for example, tables, arrays and so on. - In some implementations, distances 220 and
bids 222 that appear in fields within theoptions area 218 can be edited directly, e.g., as text-entry fields. In some implementations, distance ranges can be expressed as a minimum distance up to infinity (e.g., “800 miles and beyond”). Other units can be used instead of miles. - In some implementations, a
control 240 can be used to create an entry similar to theentries bid 222 for the remainder of the distances. For example, after selection of thecontrol 240, thecontent sponsor 108 can specify $Z for abid 222 for the remainder of distances not represented by theentries - In some implementations, statistics can be presented for each range of distances. For example, one set of statistics can provide an estimate of the number of users who may be targeted for each of the different distance ranges.
- In some implementations, the
options area 218 can include a location definition control 242, e.g., for use in situations in which thegeographic location 226 is not a single point (e.g., the address of the Example San Francisco Hotel). For example, upon selection of the location definition control 242 by thecontent sponsor 108, a popup or other controls can appear by which the user can specify a location associated with thecampaign 204. Example locations include a city, county, state, ZIP code, or any user-defined polygon. - Referring to
FIG. 2B , theuser interface 206 can be, for example, a web page or some other interface (e.g., a web browser) that theuser 210 is using on theuser device 106. Theuser interface 206 can include one or morecontent item slots 250, e.g., for displaying advertisements. To fill thecontent item slots 250, for example, theuser interface 206 can provide a request forcontent 254 that is received by thecontent management system 110. Upon receipt of the request forcontent 254, thecontent management system 110 can provide one ormore content items 256 that are responsive to the request, as described above. As an example, thecontent items 256 that are provided can be selected based at least in part on location-distance targeting described with reference toFIG. 2A . - The
user 210 for which the request forcontent 254 occurs can be physically situated at the current location 208, e.g. somewhere in Northern California. For example, the user's location can be determined using global positioning system (GPS) capabilities of the user's mobile device, or based on an address voluntarily provided by the user, e.g., in a profile for a non-mobile computer. Upon receipt of the request forcontent 254, thecontent management system 110 can access information in thecampaigns 126 to identify content items that are responsive to the request. Somecampaigns 126, for example, can include location-distance targeting, as described above with reference toFIG. 2A .Other campaigns 126 can be campaigns that do not use location-distance targeting. As a result, campaigns 126 that are selected to identify eligible content items responsive to the request forcontent 254 can include both types of targeting, e.g., resulting from campaigns with and without location-distance targeting. - Eligible content items that do include location-distance targeting can be identified, for example, by the
content management system 110 in the following way. For example, for thecampaign 204 defined for content items related to the Example San Francisco Hotel, location-distance targeting parameters 260 a-260 c can be accessed from thecampaigns 126. The user's current location 208 can be compared against the distance ranges identified by the location-distance targeting parameters 260 a-260 c. For example, the user's current location 208 (e.g., 400 miles from the San Francisco location 212) can be determined to fall within the distance range of 300-500 miles identified by the location-distance targeting parameters 260 b. As a result, a content item associated with thecampaign 204 can be identified as an eligible content item, as can other content items that also meet the targeting requirements of thecontent item slot 250. - In some implementations, the one or more
eligible content items 256 can be evaluated by conducting an auction. For example, the auction can include one or more bids associated with the content sponsors 108 that elected to target users using location-distance targeting described with reference toFIG. 2A . As a result, thecontent items 256 that are provided can be based at least in part on the auction and the location-distance information, as well as other information that can typically be used for selecting content items, e.g., including the relevance of content items to keywords, or criteria for selecting content to fulfill reservations, to name a few examples. - In another example, consider targeting for a Kansas State Lottery advertising campaign that includes advertisements targeted to nearby non-residents in neighboring states. For example, the campaign can include location-
distance targeting parameters 262 b that include a $K bid for 1000 impressions to users whosecurrent location 264 is within a 50-mile-wide targetedzone 266 that surrounds Kansas. For example, the targetedzone 266 can be calculated automatically by thecampaign sponsor interface 202 after thecontent sponsor 108 associated with the campaign selects Kansas (e.g., from a list of states) after selecting the location definition control 242. The location-distance targeting parameters 262 b can be used, for example, when a user who lives in Nebraska, five miles across the border with Kansas, is running a web browser. In response to a request forcontent 254 to fill a content item slot in the user's browser, thecontent management system 110 can determine that the user'scurrent location 264 falls within the targeted range (e.g., 0.001 to 50 miles), and an ad related to the Kansas State Lottery can be provided as thecontent item 256. The location-distance targeting parameters 262 b can prevent the Kansas State Lottery advertisement from reaching users who are not in the targetedzone 266. For example, the advertisement may not be provided to a user at alocation 268 inside Kansas (e.g., if the range excludes those inside the state) or a user at alocation 270 that is more than 50 miles from the Kansas border. -
FIG. 3A is a flowchart of anexample process 300 for targeting content using location-distance targeting criteria. Specifically, the targeting is based, at least in part, on the distance between a user's current location and the location associated with a content item. Theprocess 300 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110.FIGS. 2A-2B are used to provide examples for steps of theprocess 300. - An indication is received from a content sponsor to create or modify a campaign for presenting content to one or more users responsive to received requests to deliver content (302). For example, the
content sponsor 108 can use controls in thecampaign sponsor interface 202 to create or select a campaign 204 (such as one that includes advertisements for an Example San Francisco Hotel). The selection of thecampaign 204, for example, can be to define the targeting parameters, including location-distance targeting parameters. Parameters can be defined for a new campaign or can be modified for an existing campaign. - Targeting criteria for the campaign is received, including receiving an indication to target content based at least in part on one or more distances of a user from a geographic location associated with the campaign (304). The targeting criteria includes one or more bids for the presentation of content associated with the geographic location. The presentation of the content is to occur in response to a request for content from a particular user and when a current location of the particular user is within a certain distance relative to the geographic location. For example, the
content sponsor 108 can use thecampaign sponsor interface 202 as described above. Specifically, thecontent sponsor 108 can specify one or more distances (e.g., ranges of distances) and bids corresponding to the distances. For example, the one or more bids (e.g., $X and $Y) can include different bids on plural different distances (e.g., 100-300 miles, and 300-500 miles). The distances can be relative to a point (e.g., the address of a store), a named entity (e.g., a city, state, ZIP code, etc.), or a user-defined polygon. - In some implementations, the geographic location to be associated with the campaign is provided or determined. For example, the user may be prompted to provide the geographic location (e.g., the address of the Example San Francisco Hotel). Alternatively, another form of location (a city, county, metro, region, state, etc.) can be defined as the geographic location. In some implementations, the location can be inferred. When inferred, the geographic location can be presented to the user for confirmation.
- The campaign is stored (306). For example, the
campaign sponsor interface 202 can store the targeting information and other campaign information in thecampaigns 126. - The content is delivered to users in accordance with the campaign and responsive to requests for content received from a user with a current location within the certain distance relative to the geographic location (308). For example, the
content management system 110 can provide one ormore content items 256 in response to the request forcontent 254. The content items selected can include, for example, the selection of the advertisement for the Example San Francisco Hotel. At least in part, the selection can occur because the distance (e.g., 400 miles) of the current location of theuser 210 is within the distance range of 300-500 miles from San Francisco, as identified in the location-distance targeting parameters 260 b. - In some implementations, the
content item 256 that is provided can be based on conducting an auction. The auction can use the one or more bids associated withcontent sponsors 108, some of which can specify to target content using location-distance targeting. Some bids may include no preference for targeting content using location-distance targeting and can be evaluated along with the bids ofcontent sponsors 108 that do target content using location-distance targeting. -
FIG. 3B is a flowchart of an example process 320 for serving content using location-distance targeting criteria. More specifically, the process 320 provides content items based, at least in part, on the distance between a user's current location and the location associated with the content item. Thecontent management system 110, for example, can use one or more computing devices to perform at least some of steps of the process 320.FIG. 2B is used to provide examples for steps of the process 320. - A request is received for a content item to be served to a user (322). For example, the
content management system 110 can receive the request forcontent 354, e.g., to fill thecontent item slot 250. - One or more content items responsive to the request are identified (324). At least one of the content items includes targeting criteria that is based at least in part on a location associated with the user. For example, the
content management system 110 can identify the Example San Francisco Hotel advertisement from thecampaign 204. - A specified location associated with the one content item is identified (326). As an example, the
content management system 110 can identify theSan Francisco location 212 as the location, e.g., by using information in thecampaign 204. - A current location of the user is identified (328). For example, the current location (e.g., northeast of the San Francisco location 212) for the
user 210 can be identified using GPS or some other location identification technology contained in or associated with theuser device 106. - A distance from the current location to the specified location is determined (330). As an example, the
content management system 110 can determine that the distance between the user's current location 208 and theSan Francisco location 212 is 400 miles. - A determination is made whether the distance satisfies the targeting criteria associated with the one content item (332). When the distance satisfies the targeting criteria, the one content item can be included in an auction along with other eligible content items responsive to the request.
- Winning results of the auction are provided responsive to the request (334). For example, if the bid of $Y associated with the location-
distance targeting parameters 260 b is relatively higher than other bids in the auction (e.g., when multiplied by quality scores or other factors), then the Example San Francisco Hotel advertisement can be the content item that wins the auction and is provided as thecontent items 256. -
FIG. 3C is a flowchart of anotherexample process 340 for serving content using location-distance targeting criteria. More specifically, theprocess 340 provides content items based, at least in part, on the distance between a user's current location and the location associated with the content item. Thecontent management system 110, for example, can use one or more computing devices to perform at least some of steps of theprocess 340.FIG. 2B is used to provide examples for steps of theprocess 340. - A request is received for a content item to be served to a user (342). For example, the
content management system 110 can receive the request forcontent 354, e.g., to fill thecontent item slot 250. - A content item is identified from an inventory of content items that is responsive to the request (344). The content item is associated with targeting criteria that is based on a location associated with the user. As an example, the
content management system 110 can identify one or more eligible content items from campaigns that include location-distance targeting, e.g., including the Example San Francisco Hotel advertisement that is part of thecampaign 204. - A specified location associated with the content item is identified (346). For example, the
content management system 110 can identify theSan Francisco location 212 as the location, e.g., by using information in thecampaign 204. In some implementations, identifying the specified location can include defining the specified location using a feature selected from the group comprising a point, a building, an address, a ZIP code, a city, a county, a state or a user-defined polygon. - A current location of the user is identified (348). For example, the current location (e.g., northeast of the San Francisco location 212) for the
user 210 can be identified using GPS or some other location identification technology contained in or associated with theuser device 106. - A distance from the current location to the specified location is determined (350). As an example, the
content management system 110 can determine that the distance between the user's current location 208 and theSan Francisco location 212 is 400 miles. - A determination is made whether the distance satisfies the targeting criteria associated with the content item (352). For example, the
content management system 110 can determine if aparticular campaign 126 includes location-distance targeting that targets a distance (e.g., the range 300-500 miles) that includes the 400 mile distance relative to the current location. - When the distance satisfies the targeting criteria, the one content item is included as an eligible content item for providing content responsive to the received request (354). For example, the
content management system 110 can include the Example San Francisco Hotel advertisement with the other eligible content items, any of which can be selected as the content item(s) 256 to be provided in response to the request forcontent 254. - In some implementations, an auction can be conducted that includes the content item (e.g., selected using location-distance targeting) along with other eligible content items. For example, the
content management system 110 can use a selection process, such as an auction or a reservation system, to evaluate the content item along with one or more eligible content items. As a result of the selection process, the content can be served in response to the request for content. -
