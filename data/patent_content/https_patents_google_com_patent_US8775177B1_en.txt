Definitions
- This disclosure relates generally to speech recognition.
- Speech recognition includes processes for converting spoken words to text or other data.
- speech recognition systems translate verbal utterances into a series of computer-readable sounds and compare those sounds to known words.
- a microphone may accept an analog signal, which is converted into a digital form that is then divided into smaller segments. The digital segments can be compared to elements of a spoken language. Based on this comparison, and an analysis of the context in which those sounds were uttered, the system is able to recognize the speech.
- a typical speech recognition system may include an acoustic model, a language model, and a dictionary.
- an acoustic model includes digital representations of individual sounds that are combinable to produce a collection of words, phrases, etc.
- a language model assigns a probability that a sequence of words will occur together in a particular sentence or phrase.
- a dictionary transforms sound sequences into words that can be understood by the language model.
- a speech recognition process may perform the following operations: performing a preliminary recognition process on first audio to identify candidates for the first audio; generating first templates corresponding to the first audio, where each first template includes a number of elements; selecting second templates corresponding to the candidates, where the second templates represent second audio, and where each second template includes elements that correspond to the elements in the first templates; comparing the first templates to the second templates, where comparing includes determining similarity metrics between the first templates and corresponding second templates; applying weights to the similarity metrics to produce weighted similarity metrics, where the weights are associated with corresponding second templates; and using the weighted similarity metrics to determine whether the first audio corresponds to the second audio.
- the speech recognition systems may include one or more of the following features, either alone or in combination.

- HMM Hidden Markov Model
- the operations may include combining the first scores and the second scores using a conditional random field technique to generate a composite score indicative of an extent to which the first audio corresponds to the second audio.

- FIG. 1 shows a conceptual example of a system for performing speech recognition according to the processes described herein.
- a user 100 of a mobile device 101 accesses a speech recognition system 104 .
- the mobile device 101 is a cellular telephone having advanced computing capabilities, known as a smartphone.
- Speech recognition system 104 may be hosted by one or more server(s) that is/are remote from mobile device 101 .
- speech recognition system 104 may be part of another service available to users of the mobile device 101 (e.g., a help service, a search service, etc.).
- mobile device 101 may include an application 107 (“app”) that receives input audio (e.g., speech) provided by user 100 and that transmits data 110 representing that input audio to the speech recognition system 104 .
- App 107 may have any appropriate functionality, e.g., it may be a search app, a messaging app, an e-mail app, and so forth.
- an app is used as an example in this case.
- all or part of the functionality of the app 107 may be part of another program downloaded to mobile device 101 , part of another program provisioned on mobile device 101 , part of the operating system of the mobile device 101 , or part of a service available to mobile device 101 .
- app 107 may ask user 100 to identify, beforehand, the languages that user 100 speaks.
- the user 100 may select, e.g., via a touch-screen menu item or voice input, the languages that user 100 expects to speak or have recognized.
- user 100 may also select among various accents or dialects.
- the user's languages, accents, and/or dialects may be determined based on the audio input itself or based on prior audio or other appropriate input.
- Speech recognition system 104 includes one or more of each of the following: an acoustic model 115 , a language model 116 , and a dictionary 117 .
- acoustic model 115 includes digital representations of individual sounds that are combinable to produce a collection of words, phrases, etc.
- Language model 116 assigns a probability that a sequence of words will occur together in a particular sentence or phrase.
- Dictionary 117 dictionary transforms sound sequences into words that can be understood by language model 116 .
- acoustic model 115 includes two stages: a “first pass” stage 115 a and a “second pass” stage 115 b .
- first pass stage 115 a is implemented using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based system, which identifies recognition candidates and assigns scores thereto.
- Second pass stage 115 b uses templates, such as vectors, to represent input audio. These vectors are compared to other vectors that represent known words, phrases or other sound sequences. Distances between vectors for input audio and for known audio correspond to a likelihood that the input audio matches the known audio. The distances, which correspond to scores, are used in adjusting the score(s) from the first pass stage to identify a best recognition candidate for the input audio.
- a conditional random field process may be used to combine the scores from the first pass stage and the second pass stage to identify the candidate. The first pass stage is described initially, followed by the second pass stage.
- the HMM-based system uses one or more state machines to identify first pass recognition candidates.
- a state machine may be used to recognize an unknown input.
- the state machine determines a sequence of known states representing sounds that that best match input speech. This best-matched sequence is deemed to be the state machine's hypothesis for the input speech.
- the audio element recognized in the first pass stage may be a part of a word (e.g., a syllable), phoneme, etc; a whole word, phoneme, etc.; a part of a sequence of words, phonemes, etc., and so forth.
- each state in the state machine receives the best incoming path to that state (e.g., the incoming path with the lowest cost), determines how good a match incoming audio is to itself, produces a result called the “state matching cost”, and outputs data corresponding to this result to successor state(s).
- the combination of state matching costs with the lowest cost incoming path is referred to as the “path cost”.
- the path with the lowest path cost may be selected as the best-matched sequence for the input speech.
- a “path” includes a sequence of states through a state machine that are compared to input audio data.
- a “path cost” includes a sum of matching costs (e.g., costs of matching a state to a segment of audio) and transition costs (costs to transition from a state_i to a state_j).
- a “best path cost” includes the “path” with the lowest “path cost”.
- a state in a state machine may have several different states that can transition to the current state. To determine the “best input path” leading into a state, the “path cost” for each path arriving at a current state should be known. If any of the incoming “path costs” are unknown at the current time, then the “best path cost” for this state cannot be determined until incoming path costs become known.
- user 101 utters input speech, e.g., the word “recognize”, into mobile device 101 .
- Mobile device 101 converts the input speech into audio data 110 .
- the audio data is part of a continuous stream that is sent from a microphone to speech recognition system 104 .
- the speech is received at acoustic model 115 at both the first and second pass stages.
- the part of the speech recognition process performed by acoustic model 115 employs state machine 200 that include states 201 .
- states may represent sub-phonemes in the English language.
- a phoneme is the smallest piece of sound that provides meaningful distinctions between different words in one or more languages (e.g., every word has a sequence of phonemes).
- the acoustic data of phonemes are further broken down into smaller components called sub-phonemes, which can facilitate more accurate speech recognition (since smaller units of sound are recognized).
- state machine 200 determines best path cost 204 , which corresponds to a sequence of sub-phonemes that best matches the corresponding input audio element. The better the match is between an audio element and a sequence of sub-phonemes, the smaller the resulting path cost is. Therefore, in this example, the best path cost corresponds to the sequence of sub-phonemes which has the smallest path cost.
- the speech recognition system includes a state machine 200 with M states, where M ⁇ 1.
- Audio element, “recognize”, can be broken-down into the following set of sub-phonemes: r-r-r-eh-eh-eh-k-k-ao-ao-g-g-g-n-n-ay-ay-z-z-z, which are labeled as follows: r1, r2, r3, eh1, eh2, eh3, k1, k2, k3, ao1, ao2, ao3, g1, g2, g3, n1, n2, n3, ay1, ay2, ay3, z1, z2, z3.
- State machine 200 should ultimately find the best path to be the following sequence of sub-phoneme states: r1, r2, r3, eh1, eh2, eh3, k1, k2, k3, ao1, ao2, ao3, g1, g2, g3, n1, n2, n3, ay1, ay2, ay3, z1, z2, z3.
- first pass stage 115 a of the acoustic model compares the input audio to its model for the word “recognize” and finds a candidate 208 with a best path cost.
- the candidate corresponds to the sequence of sub-phonemes that has the lowest path cost. More than one best path cost may be obtained in some cases. For example, if determined best path costs are close (e.g., within a predefined tolerance of each other or another metric), several candidates may be selected. One or more words, phrases, etc. 208 thus may be identified and sent to second pass stage 115 b for further processing.
- the input audio is broken-down into time duration segments.
- the segments may be, for example, 10 ms each or any other appropriate duration.
- An average word is around 500 ms. So, in the 10 ms example, an average word contains about 50 segments. Other words, however, may have fewer or lesser numbers of segments.
- the segments are represented by templates.
- the templates include vectors 210 having a number of features (e.g., one feature per dimension of a vector). In an example implementation, there are 39 features per vector; however, other implementations may use different numbers of features.
- the acoustic model is not a series of states as in the first pass stage, but rather a number of vectors for a sound sequence (e.g., a word or phrase).
- a sound sequence e.g., a word or phrase.
- vectors for input audio are generated by performing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the input audio to obtain its frequency components.
- FFT Fast Fourier Transform
- a cosine transformation is performed on the frequency components to obtain features for the vectors.
- thirteen features are obtained per 10 ms segment.
- First and second derivatives of those features are taken over time to obtain an additional 26 features to produce the full 39 features for a vector.
- PLP perceptual linear prediction
- MFCC Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients
- second pass stage 115 b stored vectors 211 are identified that correspond to recognition candidate(s) identified in first pass stage 115 a .
- the speech recognition system generates, identifies, and stores in a database, vectors for different speech elements.
- the speech element is a word; however, vectors may be pre-stored in a database for syllables phrases, word combinations, or other sounds sequences as well, and used as described herein to recognize more or less than a single word.
- audio is recognized and vectors are generated for the corresponding audio as described above.
- the audio may be recognized using automatic and/or manual recognition processes.
- the training data may be unsupervised or supervised.
- input audio may be for the word “recognize”.
- the input audio is recognized, e.g., using a standard HMM-based approach with, or without, manual (e.g., human) confirmation.
- Vectors for that input audio may be generated and stored in memory. For example, if the audio is the word “recognize”, and that word is 1000 ms in duration, then there are 100 vectors stored, one for each 10 ms of audio on the word “recognize”.
- the foregoing process may be performed, during the training phase, for various instances of the word “recognize”. For example, different groups of vectors may be generated for the word “recognize” spoken using different speech patterns, for different durations, in different accents, in different (e.g., noise or quiet) environments, in different word contexts, and so forth.
- the result may be numerous groups of vectors, all of which represent different versions of the same words e.g., “recognize”.
- the vectors may differ in content for reasons noted above, and may be used in the second pass stage to generate a recognition candidate for the input audio in the manner described herein.
- the training phase may associate metadata with each vector identifying, e.g., the word that the vector represents.
- each vector may also be assigned a weight, which may be represented by metadata.
- the weights may be indicative or the likelihood (e.g., a confidence or relevance score) that the vector representation is accurate. For example, higher weights (indicative of more accuracy) may be assigned to manually-verified vector representations than for vector representations that are not manually verified.
- vector representations for noisy audio, or other audio that is deemed generally unreliable for some reason may be assigned lower weights (indicative of less accuracy), since such noise may affect recognition accuracy.
- vector representations for audio that exceeds a predefined noise threshold may be assigned weights of zero.
- a regularization process may be used to obtain the weights of zero.
- the weight assigned to the vector may be proportionate to the noise level of the associated audio, or to its reliability in general.
- the weights may be negative, which indicates a negative correlation between a vector representation and audio.
- the weights may be determined using a conditional random field technique.
- the metadata may also identify other features associated with the input audio.
- the metadata may identify one or more words that neighbor the word that is the subject of a vector.
- neighbor may include, but is not limited to, one or more words either before or after the word at issue.
- the one or more words are directly before or after the word at issue; however, this need not be the case always.
- the metadata may also identify other contextual aspects of the audio.
- the metadata may specify a source of the audio, e.g., a television network, an online video service, a video device (e.g., a digital video camera), and so forth.
- the metadata may also include, if available, information about the linguistic characteristics of the audio, e.g., the speaker's accent, location, and so forth.
- the metadata may also identify the condition of the audio, e.g., whether the audio is noisy, the amount of noise, the type of noise, and so forth.
- Vectors stored in the training phase are used in second pass stage 115 b in recognizing input audio. More specifically, vectors are identified, in storage, for a first pass stage recognition candidate. Vector for the input audio (the “input audio vectors”) are compared 215 to the stored vectors, and are scored against the stored vectors. In this example, the scores are based, at least in part, on a calculated distance between the input audio vectors and each stored vector. In some implementations, the calculated distance between two vectors is the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. In an example, the DTW distance is the summed Euclidean distances of the best warping of two vectors. The warping usually is subject to certain constraints, for example, monotonicity and bounded jump size. The DTW distance can be determined using dynamic programming techniques, with a complexity quadratic in a number of frames. The DTW distance may be length-normalized, if necessary, to make vectors of different length comparable.
- DTW Dynamic Time Warping
- the DTW distance is indicative of how closely the input audio corresponds to the word represented by stored vectors.
- the DTW distances between the input audio vectors 210 and stored vectors 211 for “recognize” are indicative of how closely input audio corresponds to the word “recognize”.
- This DTW distances may be determined for any number (e.g., all or a subset) of stored vectors for the same word.
- the DTW distances for various vector comparisons may be considered together or combined mathematically to provide an indication of a likelihood that the input audio is a known word.
- scores 219 resulting from the first pass stage and score 220 resulting from the second pass stage are both used to produce an overall score indicative of how well the input audio matches a word.
- a combiner module 211 which implements a conditional random field technique, may be used to generate a final recognition score and thus an output recognition candidate 224 .
- Factors other than the DTW distances and first pass stage scores may also affect the final recognition score.
- weights applied to the stored vectors may affect the amount that those stored vectors contribute to the final recognition score.
- the output of the second pass stage may be adjusted (e.g., multiplied by) weights for corresponding pre-stored vectors.
- Vectors that are deemed reliable representations of audio e.g., manually-confirmed vectors or vectors generated from audio having low levels of noise
- vector weights are identified prior to vector identification. Only those vectors having (e.g., positive) non-zero weights, or weights that exceed a predefined threshold, may be identified and compared against a vector for input audio. As a result, the amount of vector comparisons that are performed can be reduced. In other implementations, the zero-weighted vectors may be identified; however, their zero weight effectively discounts their effect on the final score.
- neighboring words may be used to adjust scores resulting from DTW distances.
- the input audio may include the word “to”, neighbored by “going”, as in “going to”.
- metadata may be associated with the resulting recognition candidate indicating that the word “going” precedes the word “to”. This information may be used to adjust the weight applied to the DTW distance. For example, in some cases, if it is known what a predecessor word was, the weight may be adjusted so that the resulting score is downgraded or upgraded. For example, “thereto” is a word that ends in “to”.
- a recognition result for the word “to” may be downgraded (e.g., by adjusting the weight for its corresponding vectors downward) to reflect the possibility that the word “to” is part of “thereto”, rather than the stand-alone word “to”.
- more than one neighboring word or sound sequence may affect the determination.
- succeeding neighbor words may affect applied weights.
- neighboring words may affect which vectors are identified for comparison with the input audio. For example, if neighboring words are known, vectors reflecting a combination of those neighboring words with the word at issue may be identified and compared to the input audio. This may reduce the number of comparisons that occur, particularly where there are large numbers of vector examples for words (e.g., for prepositions, such as “to”).
- Metadata such as that described above for the vectors produced in the training phase, may be associated with vectors generated from the input audio, in cases where the appropriate information is available.
- the metadata for the input audio vectors may be used in scoring stored vectors. For example, the metadata of input audio vectors may be matched to corresponding metadata of stored vectors and, where matches are/are not present, recognition scores may be adjusted.
- the final recognition output constitutes recognized audio.
- the recognized audio 119 may include, e.g., a textual transcription of the audio, language information associated with included recognition candidates, or other information representative of its content.
- the recognized audio 119 may be provided as data to the mobile device 101 that provided the input audio.

- the recognized audio 119 may be provided to the mobile device 101 or another service and used to control one or more functions associated with the mobile device 101 .

- the recognized audio 119 may be used to populate an e-mail or other message. Processes may be implemented, either remote from, or local to, mobile device 101 , to identify commands in an application, such as “send e-mail” to cause actions to occur, such as executing an e-mail application, on mobile device 101 .
- recognized audio 119 may be provided as data to a search engine.
- recognized audio 119 may constitute a search query that is to be input to a search engine.
- the search engine may identify content (e.g., Web pages, images, documents, and the like) that are relevant to the search query, and return that information to the computing device that provided the initial audio.

- the training phase may include making a manual determination about the identity of input audio. For example, a person may identify the audio or confirm the accuracy of the result produced by an HMM-based system. In other implementations, a person may identify the audio without the assistance of the HMM-based system.
- the automatic portion of the recognition may be a system other than an HMM-based system.
- Vectors are generated ( 403 ) for the audio.
- vectors for input audio are generated by performing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the audio to obtain its frequency components.
- FFT Fast Fourier Transform
- a cosine transformation is performed on the frequency components to obtain features for the vectors.
- thirteen features are obtained.
- First and second derivatives of those features are taken over time to obtain an additional 26 features to produce the full 39 features for a vector.
- PLP perceptual linear prediction
- MFCC Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients
- Information is associated ( 404 ) with the generated vectors.
- the information may include weights and metadata, including, but not limited to, the weights and metadata described above.
- the applied weights and metadata if appropriate, are used to generate outputs for known audio. Accordingly, a testing phase may be part of the training. If the applied weights do not generate the appropriate output during testing, then the applied weights may be adjusted until the appropriate output is obtained.
- the model weights may be estimated using a maximum mutual information (MMI) training criterion.
- MMI maximum mutual information
- regularization may be used for feature selection.
- regularization may be used to avoid overfitting. Processing may be performed using the general-purpose L-BFGS or Rprop techniques.
- the information associated ( 404 ) with the generated vectors may also identify a word or phrase associated with each vector.
- a single vector will not typically represent an entire word.
- a group of such vectors e.g., 50
- the metadata associated with each vector may identify the word or phrase that the vector is part of, and what part of the word or phrase the vector represents.
- the metadata may specify that the word that a vector is part of is “recognize” and it may specify what part of the word “recognize” that the vector represents (e.g., the first 10 ms, the tenth 10 ms, and so forth).
- a group of vectors is not representative of audio (e.g., a negative representation) and may be indicated as such in metadata.
- Vectors and associated metadata are stored (405) in a database.
- the vectors may be indexed, e.g., by word or words, for retrieval.
- the training process continues 406 for all or part of the corpus of audio.
- the training may be updated, as desired, using new audio or the same audio.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram for an example process 500 for performing speech recognition.
- Process 500 may be performed by speech recognition module 314 of FIG. 3 , either alone or in combination with one or more other appropriate computer programs.
- audio is received (501).
- speech recognition module 314 may receive audio from a computing device, such as mobile device 101 ( FIG. 1 ).
- the input audio referred to herein may include all of the audio received between designated start and stop times, or a portion or snippet thereof.
- the audio is input speech; however, any type of audio may be received.
- the audio may be a recorded musical track, a recorded track associated with video, and so forth.
- Phonemes (“phones”) are identified in the input audio and may be used, as described below, to identify the content of the audio.
- a recognition process is performed ( 502 ) on the input audio.
- the recognition process may be performed by first pass module 340 .
- first pass module 340 is an HMM-based system (e.g., like first pass stage 115 a of FIGS. 1 and 2 ), as described above, which produces scored recognition candidates.
- Candidates for recognition of the input audio are identified ( 503 ) by their scores. For example, one or more candidates with the highest recognition scores may be identified and selected. A predefined number of candidates may be selected, or those within a predefined tolerance of the candidate with the highest score may be selected. Selection criteria other than these may also be used.
- the candidates are provided to second pass module 341 . There, at least some of the following operations may be performed to generate final recognition candidates (e.g., a best recognition candidate).
- Vectors are generated ( 504 ) for the input audio.
- the vectors may be for 10 ms segments of the audio, as described above, and may include appropriate metadata.
- Vectors that may correspond to the input audio are identified ( 505 ) in the database.
- the vectors that are identified are vectors for the words, phrase, etc. of audio recognized in the first pass stage. For example, if the first pass stage has identified candidates of “recognize”, “recognized”, and “ignition”, then vectors corresponding to those words are identified in the database based, e.g., on their associated metadata. For example, a search of an index may be performed to identify the vectors. In some implementations, all vectors corresponding to a recognition candidate are identified.
- a subset of all vectors corresponding to a recognition candidate is identified. For example, vectors with weights that are at, or below, a predefined value, e.g., zero, may be excluded from consideration. In this case, it is possible to reduce the effects of noise or other artifacts on the recognition process. Furthermore, as a result, the amount of processing performed is reduced (since vectors with zero weights need not be processed). Thus, the metadata may be used to reduce the amount of processing performed, since it can result in consideration of fewer numbers of vectors than would otherwise be considered.
- a predefined value e.g., zero
- all stored vectors may not be accurately labeled.
- vectors for “recognize” may be inaccurately labeled as being for “recognition”.
- the effects of inaccurately-labeled vectors may be mitigated in some cases.
- the vectors for the input audio are compared ( 506 ) to the identified vectors for the recognition candidates to determine similarity metrics between the vectors for the input audio and the identified vectors.
- the similarity metric may be based on DTW distances between vectors, as noted above.
- the similarity metrics may be such that they reduce the effects of noise and errors on recognition.
- template features (f) may be based on a segmented word W (e.g., broken into segments of 10 ms) and frame features X associated with this word segment.
- a template feature is set to the average DTW distance between a recognition hypothesis X (e.g., the vector for recognition candidate from the first pass stage) and the k-nearest vectors of X associated with the hypothesis word W, where Y ⁇ KNN W (X) (KNN, meaning “k-nearest neighbor vectors) if the word hypothesis W I matches the template word W. Otherwise, the template feature is set to zero. This is expressed in the following equation:
- individual DTW distances are used as the template features.
- the DTW distances may be exponentiated to achieve a more sparse representation and thus, in some cases, faster training.
- this non-linearity enables modeling of arbitrary decision boundaries. This is expressed in the following equation:
- f Y kernel ⁇ ( X , W ) ⁇ exp ⁇ ( - ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ d ⁇ ( X , Y ) ) 0 ⁇ if ⁇ ⁇ Y ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ template ⁇ ⁇ of ⁇ ⁇ W otherwise ⁇ , in the above equation, is a scaling factor.
- the similarity metric may be adjusted by weights associated with the corresponding vectors.
- the similarity metric may be adjusted in accordance with other metadata associated with the vectors (e.g., the identity(ies) of neighboring words, the context of the audio, and so forth).
- the output of second pass module 341 includes one or more scores (e.g., one or more template features) that are indicative of how well the recognition candidate from first pass module matches vectors from database 335 .
- the scores produced by first pass module 340 are re-scored ( 507 ) using the scores produced by second pass module 341 to identify ( 508 ) which of the recognition candidates best matches the input audio.
- the combination of the template features from the second pass module with the first pass scores is performed using a segmental conditional random field.
- a segmental conditional random field is a conditional random field defined on word lattices.
- the features of the conditional random field are defined on the word arc level.
- language and acoustic model scores are used as features. As a result, the re-scoring result is no worse than the first-pass baseline result.
- the resulting output ( 509 ) of speech recognition module 314 may be applied to language model 332 that generates a phonetic representation of the selected (e.g., best) recognition candidate, along with other appropriate information identifying the word or phrase.
- Dictionary 333 may be used to transform sound sequences into words that can be understood by the language model.
- Data corresponding to the selected recognition candidate is output as a recognized version of the audio.
- speech recognition module may output the data to the appropriate device or process.
- the output may be formatted as part of an XML file, a text transcription, a command or command sequence, a search query, and so forth.
- the data may be presented to the user, either audibly or visually, or it may be used as part of a process either on the user's device or elsewhere.
- a transcription of the input audio may be applied to a translation service, which may be programmed to generate an audio and/or textual translation of the input audio into another, different language (e.g., from English to French) for output to the user's computing device.
- the user may be able to specify the accent or dialect of the target language for the output audio.
